Please review the order below entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York regarding document preservation.  You are instructed to comply with this order, effective immediately. 

The order requires that we retain all documents (in paper or electronic form) in existence on February 15.  Documents created after February 15 must be retained if, as the order states, the document contains information relevant to:  (1) any claim or defense that may be asserted in the bankruptcy by Enron or a party-in-interest; (2) the financial condition or otherwise in connection with the reorganization of Enron under the Bankruptcy Code; or (3) any governmental investigation or litigation now underway or commenced prior to the termination of this order concerning (a) Enron or any Enron-related affiliates or individuals, (b) present or former directors or officers of Enron, or (c) any affilitiates, subsidiaries, partnerships or joint ventures or other entities which, to Enron's knowledge, Enron or any Enron-related entity participated.

Please regard the terms of the Order as applying to all Enron companies, not just companies that are a part of the bankruptcy proceeding.  If you are uncertain whether you should retain any particular document, please call Bob Williams at extension 5-2402.  You should err on the side of retaining the document.

This order and email instruction supersede the previous order of the Bankruptcy Court and email to employees dated January 14, 2002.

Thank you.

The text of the order follows:

Enron's estates; and

WHEREAS, Enron recognizes that it must preserve
all of its Documents during the pendency of these Chapter
11 cases;

WHEREAS, Enron has represented that it has by
various e-mails, including one dated as recently as January

accordance with then-existing policies;

WHEREAS, Enron has represented that it has placed
under lock-and-key all paper shredding machines located at

hereto).

IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED THAT:
1. Enron, and its officers and directors, shall
make reasonable efforts to ensure that none of Enron's
Documents shall be destroyed or wrongfully removed from
Enron's premises in a manner inconsistent with the terms of
the Order.

2. To the extent that Enron's Documents are in
the possession of its agents, accountants or any other
party which maintains documents for, on behalf of or for
the benefit of Enron, Enron shall in writing instruct such
persons to preserve Enron's Documents within ten (10)
business days of the date of this Order, such notice to
include a copy of this Order.

3. All Documents that were in the possession,
custody or control of Enron prior to the date of this
Order, shall be preserved and maintained by Enron and each
of its directors, officers and employees.

4. All Documents that come into the possession,
custody or control of Enron from and after the date of this
Order that contain information (i) relevant to any claim or
defense thereto that may be asserted in these chapter 11
cases by Enron or a party-in-interest, (ii) relevant to the
financial condition or otherwise in connection with the

partnerships or joint ventures or other entities in which,
to Enron's knowledge, Enron or any Enron-related entity
participated (collectively, "Affiliated Entities") now
underway or commenced prior to the termination of this
Order, shall be preserved and maintained by Enron and each
of its directors, officers and employees, provided,
however, that this Order does not bar the ordinary course

reasonable or apparent connection to the items listed in
subparts (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph.

5. Nothing contained in this Order shall: (a)
prevent Enron from using any Documents in the ordinary
course of business for any purpose necessary to the
reorganization effort; or (b) entitle any entity to
discovery other than pursuant to applicable law.

6. To the extent the Federal Bureau of
Investigation ("FBI") discloses to Enron its findings or
conclusions in connection with its investigation of alleged
document destruction on Enron's premises, and to the extent
the FBI permits Enron to disclose such findings or
conclusions, Enron shall report to the Court such findings

were removed or destroyed, (i) the nature of such
documents, (ii) the person(s) responsible for such
destruction or removal, and (iii) measures being taken to
retrieve or restore such documents.

most senior accounting officers, and its three other most
senior officers shall submit affidavits stating that such
persons have reviewed this Order, understand its terms, and
will make reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions

8. The terms of this Order shall supercede and
control any prior policy or announcement by Enron
concerning document preservation or destruction to the
extent such policy or announcement is less restrictive than
the terms of this Order.

9. Enron shall immediately post a copy of this
Order on Enron's intranet in such a way as to ensure that
this Order can be reviewed by all of Enron's officers,
directors and employees.

10. This Order shall be effective immediately

	i'm going to be out of the office tomorrow.  i'm still working on curing mcv for the month of march.  i will make sure chris is up to speed on the status
	of the curing process at the end of today.  here's where i stand as of 1:15pm today.  i spoked with tom moran regarding purchasing gas from anadarko and
	mid american.  he says both counterparties are ok.  i have checked with kay mann to make sure that mid american is still ok legally.  she saids 
	there has been no change with them in the last month.  i am planning on buying from mid american because the wire information is in place.  also,
	since we bought from them last month,  the scheduling contacts are in place.  i am waiting on doug sewell to give me the green light.  it is my
	intent to purchase the gas this afternoon and make the cash request.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

Mr. Fleck,


I write on behalf of my colleague Antonia Donohue.  You and her negotiated
a stipulation on or around May 15, 2002 between Enron and KeySpan Energy
Delivery-New England (Boston Gas) whereby Enron agreed to decide by May 25,
2002 whether to assume or reject an executory contract between Enron and
Boston Gas.  According to the stipulation, if Enron neither moved to assume
the contract or noticed its intention to reject the agreement by May 25,
2002, the contract would be deemed rejected.  It is my understanding that
Enron has not acted to assume or reject the Agreement within the agreed
upon time frame.   Please inform me whether this is correct.


Thanks,

Shemin,

As I mentioned yesterday, the attached file was requested by Steve Van Hooser. It contains the listing of transport contracts that we intend to reject. The file is not complete and I continue to add contracts as they are brought to my attention.

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

I had most of the details yesterday morning, my fault for not responding.  And I also didn't clue into the 4/99 contract start date as well.

With Rita and Kevin's help, we have identified 4 deals for American Public Energy Agency

Deal #		Contract	End Date	Pipeline		Comment
310424		96026367	4/30/2011	NNG		Did not receive any gas for December 2001
310690		96012204	5/31/2008	NNG		Did not receive any gas for December 2001
936073		96021055	4/30/2011	PGEN		Need to see when physical flow stopped
936263		96021053	4/30/2011	SCAL		Need to see when physical flow stopped.

Rita, you ran the Deal Volume Tracking report for Dec 2001 and you found the PGEN and SCAL deals.  Would you please run a report for Nov 2001 just to make sure that we have all the current deals?

Kevin, try to determine the last day ENA supplied these deals.

Thanks.

I'm out this afternoon.  Please call me on my cell phone of you have any questions.  My number is 713-557-5095.

Thanks.

Cornerstone has an ISDA which was terminated effective 11/28/01.  They have two outstanding invoices (possibly others that I am not aware of) in the amounts of $1,747,664.00  and $234,418.54.  Other outstanding invoices must be related to physical transactions.

Legal's termination log contains the following comment: "Cornerstone will make no further payments or delivery."

Hope this helps.

It looks like Cornerstone Propane, L.P. has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial.  Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of?

Neither of these companies have paid us for December 2001 gas.  MidAmerica is probably holding payment for forward value, I don't know about Cornerstone.  Both had invoices sent to them for December sales.  Attached is Cornerstone's SAP balance.  Call me if you need any further information.

To:  All US Domestic Employees
From:  Office of the Chief Executive

Earlier this week, we reached final resolution with the Creditors' Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies, or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy.  Later this morning, we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court.  It will be public and posted on the court's website, but we have posted the plan on <http://home.enron.com>.  (See link below).  Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan.  After that, the court may approve or modify it.  We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April.

We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors' Committee.  To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court, a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.  This plan meets that criterion.

We know all of you are interested in the plan's details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future.  To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work, we should first explain some near-term restructuring goals.

As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders, restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold, as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows.  We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy.  We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity.

This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate non-core assets or wind down the estate, as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business.  Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring, the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization.

The proposed plan is retroactive to March 1, 2002, and has a maximum value up to $130 million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections.  It includes the following components:
Severance benefits valued up to $7 million,
Retention payments valued at $40 million, and
Liquidation incentive pool, which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate, with a minimum value of $7.4 million and a maximum value of up to $90 million, one percent of the estate's cash collection target of $9 billion.

SEVERANCE BENEFITS
A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan.  Under the proposed plan, employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service, with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of $4,500.  If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause, he or she is not eligible for severance benefits.

Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees.  This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  The details of those plans have been shared with employees of non-debtor companies.

RETENTION
Under the proposed plan, retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely, or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring.  Regrettably, not all employees will receive retention.

An eligible employee's retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary.  At the beginning of each quarter, or three-month period, eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors.  The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period.

An employee participating in the retention program will receive 25 percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period, with payouts as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 75 percent of the earned retention for a period is non-vested, deferred, and will be paid to an employee after February 28, 2003.

If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February 28, 2003, an employee will receive all deferred retention, plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated.  Employees' earned and deferred retention payments are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention, with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received.  Depending on an employee's personal circumstances, a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated.

If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention.  He or she would not be eligible for severance.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL
Under the proposed plan, employees identified as critical to the sale of non-core assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool (LIP).  The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate.

Enron's management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each $500 million dollars is collected, also called a "collection milestone".  Fifty percent of an employee's earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached.  The remaining 50 percent of the earned liquidation incentive is non-vested and deferred.

If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter, but progress has been made, a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of $1.85 million.  Fifty percent of an employee's quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 50 percent of an earned advance will be non-vested and deferred, and will offset against future incentive payments.

All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events:
1.		Enron's reorganization is complete; or
2.	the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause, or
3.	upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections.

Employees' earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits.  If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

OTHER ITEMS
Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the 90-day period prior to its bankruptcy's filing.  To that end, creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate.  The Creditors' Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company, and stays with the company through August 31, 2002, or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause, whichever comes first.

All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits, deferred quarterly retention payments, or deferred liquidation payments.

We know how long you have waited for details about this plan.  We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week.  Although the Creditors' Committee has approved it, this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court.  Therefore, it is possible an employee's status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court.  Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan.

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

Nothing about bankruptcy is easy, and because of Enron's size, ours is especially complex.  So it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of Enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy.

To clarify, debtor-in-possession, or debtor, companies are the legal entities of Enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the Creditors' Committee and the bankruptcy court.  Non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by Enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part, non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual.  The estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of Enron, which include some holdings in non-debtor companies.  It is important to note that at the beginning of March there were approximately 20,000 Enron employees in non-debtor companies, and about 3,500 Enron employees in debtor companies.

Distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program.  As we work through restructuring, components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies.  For example, earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business.

Another example is severance.  Going forward, we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce.  Given the uncertainty of our situation, we realize the importance of providing a "safety net."  Severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future.  Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees.  This was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  While the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies, severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval.  Employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention.

Retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees, primarily those in debtor companies.  Retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity, to liquidate non-core assets, or to unwind the affairs of the estate.  Retention is not a measure of past performance, but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.

Additionally, we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies.  Supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees.

We hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses, but more importantly, we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees.

Stacy,
Chris has stated the the CP has agreed to pay and be liable for the GST. Any language handy that we can add on to the confirm (along with our Bankruptcy disclaimer of course) to cover this provision? Perhaps below or in the Pricing Language portion of the Confirmation?
Something: 
Goods and Services Tax ("GST") LIABILITY: Contract Price does not include GST. Buyer is liable for and shall pay, or cause to be paid, or reimburse Seller if Seller has paid, all fees applicable to GST.
 
Sitara Deal #1199439
 
Thanks!!!

Per my discussion with Dave Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.  We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me.  You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.
 
Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.  I did not discuss the GST tax, I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?

Robin,

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon.  We have not heard back yet.  We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc.  I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party.  Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations?  I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Thanks again for your help.

Christy

Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi.  The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

Robin,

How are you doing?  It has been a few years since we've seen each other.
John Fitzpatrick asked that I send to you the GISB contract for your review.
If you will complete the information on the right-hand side of the first

Let me know if you have any questions.

To:  Participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan
From:  Enron Benefits
Re:  Changes to the Savings Plan

Yesterday, the Enron Board of Directors met.  A press release outlining the Board's actions states:

" ... Enron believes that the total amount of the liquidated, undisputed claims against Enron and its subsidiaries exceeds and will exceed the current fair market value of the consolidated operations and assets of Enron and its subsidiaries.  Consequently, Enron believes that its existing equity does not and will not have value and that any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court will not provide Enron's existing equity with any interest in the reorganized debtor."

Essentially, this means that any holdings in Enron stock will carry no value as the company reorganizes.  Consequently, the Board also decided that employees participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan should no longer be able to invest contributions into Enron stock (Enron Corp. Stock Fund.)

IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS PLAN

Effective with the February 15, 2002 paycheck, employees who participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan will no longer be able to invest contributions directly into Enron stock.

If your investment election currently includes Enron stock, we strongly encourage you to review the other investment options available and revise your investment elections accordingly.  If you do not actively change your investment elections, any portion of your contribution still allocated to Enron stock will be redirected to Fidelity Freedom 2000, a money market fund, where your investment will remain until you take further action.

Within the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, there are a wide range of investment options to meet your individual investment goals and retirement needs.  Information on other available investment funds, including past performance, is available through the Savings Plan website.  You may elect to contribute to any of these funds in one percent increments.

You may change your investment choices at any time.  Changes are enacted the following business day.

To review and make changes to your investment elections online, visit  <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>.  To change investment elections via the website, access the "Change Future Investments" option from your main account screen.  To review and make changes to your investment elections by phone, call the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.  Follow the instructions to access your account.  Then, follow voice prompts to "Investment Options."  From there, select "Investment Elections" to make necessary changes.

TRANSFERRING FUNDS WITHIN YOUR SAVINGS PLAN ACCOUNT

This change in investment elections will not affect any existing balances in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund - it only effects future contributions to that fund.  Until March 14, 2002, you will still be able to transfer funds from other investments within the Savings Plan into the Enron Corp. Stock Fund.  However, as set forth in the press release quoted above, the board believes that holdings in Enron stock will carry no value as the company reorganizes.  Consequently, we strongly recommend that employees participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan no longer invest in Enron stock.  Effective March 15, 2002, transfers into the Enron Corp. Stock Fund will no longer be allowed from other investments within the Savings Plan.

If you participated in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), you may still elect to roll your ESOP shares directly into Enron stock within the Savings Plan.

At any time, you may transfer funds, including company-matching contributions, out of the Enron Corp. Stock Fund into any of the other investment options available within the Savings Plan.  To transfer funds online, visit <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron> and access the "Transfer Money" option from your main account screen.  To transfer funds by phone, listen for the prompts from the "Investment Options" to either "Fund Reallocation" or "Fund Transfer" to change your existing account balances.

As always, we encourage you to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

Subject:	Questions

Let me first apologize for this being so late.  I had to consult with Legal.  Below are the answers to the questions asked last week in Ed's staff meeting:

1.  Will the employees receive a sheet of paper telling them how much they will get?  At the time payouts are made employees should receive some sort of confirmation of what $ amount is paid and what $ amount is deferred.  The exact method of this communication is being worked out currently.  Amounts paid and confirmed will most likely be posted for employee reference on ehronline similar to our benefit programs.
2.  What is going on with the SEC?  With relation to the KERP program, the SEC had several questions they posed to Dan Leff, Steve Cooper and Robert Jones.  Their questions were answered efficiently, and as you all now know the KERP plan has been approved by the courts.
3.  Who is on the Management Committee?  At this time the Management Committee consists of the below listed:
Stephen Cooper*
Jeffrey McMahon*
Ray Bowen*
Stan Horton*
Jim Hughes*
Mike McConnell*
Scott Josey
Dan Leff*
Tim Detmering
Jeff Donahue
Mitch Taylor
Dick Lydecker
Cindy Olson
Mark Palmer
Greg Piper
Jordan Mintz
Rob Walls*
*Denotes Executive Management Committee
4.  Is the $1.85M quarterly floor payment in the LIP guaranteed?  Yes.
5.  Are the LIP quarterly floor payments forward or backward?  The LIP floor payments are quarterly payments that are off-settable to the milestone payments.  In other words, the LIP floor payments are paid on a draw in advance of us meeting the milestones.  The milestone payment would be off-set by any payment made under the quarterly floor requirement.

I hope this address your questions adequately.

Thanks-

Many of you have friends who are no longer with the company, so we wanted to provide you an overview of continuing efforts to assist Enron's former employees.

I started the process with Oxy to approve an agreement with ENA similar to the one with EES in December of 2001.  We should have it tomorrow morning, it can be signed and faxed to them and you will be able to do a deal.

We will get regular, hard copies of the agreement back via regular mail.

Post-petition monies cannot be set off against pre-petition, but if someone wants to send me the short paragraph you are using....we will incorporate it.  I am adding the necessary bankruptcy wording to the GISB.

Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi.  The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

John Fitzpatrick asked that I send to you the GISB contract for your review.
If you will complete the information on the right-hand side of the first

A couple of quick updates:

1. We are close to having our deal monitoring spreadsheet pulled together.  Kimberly Landry will coming to each of you to fill-in the appropriate info on your deals. This info will feed into the master EWS spreadsheet. This is intended to capture all assets (physical and contractual)  that are in the process of being sold or settled.  Only those deals that are active should be included.  Assets/contracts that are not in the process will not be included.

2.  Prior to anyone meeting with the BTRC regarding a potential transaction, Bob Semple (Zolfo/Copper's representative within EWS)  and Jim Fallon/Rich DiMichele MUST be consulted.  Additionally, it should go without saying that I should be familiar with those transactions going to the BTRC as well as the respective functional head Racicot-power/McMichael-gas/Zisman-assets (E&P is separate and should be managed through Melendrez). 

3. Any transitional services that we might require from UBS should be coordinated through Rich DiMichele in EWS.  Eddy Daniels has been appointed our sole point of contact within UBS.  All one-off inquires and requests into UBS should be eliminated.  Additionally, please remind all your employees that UBS is a separate company and is not entitled to any Enron related information.  There are reports of UBS employees calling Enron commercial people looking for information, copies of contracts, etc.  We are all prohibited from sharing any confidential information with anyone outside the company (UBS or others).

Thanks for your help and let me know if you all have any questions.

Don

Chip,

As you are aware, I met with Bob Semple this morning regarding the presenta=
tions being made before the BTRC.  Bob is of the view that these presentati=
ons are often too long and detailed for the entire BTRC audience and that t=
he presentation style/format should be modified slightly.  We agreed on the=
 following:  (1) the old presentations (which were generally several pages =
in length and contained more detailed information) should continue to be pr=
epared, (2) an "executive summary" should be prepared (on a single page) as=
 a cover sheet to the "old style" presentation, (3) the executive summary s=
hould be limited to the proposed transaction, associated economics and othe=
r highly pertinent information (such as ownership, debtor vs. non-debtor, t=
hird party liabilities, etc.) and (4) the actual presentation at the BTRC m=
eeting should be limited to the items reflected on the executive summary an=
d although the "old style" presentations should be distributed to BTRC part=
icipants (under cover of the executive summary), the information contained =
therein should not be discussed or referred to unless questions arise durin=
g the BTRC meeting that justify doing so.

If any of this is unclear (or if you have a principled objection to making =
this change), please give me a call.

Thanks

ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air.  

Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.

New Enron CEO turns company focus to future ; While workers cope with loss and uncertainty

HOUSTON -- Inside Enron headquarters, employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Post-it Notes from the empty desks of their laid-off co-workers. On one desk, an employee finds a note that reads: "I'm not gone, don't take my stuff!" 
Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns, Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost 18,000 employees who work on Enron's power plants and pipelines.
USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper, the new chief executive, talking about his vision for the future. 
On the 50th floor of executive suites, decorated with rich carpets and velvet-covered chairs, there is a sweeping view of Houston -- a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy, political donations and corporate muscle. Cooper, however, is only focused on saving part of the company. 
His plan faces monumental challenges. In his words, "Everybody's betting against us." 
While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the past year -- Kmart, Polaroid, Bethlehem Steel -- the size, speed and sordid details of Enron's collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits, angered creditors, demoralized employees and ruined its reputation. 
But Cooper -- whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid, Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores - - is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year. 
"I've probably been in more Chapter 11s than anybody in the United States, literally," he says. "This company, by way of business and asset base, by way of management team, by way of predictability of its future business, has more of all of that than most distressed businesses I've ever seen." 
Cooper's plans 
The company already has sold the energy-trading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg. Although a bankruptcy court and Enron's creditors must first approve any moves, Cooper's plans include: 
* Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a "more modest habitat," Cooper says. 
* The company's new $100 million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale. 
* Even Enron's name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go. 
"Out of the ashes, there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year, or two, or three from now," he says. 
Today, the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida. And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel. 
He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the company's businesses, including its broadband network, water utilities and the like. 
That will mean cutting an additional 10% to 20% off Enron's payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the 1980s. 
But to pull off his plan, Cooper must not only sway his critics, including giant Wall Street creditors, but also motivate thousands of devastated employees. 
"Cooper and (Enron President Jeff) McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated," says John Whitney, a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University. 
To lock in 500 key executives, Enron offered $55 million in retention bonuses. Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energy-trading business also pocketed multimillion-dollar payoffs. 
And Cooper's pay? 
The New York-based consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive $1.3 million a year, plus $1.2 million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston. If Enron emerges from bankruptcy, Cooper's firm will get a $5 million fee. If Enron is liquidated, Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
Shattered morale 
Enron's fall from grace has shattered employee morale. 
"It's just so sad," says one current employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "On several floors, it looks like the rapture. It looks like people disappeared into space. They're just gone." 
This employee, just two years away from retirement, watched $160,000 in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enron's stock price. "Now I'm going to have to work as a greeter at Wal-Mart until I'm 90," the employee says. "It's gone. I just can't make it back." 
Jorge Garcia, a project controls manager laid off in December, says his friends still at Enron say, " 'You can tell if you'll be let go soon by your office accommodations. If you've been moved to a cubicle, you probably won't last long.' " 
That kind of stress takes its toll. 
Downstairs in the company gym, Kathy Kissner, a massage therapist, says that as the company fell apart, employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments. 
"I've lost 30 pounds in the last six months" from long hours and lack of sleep, says Mark Palmer, vice president of communications. 
Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally. It's the hardest part of his job. 
"When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money, they often times get heated. They get emotional and upset," he says. "It's never fun to be at the receiving end, but I've gotten used to it." 
Blast voice mail 
To motivate the employees, he is trying to focus them on future goals. "People have two choices: We can spend all of our time living in the past, which is a crazy way to spend your life. You can't change it. Or, we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss, to focus on the future," he says. 
And he has opened up lines of communication. 
Once a week, he sends out a lengthy voice mail, telling employees what has happened during the past week, explaining management changes and timetables. 
When employees call or send him e-mail, he will go find them in the building to answer their questions. And next month, he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy. 
This kind of candid communication is essential, he says. 
"We are not trying to eliminate bad news. We are not trying to make it just good news. What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty," he says. "People can live with either one of those, good or bad. What they can't live with is uncertainty." 
And while some still say Enron's future is uncertain, Cooper is certain of one thing: 
"The lives and reputations of 20,000 people shouldn't be trash- canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild," he says. "People ought to keep in perspective that we've got a lot of really tremendous people here, and for the sake of a couple bad apples, we shouldn't blowtorch the entire field."

The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation: Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted, Stephen Cooper says.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down, according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper, the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency. 
Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid, although he declined to identify specific targets.
"Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate," said Cooper, a principal with Zolfo Cooper, a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. "I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later." 
The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play, and all are potential defendants. 
Enron filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees. The nation's seventh-largest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the off-the-books partnerships, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than 6,000 jobs. 
An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1 billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor, and Vinson & Elkins, one of its outside law firms. 
Still Sorting Out All the Issues 
Cooper, who occupies Skilling's old office on the 50th floor of Enron's mirrored office tower in downtown Houston, said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions. That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F. Glisan. 
"I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation," Cooper said. 
Cooper and his team are still "sorting out issues" related to Enron's financial statements and the value of its trading book, the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation. Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection, the value of those contracts has eroded to about $1 billion from about $7 billion. 
"I certainly don't believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that aren't completely above board," Cooper said. "We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements, which I believe, in the main, will be accurate." Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen, which it fired. 
Enron already has filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. alleging that its cross-town rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company. Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investment-grade credit rating. 
The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the market-dominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built. The name will change, and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plants--the kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained. 
Cooper's style, too, is unlike Lay's grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skilling's hard-driving image. Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office, complete with baseball cap. He hasn't decorated Skilling's wood-paneled, deadbolted office. 
To keep up employee morale, Cooper said he visits workers in response to e-mail and sends out weekly, unscripted voicemail updates. An all-employee meeting will be held soon, he said. 
Enron's overhaul is well underway. 
Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline, 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas, which was a condition of the $1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger. Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energy-trading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit. 
What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines, including one that runs from Texas to California, and electricity generating plants. Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General, its Oregon utility, as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company. 
Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because "we haven't settled on a final configuration yet. But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron. 
"The company, if you remove the trading from the rest of the business, it's actually got a very good, very solid, very revenue- and cash-flow- and earnings-predictable business, which is really its power and pipes business," Cooper said. "So in my view, there is an eminently reorganizable entity here." 
'Not Going to Wallow and Linger' 
Cooper expects to present "a fairly on-point direction" for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year. 
"We're going to move this process forward very quickly. We're not going to wallow and linger in Chapter 11 for a day longer than we have to." 
Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold, Cooper said he is "not of that mind," adding that in his 30-year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business. Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate, he said. 
Enron has a bit of that. Although it leases its Houston headquarters, Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door. It has received $40 million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project. 
Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a post-mortem on Enron, but he did acknowledge the "very labor-intensive" process of sorting through "hundreds upon hundreds" of so-called special purpose entities, which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the company's balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes, such as a sale and lease-back of a building. 
Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enron's liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle, he said. A team of about 10 Zolfo Cooper employees, an unusually large number, is being assigned to Enron, Cooper said. 
"There's a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not. Both of these are being looked at. We'll just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out," Cooper said. 
Special purpose entities "are not good or bad, they're just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business, to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business," Cooper said. 
"The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk [from Enron to the partnerships] and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties" by working for both Enron and the partnerships, he said. 
"What we saw here was a case where they weren't constructed properly, they weren't reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction, you couldn't have really an arm's-length transaction. It's kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement." 
Despite its size, the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled, Cooper said. Those included Federated Department Stores Inc., Polaroid Corp. and Malden Mills. 
Unique to Enron, however, is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business, Cooper said. 
"It's become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company, but it's become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests" involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance, Cooper said. 
"I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies, a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees," Cooper said. 
"It's sort of like when your car breaks down and you're in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car. You're kicking the tires. You're kicking the bumpers. After you get over it, you realize that it's still a good car. You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going."

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Chris,
 
So do I pay the invoice or not.  I'm a little confused from all the emails.  Please advise.  Thanks.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.
Lynn

Give me your fax number and I'll fax it over.  Doug Sewell said he would not pay for it as ENA and I don't know enough about the deal to argue with him.  I've pasted in Richard's response is in black below.

I'm familar with the item. It sounds like enovate should pay it if it is enovate access. 
Is this taken care of or do I need to call someone to pay it?  Let me know 
Richard

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?
Thanks

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Re:  Management Changes

As a company working to emerge from bankruptcy, Enron looks and feels completely different.  However, one thing is the same - we continue to move and change at a fast pace.  Last week, we shared with you a developing management team.  This week, we want to update you on some further management changes that have taken shape.

Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel, will retire from Enron effective March 1, 2002.

Rob Walls, currently deputy general counsel, will succeed Derrick and serve immediately as acting general counsel.

We are also happy to announce that Mike McConnell, formerly CEO of Enron Global Markets, is returning to the company to help identify and develop business opportunities within our remaining non-regulated businesses.

We will continue to share changes to the management team as they occur.

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

Drew, 
 
I need to send out a payment of about $2.1 million next Tuesday to Reliant.  The price is based off the NYMEX settle for today which we won't know until after 3:00 PM.  And I prefer to wait until the day after NYMEX settles so I can see the price in a published document like Gas Daily.  This puts us in a bit of a bind.  

What I can do is prepare the cash request form today based off the NYMEX settle, that means you won't get it from me until after 3:30 PM.  Monday morning I will verify the price in print, and get the signed wire request to you before 10:00 AM assuming Margaret, Ed, and Susan are all available to sign it.  Phil already has an estimate for these amounts on the Gas Cash Forcast worksheet.

Let me know if this works for you.

Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.  

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

Thanks

	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Re:  Management Changes

With Steve Cooper's appointment as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer, we have begun to focus on the future of Enron and require a management team committed to doing the same.

While certain roles and responsibilities are still being defined, we wanted to share with you some greater detail regarding the company's organizational structure and management team.  The management team is not complete, but currently includes:

?	Stan Horton will continue to manage our pipeline and global asset businesses, including Portland General Electric.  Jim Hughes, reporting to Stan, oversees our international assets.  Peggy Fowler, also reporting to Stan, oversees PGE.

?	Scott Josey oversees our domestic oil and gas exploration and production business, which includes Mariner as well as other North American properties currently held by the wholesale division.

?	Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will manage the liquidation and sale of the Wholesale and Retail trading books.  Jim Fallon and Dan Leff will report to Bob.

?	Mark Muller continues to oversee corporate development activities and will manage all asset sales for Enron going forward.

?	Jordan Mintz will manage the tax department worldwide.

?	Dick Lydecker, reporting to Ray Bowen, will oversee Enron's accounting function.

?	Cindy Olson directs Human Resources, Employee Relations, and Property Services.

?	Mark Palmer continues to manage Public Relations.

?	Greg Piper is the chief information officer for Enron.

Once Enron's management team is completely assembled and we begin to finalize the plan to restructure the company, we will be better able to communicate greater detail about the organization's structure and how each of you will contribute to it.  We appreciate your patience as we work through this challenging, but worthwhile process.

Our last physical volumes from Wiser was March 2000.
Our last physical volumes from Riceland was July 2001.

KLJ is a producer on Gatherco which flows into Columbia Gas.  Our last month to receive gas from KLJ was November 2001.  We don't know if they have sent Enron a termination letter or not but I do have a deal with KLJ in Sitara (#250668) that goes through Oct 31, 2002.



Wade Price notes:
Germany, Chris says:
k.l.j., Inc is a gather co supplier, do you know if they have terminated their contract with us?
Price, Wade R. says:
I don't know that we received a termination notice from KLJ in the Settlements shop.  No gas was allocated for KLJ from Gatherco from Dec-01 forward.  Riceland has nothing in Unify since July-01 and Wiser has notheing since May-00.
Germany, Chris says:
cool, so all 3 of these are Appalachian producers then correct?
Price, Wade R. says:
KLJ-yes.  Riceland - No (ANR pipe), Wiser - on CGAS (Mar-00 not May), but production was 139000dth, more than a normal appalachian metered production.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

EA Estate Group:

Please see the below reference of Enron's vacation eligibility, allowance, and scheduling policy:

Vacation Eligibility:
All regular full-time employees are eligible for vacation based on continuous service.  Regular part-time employees receive 40 hours per year of paid vacation per year.  Temporary employees are not eligible for vacation.

Vacation Allowance:
Vacation allowance is based on an employee's continuous service according to the following schedule.  Employees must be on the payroll and actively at work as of the first business day of the calendar month to accrue vacation for that month.  If the first day of the month falls on a holiday or weekend, causing the employee to have a hire date other than the first, the vacation accrual date will be dated the first of the month so that the employee will accrue vacation for the month.  (For example, an employee with a hire date of January 5, 1998 will have a vacation accrual date of January 1, 1998.  The intent of this change is only to affect the vacation accrual date as explained; it is not to affect any other term, condition, privilege, or benefit of employment.)

Length of Continuous Service--Vacation Allowed
>From hire date to the end of the calendar year in which the employee was hired -- Prorated accrual of 10 hours per month for each full calendar month completed.
For an employee hired in a prior calendar year who has less than 10 years of service -- 3 weeks (120 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 10 but less than 20 years of service -- 4 weeks (160 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 20 years of service -- 5 weeks (200 hours) per year
Vacation may be taken any time in the calendar year in which the employee will complete required service for 3 weeks, 4 weeks, or 5 weeks of vacation, per the schedule above, except for the hire year.

Vacation Scheduling and Approval:
Supervisors- The supervisor will develop a vacation schedule that ensures all essential operations are maintained effectively.  All vacation requests are subject to Supervisor approval.  

Tthe Estate will continue to implement its current policy with respect to the payment of unused vacation under most circumstances.  Any questions regarding this policy should be addressed to Khymberly Booth @ X52532.

Thanks-
ENA Human Resources

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows:

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

Steve Menke said you would know the answer. 

I purchased capacity from Steve last October.  The terms were as follows; 
Release Date    11/1/2001 through 3/31/2002 
Volume          18,000 dth 
Contract        T0181230000 
Offer           #200110000095 

Steve said he thought they recalled this capacity.  Would you see if it was recalled and if it was, what was the effective date of the recall.

Thanks

This message is being sent on behalf of Robert Jones.

 
This letter confirms that you have been selected to participate in Enron's Liquidation Incentive Pool (LIP) program.  The LIP program is part of the company's court-approved retention plan and is specifically designed to recognize employee contributions toward the successful liquidation of non-core businesses from the Enron estate.

Your supervisor has shared with you a projected LIP participation target.  If you wish to confirm your projected target, feel free to contact your Human Resource representative.

The amount of money placed into and dispersed from the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate.  Therefore, cash collections as well as individual contributions to the liquidation process could adjust, upward or downward, the actual LIP payouts to participating employees.

A Compensation Committee, made up of senior managers, will have discretion to recommend incentive amounts for participants in the liquidation pool after each $500 million is collected, also called a "collection milestone".  The Compensation Committee's recommendations must be approved by the members of the Office of the Chief Executive and the Management Committee and are subject to review by Ernst & Young and the court approved examiner for Enron North America.

Cash collections will be monitored through a weekly dashboard and you will be provided regular status updates.  Members of the Office of the Chief Executive, the Management Committee, and the Compensation Committee will validate the date a collection milestone is reached.

Fifty percent of your earned liquidation incentive for the collection period will be distributed as soon as practical after a milestone is reached.

The remaining 50 percent of the earned liquidation incentive or any quarterly advance payment is non-vested and deferred.  The length of the deferral period varies depending on the collection milestone in which it is earned.

Accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events:
1.	upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections:
a.	12 months after each incremental $500 million milestone up to the first $3 billion,
b.	nine months after each incremental $500 million milestone up to the second $3 billion, and
c.	six months after each incremental $500 million milestone up to or beyond the third $3 billion.
2.	the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause, or
3.	Enron's reorganization is complete; or

If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter, but progress has been made, a quarterly advance may be allocated to you based on a quarterly floor amount of $1.85 million.  Fifty percent of a quarterly advance will be paid to you as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 50 percent of an earned advance will be non-vested and deferred, and will offset against future incentive payments.

If you are an active employee on the validated milestone date, you are eligible to earn a LIP payment based on your contributions toward the milestone.  As a participant in the liquidation incentive pool, you are not eligible for severance benefits.

Your supervisor will communicate your actual incentive amount after a collection milestone is reached or at the end of the quarter and project targets for the next collection milestone or upcoming quarter.  These face-to-face meetings will be part of a broader performance assessment process designed to track individual accomplishments for the benefit of the employee, the company and the creditors' committee.

Thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to Enron.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

I know you all received the below e-mail, however I wanted to encourage you to talk to your employees regarding this to ensure everyone understands the importance of getting this in on time.  If it is not in the box on 16 by Monday end of business (5:00) there is a chance the employee may not receive their KERP payment at the time of others.  This form has to be received by HR for payment to be made.  If you have any employees who will be unable to comply with this please let me know.  

Portland and San Francisco-  I will contact you to let you know what to do to get these in on time.

Thanks-

The Bankruptcy Court order authorizing the Key Employee Retention, Liquidation Incentive and Severance Plan (the "KERP") requires that, before receiving any payment under the KERP, each participant certify that he or she has not engaged in insider trading of the Company's stock.  To receive any KERP payment, you must print, complete, and return the attached certificate. 
   

If you wish to review Enron's policy regarding insider trading, you can find the Securities Trades by Company Personnel section of the Code of Ethics at: 

<<http://home.enron.com/resources/policies/code_of_ethics/code_of_ethics100600.pdf >>

  

We are making every effort to make the first payments under the KERP by June 15, 2002.  To ensure that you receive your first scheduled payment on June 15th with your regularly scheduled pay via direct deposit, you should:
   
?	Completely and legibly fill out the form.
?	 Deliver it to the designated receptacle in the lobby on the 16th floor by  no later than 5:00 p.m., Monday, June 3, 2002.
?	 Do not drop it in the mail.

Unfortunately, late forms will result in a delay in payment.  Thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to Enron.

Chris,

If you send me an email this afternoon with the estimated amount (I assume it will be $2.1MM) and the net benefit/(cost) to the estate, I will add the amount to the summary for discussion with the Cash Committee on Monday.  If we get the request signed on Monday we should have no problem sending the wire on Tuesday as long as Larry Cash reserves the cash for Tuesday.

Drew, 
 
I need to send out a payment of about $2.1 million next Tuesday to Reliant.  The price is based off the NYMEX settle for today which we won't know until after 3:00 PM.  And I prefer to wait until the day after NYMEX settles so I can see the price in a published document like Gas Daily.  This puts us in a bit of a bind.  

What I can do is prepare the cash request form today based off the NYMEX settle, that means you won't get it from me until after 3:30 PM.  Monday morning I will verify the price in print, and get the signed wire request to you before 10:00 AM assuming Margaret, Ed, and Susan are all available to sign it.  Phil already has an estimate for these amounts on the Gas Cash Forcast worksheet.

Let me know if this works for you.

Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.  

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

Attached is a copy of a sample letter which we are sending to selected vendors of Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries as an additional step toward implementing our commitment to conduct our business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business Ethics Policy.

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to an Enron work environment of which we can all be proud.

Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. ("Enron") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
