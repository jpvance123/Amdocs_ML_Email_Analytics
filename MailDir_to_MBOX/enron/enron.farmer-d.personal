Subject: FW: A&M and ESPN 
For Immediate Release 
June 26, 2001 
ESPN TO LAUNCH SIDELINES NETWORK'S SECOND REALITY-BASED SERIES TO 
PREMIERE WITH TEXAS A&M FOOTBALL 
ESPN will launch a 13-episode, prime-time series this fall entitled 
Sidelines, the network's second reality-based title under the ESPN 
Original 
Entertainment  (EOE) banner.  Sidelines will document the season of a 
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible, 
less 
celebrated people who are involved with the team.  The football Aggies 
of 
Texas A&M will be the focus of the series' premiere episodes to begin 
October 5. 
"Coach Slocum and I made the decision to be a part of this exciting 
venture 
with ESPN," Texas A&M Athletics Director Wally Groff said.  "We couldn't 
be 
more thrilled that ESPN has chosen Texas A&M for this series.  The 
opportunity ESPN gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all 
of 
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up." 
In a "docu-drama" style, the various stories that surround the team will 
be 
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day-to-day lives 
are 
directly affected by living in the town and/or going to the school. 
Players 
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral 
fashion, but will not be the primary focus. 
"This is a good opportunity for Texas A&M University and we're delighted 
ESPN decided to feature the football program and some of the people 
behind 
the scenes," Head Coach R.C. Slocum said. "We look forward to working 
with 
them." 
The participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who 
reflect 
every aspect of the University and College Station, Texas.  They will be 
students, faculty, media, local storeowners, mothers, fathers and some 
of 
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the University. 
"Each person has a role to play with the team, as well as a personal 
story," 
said Mark Shapiro, vice president and general manager, ESPN Original 
Entertainment.  "Sidelines will see each person grow in character as the 
season progresses -- a kind of 'soap-umentary.' We'll weave the smaller 
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression 
and 
fate of the team and its season." 
SIDELINES: TEXAS A&M STORYLINES 
--This is the 125th anniversary of the school's founding (1876). 
--The community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire 
collapse 
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago.  A 90-year 
tradition came to a tumultuous end.  Dealing with the loss and the 
emotional 
toll it took on faculty members, students and families will be an 
important 
part of this series.  The bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a 
different form than has been tradition. 
--Texas A&M, who lost a wild, snowy Independence Bowl last year in 
overtime 
to Mississippi State 43-41, will play Notre Dame (at home), Texas, 
Oklahoma, 
Kansas St and Colorado next year.  A tough schedule will provide for 
great 
drama. 
--The school invented the phrase "12th Man" and actually owns the 
trademark. 
One game, the Aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and 
stand 
ready just in case he was needed. Ever since, a student is chosen for 
every 
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team. 
--Billy Pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities. He's been at 
the 
University for 36 years and was the student trainer for Bear Bryant's 
A&M 
team. He was actually in Junction, Texas for Bryant's infamous grueling 
summer camp. The story of it was a best-selling book, The Junction Boys. 
--At midnight on the Friday night before every home game, A&M students 
gather at the stadium for what is called "Midnight Yell Practice;" 
30,000 
fans show up each week for this time-honored tradition. 
EOE, the newest franchise of ESPN Programming, will develop a 
wide-variety 
of branded programming outside of the network's traditional event and 
sports 
news genres. Using a collection of vehicles -- game shows, documentaries 
or 
reality-based shows - it's ESPN's goal to broaden its audience by 
appealing 
to younger and casual sports fans.  In addition, the company is 
exploring 
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all 
platforms of the ESPN family - television, Internet, radio

Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy's sugar levels are staying up 
pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took a shot last night 
& I guess she didn't eat enough ice cream.  She was mad at me cause I didn't 
give her more than I did.  But it's so hard to know exactly how to handle it 
'cause she's been going to bed a little high & getting up a little high.  But 
anyway, she's doing better & I guess she'll always be mad & think I'm 
mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not knowing if she got low 
after I left & passed out & no one would know it.  I'm going to try to get a 
cell phone & have her call me when she gets there--I think--I don't 
know--she'll be mad about that too.  But the other night, she didn't eat 
right after she took her shot, then didn't eat anything fast acting & got in 
the truck to go over to Phillip's to get research info from his computer, got 
low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs.  So that's what scares me.  She knew 
to eat righ!
t after she took that shot & didn't. But she was high before she took it & I 
guess she didn't think about it getting low. I don't know what will happen to 
her when she leaves home.

But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we're going to Dallas to look for 
the prom dress & shoes, don't know if we will stay all night or not. I 
haven't talked to Shane & Shelley.  I wanted to stay & go to Saturn Rd. to 
church & go to the singles class.  But I don't know what Shane & Shelley have 
planned.  So we'll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to 
work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once.  So, wish us 
luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they're more than I was 
expecting. But anyway, I don't intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will be 
some sales.
Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got 
back home Sunday. Hug them for me & tell Cole that Mimi can't wait to see his 
bunkbeds. Love ya'll

Hi,

I figured something must be occupying your time other than answering 
non-business e-mail.

You guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each. ---- 
right? (chuckle).

If Tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have 
the time; lunch would be great. Just give me a call. Only if all the ifs 
really allow you the time.

Is Craig ok?? I hope.

I would be glad to help with your sprinkler system. My sharpshooter is older 
than you are, but I imagine it is built a little better. My requested wages 
for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you. I 
would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer. That would be 
free of charge.

I'm having a cable modem installed Monday. Supposed to be 50-70 times faster 
than what I have. I do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem. 
I can then dump my other phone line. Actually will end up spending less for 
more speed. I love technology.

Thanks for the info on the stock option. That is the closing price as of 
1/18/00, which is right before the jump. very nice of management. I like to 
know the number to see what might be affecting the price.

Well good luck on the extra job and give our best to Tonya ---- Not much 
longer to go...........

Ken

This is a statement that was read over the PA system at the football game
at Roane County High School, Kingston, Tennessee by school Principal Jody
McLoud, on September 1, 2000. I thought it was worth sharing with the
world, and hope you will forward it to all your friends. It clearly shows
just how far this country has gone in the wrong  direction.

"It has always been the custom at Roane County High School football games
to say a prayer and play the National Anthem to honor God and Country.

Due to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court, I am told that saying a prayer
is a violation of Federal Case Law.

As I understand the law at this time, I can use this public facility to
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle, and if
someone is offended, that's OK.

I can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and
calling it safe  sex. If someone is offended, that's OK.

I can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control. If someone is offended, no
problem.

I can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in
activities to  religiously worship and praise the goddess, mother earth,
and call it ecology.

I can use literature, videos and presentations in the classroom that depict
people with strong, traditional Christian convictions as simple minded and
ignorant and call it enlightenment.

However, if anyone uses this facility to honor God and ask Him to bless
this event with safety and good sportsmanship, Federal Case Law is
violated.

This appears to be inconsistent at best, and at worst, diabolical.
Apparently, we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except God and
His Commandments.

Nevertheless, as a school principal, I frequently ask staff and students to
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree. For me to do otherwise
would be inconsistent at best, and at worst, hypocritical. I suffer from
that affliction enough unintentionally. I certainly do not need to add an
intentional transgression.

For this reason, I shall, "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's," and
refrain from  praying at this time. However, if you feel inspired to honor,
praise and thank God, and ask Him in the name of Jesus to bless this event,
please feel free to do so. As far as I know, that's not against the law-
yet."

AND...one by one, the people in the stands bowed their heads, held hands
with one another, and began to pray. They prayed in the stands. They prayed
in the team huddles. They prayed at the concession stand. And they prayed
in the announcer's box. The only place they didn't pray was in the Supreme
Court of the United States of America - the seat of "justice" in the one
nation under God.

Somehow, Kingston, Tennessee, remembered what so many have forgotten... we
are given the Freedom OF Religion, not the Freedom FROM Religion.

Praise God that His remnant remains!

Let's Celebrate Jesus in 2001

Jesus said, "if you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my
Father."

---------

If you are not ashamed, Pass this on . . . but only if you mean it.

Yes, I do Love God. He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. Without
him, I am nothing but with Him, I can do all things through Christ that
strengthens me. Phil 4:13

What do you think about creating and maintaining an e mail address that will

Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)

I can not begin to express my heart filled "THANKS"  for all of the time and 
effort that everyone put into this successful Y2K effort.  It was truly great 
to see everyone working together to ensure that ENRON continues in it winning 
way by being the best at what we do.  I was truly blessed with the group of 
individuals listed above and their staffs that put the heart and soul into 
this process.  We have an outstanding team of individuals who in my opinion 
will always go the extra mile for ENRON..   Again, Thanks everyone you have a 
lot to be proud - " We successfully survived the Y2K event !!!"

Daren,
 
Now what? I see Ken is back and Jeff is  out. What a development. Jeff has a lot of his bud's in high places. Could be  many changes on the horizon.
 
How you doing? Moved to new building yet?  I'll be looking for my tour invitation.
 
How's the kids, wife, and home (read that  work project)?
 
Jen is home for a couple of weeks before  heading back to Waco. We are going up there to tour the new Law school (built  with tobacco settlement money -- so we feel like contributators). She has four  quarters down and 5 maybe 6 to go.
 
Son still in Florida. We plan to run over  there in September for a few days. Maybe do Disneyworld.
 
Jeni is supposed to get us tickets to the  Nebraska game in Waco this year. That should be fun. Speaking of football, I see  one Texas team high in the polls. The other???????
 
I got a new toy the other day. Sears had  a good sale on a power washer I've had my eye on, so I bought it. Just did the  patio and deck. God, I thought painting was mindless  work.....................
Also, found out from insurance company  they will be funding an entirely new roof (hail damage???). I don't like the  mess from that project but as old roof was a layover the old shake shingles I  will be glad to get rid of that and get decking down on roof.   
 
Know you are busy. Let me know the latest  when you have time.
 
Later,
Ken

is it possible that his first name show as "J Darren" ?   Daren is his middle 
name and the name that everyone addresses him by.    
We would also be glad to submit the change in SAP if the system will accept J 
Darren as the first name.
Please advise.

--------------------

WELCOME TO THE eXPATRIATE ZONE

Welcome to the "First" Issue of "The eXPATRIATE ZONE," the official
newsletter of the new "eXpatriate ZONE" web site. After publishing "The
Temperate Zone" for the past two years, I'm taking the opportunity to join
forces with Bob Segel who has been publishing "The Coconut Modem" with Karen
Coyne since April of 1994.

Last year, after operating in AOL exclusively, Bob created "Parrotkey.com"
out on the "Internet" where it would join it's sister site on AOL and be
accessible to all Parrot Heads. At the time Bob expanded "PK," we had been
working on my little area of "Club St. Somewhere," and the new
"Parrotkey.com" seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the Club.

While we were talking about the direction we wanted to see "Club St.
Somewhere" and "Parrot Key" go, we could see that this was the perfect chance
to, as Emeril says, "Kick it Up a Notch."
Jimmy Buffett's music was a big part of our lives, but even more so was the
"Expatriate Lifestyle" he sang about. A lifestyle that includes tropical
travel, sailing, boating, parasailing and surfing, and yes, the music and
lyrics of Mr. James W. Buffett.

So it is, that we created our new web site, "The eXPATRIATE ZONE"
<http://www.expatriatezone.com>, along with this newsletter of that same
name. In December, "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" opened its doors with its "Island
Trading Post" with its Holiday Shopping Service at the "Island Trading Post."
Over 3,600 people visited the site the first day, and daily prizes were
awarded for the first two weeks. The "Island Trading Post" will open again
soon, offering a complete line of tropical items, not just to those of us
that live a few blocks from Wal-Mart, but also for those of us lucky enough
to be on a sailboat or living on an island. For not, we'll start with the
"T-shirt of the Month." <http://www.eXpatriateZONE.com/islandstore>
We want "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" to not only keep you entertained and informed
while you toil away at your everyday "Corporate Gig," but it will also get
you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into "The
eXPATRIATE ZONE."

We hope you all enjoy our new effort, and also continue to visit "Parrot Key"
and "Club St. Somewhere." Both of which will be closely associated with "The
eXPATRIATE ZONE" and "Parrotkey.com."

Jackson & Bob

"EXPATRIATE OF THE MONTH"
JAMES "SUNNY JIM" WHITE

When I first ventured on the Internet in 1995, I ran in to a guy named "Sunny
Jim" who was living down in the Cayman Islands. We never really got a chance
to connect, for which I am truly sorry. But, when something is supposed to
happen, it usually does.

On the first leg of my "Road Dawg" Tour <http://parrotkey.com/stsomewhere>
(click on "Road Dawg") I stayed with my good friend Alex & Janet Leist and
their wonderful children. Over the five days I stayed at their house, Alex
and I listened to a lot of music, and one of the guys we both liked was
"Sunny Jim." I bought one of James' CDs from Alex, and fell in love with it
immediately. The CD was his second, called "Life in the Laid Back Lane."

Little did I know that I would meet up with James and his roady "Shady Floyd"
several times over the next six months. James was embarking on his first real
tour of the US since he moved "down island" almost twelve years ago. We got
several chances to talk over the summer, and we will have an in depth article
about this "Expatriate" soon on "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" web site. Be sure to
watch for it.

In the meantime, here are a couple of quick things I learned about this great
musician. When I asked him about his "Expatriate" status, his reply was,
"Technically, an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country,
for whatever reason. For some it's legal reasons, others just because they
want to, or that's where the work is. I have been an expatriate for nearly
twelve years now. I have pretty fully lived the whole Caribbean experience,
from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing, to sailing, scuba diving,
hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying
palms."

Even as James is about to repatriate himself and his family, I ask if there
were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate? "Maybe
somewhere on the coast of Mexico or in a group of islands that are all within
sailing distance of one another," was the advice he gave.

Until we can learn more of "Sunny Jim's" world, stop by his web site at
<http://sunnyjim.com> and if you don't have one of his CDs, Including his
latest release "Sandbar Serenade," for goodness sake, pick one up. You can
also read a great interview Alex conducted with James at
<http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/LooneyMon/interviews/sunnyjim.htm>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------

TRAVEL INTO "THE ZONE"
"Some are running from the IRS"

We strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens
and out into the real world as often as we can. Does this mean we give up one
our most useful tools of communication, computers? Heck no! With laptops,
cell phones and GPS systems, we can go anywhere, and still stay in touch if
we feel the need. But get real and throw that "Pager" away as soon as you can.

We hope to keep this section current and informative, hopefully hearing from
those of you already living your lives in "The Zone," helping the rest of us
prepare for our getaway from the cities. I'm sure there are some of us that
are preparing to "disappear" to places like Costa Rica, where the "The
eXPATRIATE ZONE" will become an important tool.

How would you like to check out a place to "disappear" to and write it off
your taxes at the same time? Want to go down into "The Zone" to places like
the Bahamas, Belize, St. Croix, Puerto Rico, Bonaire, the Dominica Republic
or Saba? Want to do something for the planet, work with dolphins, save a
coral reef, or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time?

Well we have the answer. Check out these organization's Web Sites, and then
get some advice from your financial advisor on 501C non-profit organizations.
Depending on the tax bracket you're in, Uncle Sam could end up paying for up
to half the trip.

The Oceanic Society <http://www.oceanic-societ.org>
Earthwatch Institute    <http://www.earthwatch.org>
REEF, The Reef Environmental Education Foundation   <http://www.reef.org>

After that, all that's left is to make that plane reservation, and remember,
"No Plane on Sunday."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------

"jimmyDOTcom"

After many delays, "jimmyDOTcom" has finally gone to the printer with a due
date of the middle of April. I hit some "bumps in the road" on my way to
publishing the first ever book about the Parrot Head Phenomena, but it was
all worth it.

This book isn't about Jimmy Buffett, it's about the effect of the Internet on
Parrot Heads. For more information, visit <http://www.jimmyDOTcom.com>. We
have a complete outline of the book, reviews from other Parrot Heads, and
samples of the pages on the site.

Financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1,000 copies at
the present time, so if your even thinking of buying a book, I suggest you
reserve your copy by putting your name on the "Reservation List." You will be
under no financial obligation. It will simply indicate to my financial
partners (who aren't Parrot Heads), just how many books we need to print. Do
it right away, because pre-sales were brisk, and if enough of you reserve a
copy, I can get the financing to expand the first printing.

Let's show the world what Parrot Heads stand for by making this book a big
success. When I was on the BHOTM Tour this summer, I had many people tell me
they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss. They wanted the boss
to understand why getting the day off for a Buffett Concert is so important.
Maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends "that
just don't get it."

Here's one of the latest reviews of the book from Bob Robinson, Founder &
President of the Sandlapper PHC in South Carolina. I had a great time with
this club on the "Road Dawg" Tour, and shared an advance copy with his club:

"When we received Jackson's plea for pictures, our members were blown away.
We hustled up a package of pix, as did a majority of the Parrot Head clubs
from around the globe, and the result is pure Parrothedonistic pleasure. This
collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time. If moderation is
your key to life then stay away from JimmyDotCom, 'cause this book is packed
with those stories only we can tell.  Congratulations BubbaFreak!"

CLUB TRINI UPDATE

Speaking of expatriates, how about the guys who play the true music of "The
Zone?" Club Trini's long awaited Live CD will finally be coming out this
April, one year after it's recording. Jimmy has been keeping Mike and Robert
pretty busy, so it's understandable that it took awhile. It will be the third
in the "Margaritaville Cafe - Late Nite" series. I can't wait to hear it, as
my wife and I were some of the lucky ones who were in New Orleans when it was
recorded.

You can get a look at all the songs included on the new CD at Club Trini's
revamped web site at <http://clubtrini.com>. Along with the great songs we've
become accustomed to, are a few I'm pretty excited about. If you haven't
heard CT's version of "African Friend" you're in for a real treat. Along with
that, is a song that Tina and Nadirah have been treating audiences to this
past summer, "Cario" and Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry."

At the new web site, fans can "now" order their favorite Club Trini CDs using
their credit cards. So there's no excuse to not owning everything available.
I think a true "Expatriate Musical Library" is incomplete without Club Trini.

This summer, Helen Hiatt, Jimmy and The Coral Reefer's Wardrobe Designer,
came up with a shirt that Club Trini members lovingly call the "Ice Cream
Vendor" shirt, which they wear out front at the start of the concert. OK,
Pete sometimes forgets his, and when he does have it on, it lost it's sleeves
somewhere along the way. There's a great design that has been applied to a
T-shirt that we all can own. Check it out at their site.

JESTERS AND FRIENDS
NOTE CARD SERIES

Tro-Pics <http://Tro-pics.com> has just released their first Note Cards
Series from their "Jesters and Friends" Original Oils. Friends, places and
musicians from past years have inspired these cards and Parrot Heads and
Expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times
when an email just isn't personal enough.

The Original Artwork is also on sale at this site, so be sure to stop by and
visit them. Included in the "Jesters" Series are our good Friends Tim Glancey
and Wally Nickel.

MILLENNIUM CHANGE BUBBA STYLE

I've got to tell you, I wasn't buying into this "New Millennium" thing, one
bit. In fact, I had almost decided not to go to the Buffett New Year's Eve
Show. Nothing to do with Jimmy, but I just didn't get the whole hype. But at
the last minute, I had a change of heart.

And now after being a special guest at Seagram's Party honoring the new
Margaritaville Tequila, I'm sure glad I went. The shows kind of melded
together for me, making the Millennium change over very special.

If you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both, visit our
new "The eXPATRIATE ZONE" web site at  <http://expatriatezone.com> and go to
the web version of this newsletter.

FLASH!!!  "EXPATRIATED PHANS" SPOTTED SOUTH OF THE BORDER

After making both of "Tropo Travel's" previous trips down to Cobo San Lucas,
Mexico, I had to miss this year's trek due to my being with the "Beach House
on the Moon" Tour on it's Florida, New Orleans and Houston swing.

As the story goes, those bad boys and girls from "The Expatriated Phan Club"
<http://u1lvcm.com/gst/expat> showed up again, mainly for the T-shirts that
said, "Too Much Tequila...Or Not Quite Enough" on the back. Who are those
people anyway? Whenever I go to their web site, all of them have black bars
covering their eyes. If you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for
"Down to the Banana Republics - 2000" visit <http://tropotravel.com >Mike
Mclain also has some other great trips planned this year, check them out.

Speaking of "Tropo Travel," if you need a hotel room for the Vegas or Irvine
Shows and want a great deal, visit there site for some great rates. I'm
joining some of my Parrot Head friends at the "Key Largo," though I'm kind of
afraid to be in a town like Vegas with Sue and Ponch Aprea from the Detroit
PHC. I'm joining a lot of my other friends I met on the road there too. I
hate seeing Jimmy in Vegas, but I've got to keep the streak alive, and seeing
all my Parrot Head friends will make it all worthwhile. I hope Peter Mayer
ends up playing there again this year.

And speaking of those great T-shirts, we have some neat shirts available at
the "Island Store." They're similar to the shirt you got if you went on this
year's trip, except they have "Tropo Travel's" seaplane on the back and the 
"No Bad Days" logo on the front breast. You can see a picture at
<http://www.eXpatriateZONE.com/islandstore>.

PARROTHEAD PILOTS ASSOCIATION

Here are a couple of tidbits for your "Airplane Nuts" and pilots out there.

A new online friend who's a Medivac Chopper Pilot is trying to start a Parrot
Head's Pilot's Association. If you're interested, contact Dan at
<Medcopter1@aol.com>.

I also ran across a really cool page that features Jimmy's "Hemisphere
Dancer" including it's "Jamaican Bullet Hole." Ed Booth, Jr. an attorney from
Jacksonville, Florida, who belongs to "Lawyer-Pilots Bar Association" is the
webmaster and creator.

The web site is "GRUMMAN N928J" (Flashback - How many of you remember the TV
Show 'Whirly Birds'? Wasn't their number N975B?) and is at
<http://lpba.org/buffett.html>  It shows a lot of pictures of Jimmy's 1954
Grumman I think you'll enjoy.

Now all we need is for these guys to team up with the Parrot Heads Pilot's
Association.

Well, this season we lost Mick and O'Neal and picked up Daren and Plove. I guess I'll be on the court more to utilize my quickness since we lost a couple of guards.  We have a buy next week to open the season.

Here's a video of the three and four year old kids singing at the Christmas
program at church last year.

It's about a minute and half in length.

Hunter drowns out the other kids with his monotonal singing.

He's holding a staff and is dressed as a shepherd with a black headband on
the row below the back row angels.

	There is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we've all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks, but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could've been, I guess there
are a lot of people who were saved. . .




			Subject: The odds are against them

			By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
			destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US.
These were deplorable
			acts
			that we will never forget. But now is a time to look
at the other side of
			the
			numbers coming out of New York, Washington and
Pennsylvania. The sad
			but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
			  - the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about
the attacks.

			*** The Buildings ***

			* The World Trade Center -
			The twin towers of the World Trade Center were
places of employment for
			some
			50,000 people. With the missing list of just over
5,000 people, that means
			90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A
90% on a test is an 'A'.

			* The Pentagon -
			Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the Pentagon.
			The latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives. That is an amazing
			99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to
have come in too low,
			too early to affect a large portion of the building.
On top of that, the
			section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
			that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist
attacks. It had
			recently
			completed straightening and blastproofing, saving
untold lives. This attack
			was sad, but a statistical failure.

			*** The Planes ***

			* American Airlines Flight 77
			This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the Pentagon could have
			carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard.
Luckily 78% of the seats
			were empty.

			* American Airlines Flight 11
			This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard, but only carried
			92.
			Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled.

			* United Airlines Flight 175
			Another Boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
			board. Fortunately it was 81% empty.

			* United Airlines Flight 93
			This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet. The smallest
			flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
			84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
			thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark, saving
			untold numbers of lives in the process.

			*** In Summary ***
			Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly
targeted by these inept
			cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's
a higher survival rate
			than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney
transplants and liver transplants
			- all common, survivable illnesses.

			The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon
was hit at it's
			strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people
in the World Trade
			Center buildings escaped, and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
			sacrifice to save even more lives.

			Pass this information on to those in fear and the
media. Don't fear these
			terrorists. The odds are against them.

Amy Brock

Send me a request of who you want, and I will make the transaction this
evening...expecting that no one ahead of you in the waiver ranking makes a
bid for the same person.  The new player will be available for this weekend
(assuming the games are on!), and you will be dropped to the bottom of the
waiver ranking system.  Remember, you can only pick up 2 per week.  Get back
to me when you want!

How true - isn't it amazing and wonderful to see prayers in public -
Congress on the Capitol steps.  It would be interesting to know when this
original prayer was given - I can not imagine people walking out of prayers
at this point in time...

A little something to make us think about the impact

OPENING PRAYER -- KANSAS STATE SENATE
Thought you might enjoy this interesting prayer given
in KANSAS at the opening session of their Senate. It
seems prayer still upsets some people.

When Minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new
session of the KANSAS SENATE, everyone was expecting
the usual generalities, but this is what they heard:

OPENING PRAYER -- KANSAS STATE SENATE
Thought you might enjoy this interesting prayer given
in KANSAS at the opening session of their Senate. It
seems prayer still upsets some people.

When Minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new
session of the KANSAS SENATE, everyone was expecting
the usual generalities, but this is what they heard:

" Heavenly Father, we come before you today to ask
your forgiveness and to seek your direction and
guidance.

We know Your Word says, "Woe to those who call evil
good", but that is exactly what we have done.

We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed
our values.  We confess that.

We have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and
called it Pluralism.

We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery,

We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare,

We have killed our unborn and called it choice,

We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable,

We have neglected to discipline our children and
called it building self-esteem,

We have abused power and called it politics,

We have coveted our neighbor's possessions and called
it ambition,

We have polluted the air with profanity and
pornography and called it freedom of statement,

We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our
forefathers and called it enlightenment.

Search us, Oh, God, and know our hearts today; cleanse
us from every sin and set us free.  Guide and bless
these men and women who have been sent to direct us to
the center of Your will and to openly ask these things
in the name of Your Son, the living Savior, Jesus
Christ.  " Amen.!! "

The response was immediate. A number of legislators
walked out during the prayer in protest.  In 6 short
weeks, Central Christian Church, where Rev. Wright is
pastor, logged more than 5,000 phone calls with only
47 of those calls responding negatively.  The church
is now receiving international requests for copies of
this prayer from India, Africa, and Korea.
Commentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on his radio
program, " The Rest of the Story ", and received a
larger response to this program than any other he has
ever aired. With the Lord's help, may this prayer
sweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become our
desire so that we again can be called, " one nation
under God. " If possible, please pass this prayer on
to your friends.  Think about this: If you forward
this prayer to everyone on your email list in less
than 30 days it would be heard by the world.

The following seminar will be given several times this year.  The 
distinguished list of speakers is as follows:

   Bryan Hull
   Chad Landry
   Tim Blanchard
   Bob Cotten

A cameo appearance will be made by Dr. Mick Walters, esq.  Of course, this 
seminar will be moderated by Yours Truly.  

Sign up early, since there were so many Texas teams in bowl games, and 
therefore so many losers,  the seminars are sure to fill up, rapidly.  

P. Love - I am sure it is little consolation, but at least you covered.

     
     P.S. Jody you better get with us soon and then fly immediately to Miami 
to give this invaluable info to Bobby Stoops.

evening. We need to show up at the Aerodrome  shortly after 11:00, and we'll 
have the ice from 11:15-12:15.??After  that we'll go home and the kids will 
go on to other stuff till 2:30!  
?
See you at the Aerodrome.
?
Bobby

Hey-  both of you guys did a great job on Janet's deal. The pricing was done 
correctly. The swing I wasn't aware of, but 5000+- per month is not a big 
deal. The problem was that offers didn't get stood on.

  Because I'm a man, when I lock my keys in the car I will
  fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your
  suggestions that we call a road service until long after
  hypothermia has set in.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, when the car isn't running very well,
  I will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if I know what
  I'm looking at.  If another man shows up, one of us will say
  to the other, "I used to be able to fix these things, but now
  with all these computers and everything, I wouldn't know
  where to start."
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, when I catch a cold I need someone to
  bring me soup and take care of me while I lie in bed and moan.
  You never get as sick as I do, so for you this isn't an issue.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, I can be relied upon to purchase basic
  groceries at the store, like milk or bread. I cannot be expected
  to find exotic items like  "Cumin" or "Tofu" or "Cardamom."
  For all I know these are all the same thing.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, when one of our appliances stops working
  I will insist on taking it apart, despite evidence that this will just
  cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and
  has to put it back together.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, I must hold the television remote control
  in my hand while I watch TV. If the thing has been misplaced,
  I may miss a whole show looking for it (though one time I was
  able to survive by holding a calculator).
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I
  don't think we should stop and ask someone. Why would
  you listen to a complete stranger -- I mean, how could he
  know where we're going?
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, I do not want to visit your Mother,
  or have your Mother come visit us, or talk to her when she
  calls, or think about her any more than I have to.
  Whatever you got her for Mother's Day is  okay, I don't
  need to see it. And don't forget to pick up something for
  my Mom, too!
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, you don't have to ask me if I liked the
  movie. Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, yes, I have to turn up the radio when
  Bruce Springsteen or The Doors comes on, and then,
  yes, I have to tell you every single time about how Bruce
  had his picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek the
  same day, or how Jim Morrison is buried in Paris and
  everyone visits his grave.  Please do not behave as if you
  do not find this fascinating.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, I think what you're wearing is fine.
  I thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine,
  too.  Either pair of shoes is fine.  With the belt or without it
  looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look fine.
  Can we just go now?
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because I'm a man, and this is, after all, the 2000's, I will
  share equally in the housework. You just do the laundry,
  the cooking, the gardening, the cleaning, and the dishes. I'll
  do the rest.

Hey man this is Stacy. I was checking out the HighSchoolAlumni website
tonight and I saw your name and thought I'd write ya. Man I can't believe
it's been this long. Last time I saw you was that night at A&M when you, me
and John Agee went out drinking and running over signs. I was living up in
Dallas for about 4 years but I moved back to MP about a year ago. I also got
married and had a little baby girl in since then too. Anyway I just wanted
to say hi. Hope I'm emailing the right person here. Mail me back man.


PS.. Maybe we can get Scotty T, Jim Richey, and us together for that fabled
camping trip.

Cya

Good God ---- where do you find time for all of that. You  should write a book when the kids go off to college. By then you should have  many many stories.
 
By the way what is your new address? I may want to come by  some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack. Watching you work sounds better  than anything on TV.
 
You will make a good trader. Good relationships and flexible  pricing are all you need. Oh, and a few zillion other intangibles you will  run into. It beats the hell out of most other things though.
 
I'll let you be for now, but do keep those stories coming ----  we love them.

Subject: Fwd: Thought this was important


 Subject: Please read, sign, and pass on.

THOUGH SHE'S DEAD AND HAS JUST BEEN LOCATED, AFTER 5 YEARS, THIS LADY
CONTINUES TO HAUNT US FROM HER SHALLOW GRAVE.
GET THIS:

CBS will be forced to discontinue "Touched by an Angel" for using the word
God in every program. Madeline Murray O'Hare, an atheist, successfully
managed to eliminate the use of Bible reading from public schools a few
years ago. Now her organization has been granted a  Federal Hearing on the
same subject by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington,
DC. Their petition, Number 2493,  would ultimately pave the way to stop the
reading of the gospel our Lord and Savior, and the airwaves of America.

They got 287,000 signatures to back their stand! If this attempt is
successful, all Sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by
television will be stopped. This group is also campaigning to remove all
Christmas programs and Christmas carols from public schools!! You as a
Christian can help!

We are praying for at least 1 million signatures. This would defeat their
effort and how that there are many Christians alive, well and concerned
about our country. As christians we must unite on this.

Please don't take this lightly. We ignored this lady once and lost prayer in
our school and in offices across the nation.

Please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard.
Together we
can make a  difference in our country while creating an opportunity
for the lost to know the Lord.

Please press "forward", CLEAN UP THE MESSAGE, and forward this to everyone
that you think should read this.

Now, please sign your name at the bottom (you can only add your name after
you have pressed the "Forward").

Don't delete any other names, just go to the next number and type your name.
Please do not sign jointly, such as Mr. & Mrs. Each person should sign
his/her own name.

Please e-mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this, and help
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion.

Hey fellas!

Just for my records, each of you guys have paid the $20 dues for the
league...here's just a little last bit of info for you.

This is the last week of the regular season...after that comes the
divisional playoffs, followed by the Superbowl.

The same week as the Superbowl, another exciting game will be played for the
first time ever, pitting our 2 worst teams in the league against each other,
hacking it out for bragging rights...THE TOILET BOWL!

Rewards break down:

Superbowl winner:	$125
Runner-up:		$50
Toilet Bowl champ:	$25

Thanks fellas, and get back with me if you are interested in doing a $5
College Bowl sheet against each other...(you know, where you pick the
winners from each bowl game)...we already have a few who are in for this!

-The Commish

Dave,
Guess I had some misinformation on the type.  Per Yvette, the platelets or cells in Darren Farmer's blood were the match and the blood type was secondary.  I'm not sure how it works, but Darren is definitely the guy.  I have a call in to Lisa to clarify this.

Hi Dave,

Thanks for offering to talk to Darren about Lisa & Christopher.  Lisa can be reached at home at 281-296-0788 or cell 713-443-4523.  I'm sure she can fill in the details on how to have the blood credited to her account.

Anyone else you know of who has B- blood and would like to give would be MUCH appreciated!

Kris

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?	A "How to Exercise Options" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Please take time to review this material.  It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative.

Hey guys and girls!? I've attached an outline  that Brad used at Saturn 
Road.??You might want to use...it kind of  dovetails with the evangelism 
focus that Shon's incorporating into his sermons  and the Connection group 
topics.? And since it's Valentine's day this  Wednesday, you might want to 
use Wednesday night for something light to shake  things up.? As always, it's 
your call!

Hey--Just thought I'd let you know that Lacy went to school this morning-pale & not feeling well--stomach still hurts, but she went ahead.  She's stressing me out big time.  She acted like she couldn't hardly move, but I came back in the house & she was talking fine on the telephone.  But I ask her questions about how she feels & she is just about dead.  I don't know about her.  But she looked pale.  Blood sugar was a little low this morning.  I woke her up at 2 & had her check it & it was good. So I got a little more rest.  I don't think she even woke up enough to remember it.  I don't think the little job is good for her if she's gonna catch everything they have.  She's so careless about washing hands after handling all those nasty little kids & then bites her nails.  Not good!  Anyway, I'm stressed big time over her & over her driving the car. And missing so much school.  I wasn't going to take her to the dr. yesterday because she was better so I figured it was a virus, b!
ut she had to have a note from a doctor or she's gonna have to make up school on Saturday & they've threatened to fine me. So I had to pay $30 for them to tell me that she had a virus & missed a day of work.  Oh, well, life is fun.  Anyway, I need to quit gettin down over such trivial things cause there's so many with worse problems to face. I am thankful that the burdens are so light.  But you can still pray for us.  And encourage Lacy to work at Splash Town! Ha!
Remind me to tell you about the terroristic  threat at High School.  Another high stress time!  Can't wait until this weekend to see all my cousins & ya'll.  Kiss my grandsons for me.  Love ya

Subject: Special Prayer Request


Hi,

I am coming to you with a very special prayer request.  We have some good
friends here in Nashville, Mark and Melanie Burress and their one year old
baby Gracie, who have recently received some devastating news.  Mark was
diagnosed in December with leukemia.  His is normally a very slow spreading
form of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast.  He
also has a rare DNA type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donor
list (out of 4.5 million) were possible matches and all have since been
elimnated.  We held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this past
weekend and over 1200 people came to donate.  This amazed the people running
the drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most.

If a donor is not found by June his chances are very, very slim to live to
July.  He has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in Houston at the
Anderson hospital so I am asking if there is anyone in Houston who knows of
a
strong, supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend (when
possible) while they are there, that would be greatly appreciated.  If a
donor is located, they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and he
won't be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due to
his
immune system being weakened.  As you can imagine, this would put his wife
in
a severe state of limbo, having to be primary caregiver to someone who is
incapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together.

It is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to live
for
to be facing such a hard fight.  Please keep his family in your prayers and
I
know if there is a miracle with Marks' name on it, God will provide it.

If you could please pass this on to the Chi Sigs/Regina list, every little
prayer they get will be appreciated.

Thank you!

Celeste (Sasser) Ortega

For faster viewing, I would suggest you go to the first page of pictures and
click the "Small Slideshow" link. This will bring down all the photos at
once, and will cycle through all of them four times in a slideshow. Please
note that it might take some time to download all the pictures, depending
upon the speed of your connection to the Internet.

After the slideshow starts, all of the regular-sized pictures on the other
pages will temporarily be on your PC, which should make clicking through
each page a little faster.

If you run into problems viewing any of the pages/pictures, please drop me a
note.

Tonya/Daren: You will probably be more interested in the pictures on pages 5
and 6, which is also the fifth and sixth rows of the index page.

Thanks,

-Ram.

Daren, tell Tonya I called Edie last night about my W-2.  She said that they
got a new CPA & he has been told to mail them but hasn't.  She gave me the
amount that will show on the form.  It was $1500. I wrote it down at home
how much the net was, but I didn't bring it with me.  I had drawn some off
paying for Lacy's Tiger Doll stuff.  She said that she would tell him again
to get them mailed. Love, Ma

Three things:
??? ??? 
Here is this week's material.? There's  probably way too much stuff to use it 
all, so I wouldn't even try.? Pick  out the things and questions that you 
feel are the most important and will hit  your group the best.? Just remember 
that this material is only one part of  what needs to be happening in your 
NEON group.? The getting to know and  share with each other is critical--use 
one of the icebreaker  activities you have (even if it seems cheesy) or 
somehow ask questions and get  the group talking with each other or about 
themselves.
?
See the note above the material about the CD in  your NEON box.
?
Finally, I haven't let you know about the new  leaders we have working with 
us, specifically with Carol Poe and the Backors in  NEON Silver--Leslie and 
Debbie Bills!? Welcome Debbie and Les!
?
Keep up the great work!

Is "not going to AEP" considered an accomplishment?  By the way, most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company.  I'm sure they thought that I was superior though.

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Just a note to tell each of you that I appreciate your efforts today in our 
lengthy meeting.  I think you all were very professional, and you all asked 
the right questions of each other.  I was very proud of the level of 
performance I saw today, and think this group has strengthened over the last 
six months, which was one of our goals.  The challenges today were healthy 
and with merit.  I realize it is a difficult process, but I appreciate your 
patience to work through the process.  I know each of you realize the 
importance of our building a strong team, as we are only as strong as our 
people.  We are required to identify strengths and weaknesses to help the 
employee become stronger.  Enron is the best, and we are obligated to build 
the very best teams to ensure we deliver the very best services.  If we do 
not, we all fail.

Good job, today.  Once again, thank you.

A friend of mine that I've known since college at Harding is looking for a
job in IT or consulting.

His last stint was as a Senior Systems Engineer in Compaq's SAP Solutions
Center.

He's a stellar guy, and very smart, as you can tell from his resume.

If you know of any opportunities, please pass this along.

Thanks,

Subject: Press Release from Kyle Field


College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31.  "The end
zones were confusing," says Slocum.  "I'm sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.  We were
scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points.  There's no way we lost this one.  A&M demands a
recount."

Oklahoma officials are calling this "outrageous".  "They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off," replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  "If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
before we started.  You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with
the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points
many times."

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  "We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of
the game," says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used.  "They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,"
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, "A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"  Students' thoughts
echoed their signs.  "All we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner," says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.  "We need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner."

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point.  At about 2:30
pm, with the game still too close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call.  "We felt that with
a number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we
were certain A&M would carry this game.  We may have been premature in our
prediction."

It's me, Kari Bullington.  I just thought I would drop you a line and say
hello!!!  How are you?

I sure hated to hear about Troy.  I don't understand how something like that
can happen to such an all around great person.

Hope to hear from you!!

Kari

Daren,
Thanks for the Sitara training class that you taught the logistics group.  It 
was extremely valuable
for me and the rest of the group.  I appreciate all the time and effort that 
you put into setting this up.
The handouts will be great reference material for us in the future.  I have 
already heard  very positive 
feedback from the group.  Very much appreciated.  Thanks again,   Pat Clynes

Thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request.  There 
has been some confusion concerning the Dinner Only option.  If you are 
planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option.  It 
is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.   

We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the HPL 
Anniversary Celebration.  Please email me with the name you would like to 
appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc.   If we do not hear from you 
by Wednesday, August 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we 
acquired from HR.  Please print this memo for any employees who do not have 
access to email.

Thank you so much for your help.

Hi,
 
The number is 281-370-7838.
 
I did not think of it, but without the pipe one has to balance  ones own, doesn't one. Of course the major problem was the people with HPL, not  the counter-parties. Who's doing that for you guys?
 
Jen came home for the Memorial Day weekend so we just bummed  around. Saw Pearl Harbor, watched a few DVD's, and ate way to much.
 
When you get time let us know about your "bad luck". I hope  Jake wasn't helping you too much.
 
I have been occupying much to much time with our new sound  system. We finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of Yamaha  stuff coupled to an equally large stack of Klipsch speakers. Awesome is the only  word to apply. I'm sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door. (It's  a young couple with a baby) (Not near as nice as the other young couple I  know).
Rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good.  :)
 
Stock market still sucks, but as long as it pays for groceries  and taxes we'll be OK.
 
I'm off to get Linda's gas guzzlin, environment ruining, SUV  washed and buffed. Then I must re-stock my CD-R's and load up on some more  music. You can see how well I'm utilizing my time in doing productive  things.
 
Later,
Ken
 
P. S. I thought WAHA was where all the pillaging of California  was taking place.

Folks,

You've probably already read that listbot is dying as of August 6.

So, I've created a transition list on another service. To send messages to
the list, please start using the following e-mail address:

	brcc.yf@topica.com

I plan on closing the old list (bammelyoundfamilies@listbot.com) as of
Friday, August 13.

If you are still interested in participating in the "Bammel Young Families"
list, please send an e-mail to "brcc.yf-subscribe@topica.com".

If you think you'll want to check the past messages, or to create your own
lists in the future, use the following steps:

1. Go to http://www.topica.com/lists/brcc.yf

2. On the right hand side of the page, type in your e-mail address under
"Not a Topica Member yet"

3. Click "Continue"

4. Fill in the registration, then click the "I agree" button

5. You'll next see a page with text like "Thanks, Ram! You're almost done."

6. Scroll to the end of this page, and click the "continue" button.

7. A dialog will pop-up, asking whether you want to "tap into exclusive...
blah, blah, blah". Just click Cancel.

Once you join the new list, please drop me an e-mail to
"rtackett@abacustech.net". I'll then delete you from the old so that you
won't get duplicate messages from both lists.

The messages on the new list will be available to members online at:

	http://www.topica.com/lists/brcc.yf

One nice feature of topica is the ability to put messages on "Vacation
Hold", so that we don't end up with auto-responder problems. For more info
on "vacation hold", go to http://topica.com/# and then click on the
"vacation hold" link under "subscriber services".


Thanks,

Dear Christian friends,
Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus!
We have two very urgent prayer requests. Our dear friend and a brother, Dav=
id Gatewood, the son of late Otis Gatewood, has been recently diagnosed a p=
ancreas cancer. David and his wife Sandy were two of the first people who i=
ntroduced Dragica and me to Christ and His Church over thirty years ago. In=
 1969 they came to Croatia (Yugoslavia at that time), as missionaries, with=
 another couple, Bud and Beverly Pickl. In order to get their resident visa=
s, they enrolled in a Croatian language study program. I was their professo=
r at that time, and we became very good and close friends. David and Sandy =
have been connected with the Lord?s work in Croatia for all these years. Be=
fore leaving Croatia in 1972, they adopted a little Croatian girl, whom the=
y raised with much love. She is a married woman now, and lives in Colorado =
Springs. David and Sandy made several trips to Croatia during the war, and =
David taught seminars on post-war traumatic experiences and the value of a =
family. Your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in Croatia who lov=
e David dearly.
Also, please, put me (Mladen) on your prayer list. For several months now I=
?ve been having some prostate problems. Ten days ago my doctor requested a =
biopsy, and I am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming Monday. D=
ragica and I believe God listens and hears  prayers of His people.
Please, join the Church in Croatia with your prayers.

Hi Daren,

I enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning.
You have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations. You are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings This a good formula for
success and I will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward.  With this in mind, I had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that I would like to share.

You are in a transition from being a  high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team.  One of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team.  At first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them, then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with  you.  You have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers.  You are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use.  You
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for.  You have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team.

This issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting.  The question is: How to engage the team in solving this
problem.  How do I get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions?  What resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem? How do I involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem? What new behaviors do I need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team?  What do I need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem?

There is one dimension that I am clear about. I know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback.  Have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members?

I look forward to our meeting on the 17th.  Keep growing!

Mike

Subject:	Tribute to America



Subject:	Tribute to America

 I needed to read this in light of yesterday's events.....

TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES
 This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.

America: The Good Neighbor.
 Widespread but only partial news coverage was given
 recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
 Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television
 Commentator. What follows is the full text of his
 trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional
 Record:


 "This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
 Americans as the most generous and possibly the
 least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany,
 Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy
 were lifted out of the debris of war by the
 Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
 forgave other billions in debts.

 None of these countries is today paying even the
 interest on its remaining debts to the United
 States. When France was in danger of collapsing in
 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and
 their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
 streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.

 When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
 United States that hurries in to help. This spring,
 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.
 Nobody helped. The Marshall Plan and the Truman
 Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
 countries. Now newspapers in those countries are
 writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.

 I'd like to see just one of those countries that is
 gloating over the erosion of the United States
 dollar build its own airplane. Does any other
 country in the world have a plane to equal the
 Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the
 Douglas DC10?

 If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the
 International lines except Russia fly American
 Planes? Why does no other land on earth even
 consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You
 talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
 You talk about German technocracy, and you get
 automobiles. You talk about American technocracy,
 and you find men on the moon - not once, but several
 times - and safely home again.

 You talk about scandals, and the Americans put
 theirs right in the store window for everybody to
 look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
 and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most
 of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are
 getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to
 spend here.

 When the railways of France, Germany and India were
 breaking down through age, it was the Americans who
 rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the
 New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an
 old caboose. Both are still broke.

 I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced
 to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name
 me even one time when someone else raced to the
 Americans in trouble? I don't think there was
 outside help even during the San Francisco
 earthquake.


 Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
 Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
 kicked around. They will come out of this thing
 with their flag high. And when they do, they are
 entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
 gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada
 is not one of those."

 Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!

***************************************************************
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever
 read regarding the United States. It is nice that
 one man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of
 the world would realize it. We are always blamed for
 everything, and never even get a thank you for the
 things we do.

 I would hope that each of you would send this to as
 many people as you can and emphasize that they
 should send it to as many of their friends until
 this letter is sent to every person on the web. I am
 just a single American that has read this, TRIBUTE TO
 THE UNITED STATES

TRAVEL TO MILWAUKEE

A friendly city with a decidedly sophisticated air, this midwestern gem 
offers plenty of art and cultural events, nightlife, and beautiful lakeside 
parks. And there's plenty to do indoors in Milwaukee, so don't let the 
February weather keep you away.

In addition to the professional basketball action on Saturday night (Indiana 
comes to town to play Milwaukee), here's a few other ideas to get your 
planning started.

THE HAGGERTY MUSEUM OF ART
Located on the western end of downtown on the Marquette University campus, 
the museum's collection includes works by Dali, Chagall and Man Ray. You'll 
also find an impressive collection of sculpture and contemporary glass.

THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MUSEUM
This museum of human and natural history is one of the nation's best and 
often sets the standard for similar institutions. Everyone in the family will 
enjoy the engaging exhibits. You'll find 150,000 square feet of exhibit 
space, through which you'll be able to visit all of the world's continents. 
Find the museum and The Humphrey IMAX Dome Theater at 800 West Wells Street.

Hi again,
?
I can hardly wait for some good stuff regarding my "friend". I  do hope you 
understand I am not against the person or persons -- just the way  they do 
their jobs.
?
I can't believe Pat just left. Must have been a really bad  meeting. Who took 
his place?

I see Henry Hub was close to $7.50 yesterday. Amazing. Your  producers must 
be happy.
?
Trees -- ha. It is getting to be a choice between trees or  gifts. 
?
Markets up nicely, courts ruling nicely, Greenspan softening  his stance on 
interest, Linda not shopping as much as prior years. Looking good  today.
?
Later,
Ken

Remember Me?  I'm the one who loved you so much that I gave my very best at
raising you. And now I'm missing you so much. Lacy & I can't  understand why
you don't call to check on us & just to talk a while--it doesn't count that
Tonya calls--I didn't raise her.We want to hear your voice every once in a
while.  I know you work a lot, but you used to find time once a week.And
that's no excuse. You can schedule in a call to us.  We're still your family
too.  We love you, Ma

Hey Guys and Girls,
?
Here's an idea for an icebreaker activity for our  2nd week of NEON.? This is 
only an idea, you can use it or do something  totally different.? Again, let 
me know along the way if you have something  that has worked well for your 
group so we can share in the wealth.
?
Someone in your group should have a couple of  classic books full of 
icebreaker-game type of activities, Building Community  in Youth Groups, and 
Youth Group Trust Builders.? We all at  one time had a selection of 
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still  have somewhere in a 
drawer.? Spend time in the games and forced  interactions, especially over 
the beginning of the semester.? If you don't  have these resources, let me 
know.? Even if some of these ideas may seem  familiar to you, remember that 
you may have been doing this far longer than the  oldest kids have been in 
your group.?But again, if you have any ideas for  resources let me know.
?
In addition to the ideas to think about at the top  of the 2nd weeks topic, a 
couple of additional thoughts given me by  leaders:
??? -Realize and possibly  communicate in a low key manner to the freshman 
that their expectations of NEON  may not initially be met.? They may be 
coming in with ideas of what NEON  is, only to possibly be disappointed.? In 
a sense it is similar to going to  a restaurant or movie after tons of people 
have recommended it to you, and being  a little let down.? More importantly, 
they need to realize that NEON is not  an event, it is a process.? The teens 
who say they love it are most often  the ones who have been in it long enough 
to have built relationships and to have  shared a bunch of common 
experiences.? With time and a commitment on their  part to be at NEON weekly, 
their expectations will ultimately be  met.
??? -Remember that the best quality  time you have with the kids is probably 
before or after NEON, or at other  non-NEON times.
?
Have fun loving on your kids  Wednesday!
?
Bobby

Daren,

I contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday.
However, I know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week
is extremely slim.  I hope that you have a great day anyway and a great
weekend with your precious family.  We'll give you a call this evening or
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting (and so Sally can sing to
you).

We are so looking forward to seeing you, Tonya, Cole and Jake next weekend.
We're disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
come a few days early.  We will certainly enjoy our visit with them.

Thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to Tonya that you
are.  It gives Sally and me such joy seeing Tonya highly honored and loved
by you.  You are a wonderful father too and it's so apparent the bond of
love that you enjoy with your sons.  They watch your every move and hang on
your every word.  We're so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader
of your family, for being such an outstanding provider for their every need,
and for putting up with the "outlaws".  In addition to our friendship, I
love you as my own son.  Again, happy birthday.


David

Please respond to Hi Bubba!

Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better. She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.

Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy's.  Let him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye "fixed".
Lacy's eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.  He couldn't believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she smiles.  She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next week.  We'll talk later about when we are coming to your house.I'm going to Longview to a singles retreat Sat.in case you call & I'm not there.  Will be home Sat. night. Love ya, Maw

Ho ho ho, we're around to that most  wonderful time of the year---NEON leaders retreat time!
 
I know that  this time of year is extremely  hectic, and that it's tough to think about anything past the holidays, but life  does go on past the week of December 25 through January 1, and that's what I'd  like you to think about for a minute.
 
On the calender that I handed out at the beginning  of the fall semester, the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of January  5-6.  But because of a youth ministers conference that Brad and Dustin are  connected with that week, we're going to change the date to the following  weekend, January 12-13.  Now comes the part you need to think  about.
 
I think we all agree that it's important for us to  get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far  into the spring semester, but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult  for us to get away without kids, etc.  So, Brad came up with a potential  alternative for how we can get together on that weekend, and then you can let me  know which you prefer.
 
The first option would be to have a  retreat similar to what we've done the past several years.  This year  we could go to the Heartland Country Inn (www.heartlandcountryinn.com )  outside of Brenham.  It's a nice place, where we'd have a 13-bedroom  and a 5-bedroom house side by side.  It's in the country, real relaxing,  but also close to Brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from  here.  We can golf, shop in the antique and craft stores in Brenham, eat  dinner together at the ranch, and spend time with each other.  We'd meet on  Saturday, and then return on Sunday morning, just like what we've done in the  past.
 
The second option would be to stay here in  Houston, have dinner together at a nice restaurant, and then have dessert  and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that Saturday  evening.  This might be easier, but the trade off would be that we wouldn't  have as much time together.  I'll let you decide.
 
Email me back with what would be your preference,  and of course if you're available on that weekend.  The democratic process  will prevail--majority vote will rule!  Let me hear from you as soon as  possible, preferably by the end of the weekend.  And if the vote doesn't go  your way, no complaining allowed (like I tend to do!)
 
Have a great weekend, great golf, great fishing,  great shopping, or whatever makes you happy!
 
Bobby

Subject: The OSU game and Aggie Spirit 
This just in Ags!  If you are going to the OSU game on Sept 22, a Red, White 
& Blue Out is being planned, just like the Maroon Out games for the OSU 
game. 
Ags, What better statement can we Aggies make, than to celebrate the love 
and support for our country's freedom, and our patriotic nature, than this 
way: 
Imagine...The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band playing "The Star Spangled Banner," 
playing military drills as they walk around the stadium, and we celebrate 
our love for our country, and our support for all the heroes, alive and 
deceased.  Color assignments are as follows: 
                3rd deck: Red 
                2nd deck: White 
                1st deck: Blue 
Pass the word on.... we have 1 1/2 weeks!! 
The Spirit of America, and the Aggie Spirit is still alive.  God Bless 
America, the Free Nation. 
Pass it on.

I had computer problems today, which snarf'd all the addresses that I have
previous e-mailed you folks. None of those previous http address are valid
any more.

So, look to http://24.27.98.30/pictures/index.htm to find a table of
contents of July pictures. I'll try to keep this updated, as new pictures
are posted.

Guys, 
Just thought you might find this interesting.? I was forwarded this 
poem, and told it was written by a high school student in Az. 
Regardless, of who/where (not the point) I find it interesting, weirdly 
amusing, and frighteningly fairly accurate.- PB 

Now I sit me down in school 
Where praying is against the rule 
For this great nation under God 
Finds mention of Him very odd. 

If Scripture now the class recites, 
It violates the Bill of Rights. 
And anytime my head I bow 
Becomes a Federal matter now. 

Our hair can be purple, orange or green, 
That's no offense, it's a freedom scene. 
The law is specific, the law is precise. 
Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice. 

For praying in a public hall 
Might offend someone with no faith at all. 
In silence alone we must meditate, 
God's name is prohibited by the state. 

We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks, 
And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks. 
They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible. 
To quote the Good Book makes me liable. 

We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen, 
And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King. 
It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong, 
We're taught that such "judgments" do not belong. 

We can get our condoms and birth controls, 
Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles. 
But the Ten Commandments are not allowed, 
No word of God must reach this crowd. 

It's scary here I must confess, 
When chaos reigns the school's a mess. 
So, Lord, this silent plea I make, 
Should I be shot; My soul please take!

I am hooked. Name the time and place to  meet......................
?
Tell Ami good luck for me.

Who would have thunk OU would be back so quickly. Now we have  to contend 
with them, K-State, and the conference championship (if we survive).  I don't 
see the Big 12 being #1 if we don't lighten up on each  other.

You want a chuckle----- My daughter is a big NU fan and has  gone to a couple 
of Baylor games.?Says it's not quite the same as Lincoln;  but the 
expectations are not high.

Let me know on lunch and I'll be there.

Here is an idea for this week.? Next week Brad  Cox is planning on starting a 
discussion series based on the Experiencing God  study, that he will modify 
for teenagers to be used in NEON.? It will  probably consist mainly of 
questions similar to what you're getting this  week.? At this point in the 
semester your kids hopefully feel comfortable  with each other to go ahead 
and spring right into some Biblically relevant  discussions.? Make sure, 
though, that you do what is necessary for your  kids to connect with each 
other and with you as adults and to make visitors feel  at ease.? Spend time 
visiting together as a group, and then individually  with the kids after NEON 
is officially over with cokes and cookies.?  Remember that that the "before 
and after" is probably the most important aspect  of NEON.

Hey! I'v almost got the curtains finished.  Been so busy, everything's so
busy this week.  I probably won't get them mailed until Mon.'cause I have to
borrow a car from someone at work in order to get to the Post Office in time
before it closes in this hick town, & everyone goes home early & don't want
to wait around on Fri.  But I'll get them there asap.  They won't have
buttons, 'cause Tonya didn't know what kind she wanted when we got the
material. We'll be at competition all day Sat. at Plano & then at Shane's
Sat. night. Home Sun. sometime.  Wish ya'll could be with us.  Lacy is in 3
different routines--she made all of them.On front row.Maybe I can see her
ok.  Gotta go. Let me know if you get this. My comp. is kinda messed up.
Give Cole a hug. Love, Ma

Here are some ideas for this coming  Wednesday.? Remember that the following 
week is our last NEON of this  semester, and it's your call as to what you

Our CEO was contacted by a David Gardner, president of Gardner Energy in
Houston regarding a five-year package of gas.  I spoke to him only briefly
but did not get a good feeling about him or his deal.  Do you know of this
firm?  I was unable to pull up anything on the internet.  I suspect he's
just a marketer.

Don't spend any time on this.  I was just curious as to whether or not you
know of him or his firm.  Thanks.

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a "cushy"  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
Internet" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of
the greatest Presidents of our history."

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

Subject:	Survivor 2


A major network is planning the show "Survivor 2" this winter. In
response,
Texas is planning "Survivor: Texas Style." The contestants will
start in  Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San Antonio, over to
Houston,
and down to Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio, on to El Paso,
then to Midland/Odessa, Lubbock, and Amarillo. From there, they proceed to
Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.
Each will be driving a pink Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads, "I'm
gay,    I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."
The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

BH,

I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 
7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during 
trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that 
everything will be covered.  

I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer 
trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest 
idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will 
take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the 
office for half the day.  I can also come in for the half day on the 7th if 
we decide that is needed.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Here are some ideas for discussion this  week.??
?
Next week we won't be meeting, and after that we  will have only two meeting 
times left before Christmas.? Be thinking about  what you'll want to do as a 
group?for the last meeting, since it'll be here  real soon.? Some groups have 
a party, with a Chinese gift exchange (why is  it called Chinese?), or some 
go to eat somewhere and then go as a group in a van  or suburban to look at 
Christmas lights, etc.? If your group doesn't have  some tradition or 
enjoyable end to the semester, be imaginative and see if you  can't come up 
with something fun to do.? Of course if you need help let me  know!
?

 Bryant Gumbel recently interviewed Billy Graham's daughter.

 Gumbel: "Why didn't God stop this or do something about this?"

 Billy Graham's daughter: "For years we have told God we didn't want
 Him in our schools. We didn't want Him in our government and we
 didn't want Him in our finances and God was being a perfect gentleman in
 doing just what we asked Him to do. We need to make up our mind - do
 we want God or do we not want Him. We cannot just ask Him in when
 disaster strikes."

 Bryant Gumbel was silent.

Hey!  Guess it was hard to get back, huh!  I was going to get Jake one of
those baby wipe warmers and send it with Art & Jo, but Walmart was out of
them. Maybe I need to get something else.  Do you have one of those toys
that goes on the bar of the carrier?  Is Jake ok? Let me hear from you,
please.  I'm making Lacy stay off the phone from 7-9:30 every night so that
you & Shane can have a chance to call if you want to.  I sure do miss
holding Jake and playing with Cole.  Cole is so funny.  I've been telling
everybody things that he does & they can't believe it at 2 yrs. old.  I
gotta get busy--let me know if you get this.  I know you're busy, just a
little answer to let me know 'cause I sent you one a while back that you
never answered and the last 2 that I sent Shane & Shelly they didn't get.
Love ya, Ma

I believe the boat is 18 to 19 ft long and I do have a boat cover.  I will bring the boat information with me tomorrow for anymore questions.  I recently took it to the shop to get it ready for this season and the salesman said it looked brand new.  It has a brand new battery and everything runs perfectly.  Call me if you want to take a look at it.

Hi Bubba!

Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but 
the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been 
having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood 
sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have 
stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much 
better. She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I 
guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was 
wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I 
knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a 
child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.

Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy's.  Let 
him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye "fixed".
Lacy's eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.  
He couldn't believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so 
tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she 
smiles.  She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next 
week.  We'll talk later about when we are coming to your house.I'm going to 
Longview to a singles retreat Sat.in case you call & I'm not there.  Will be 
home Sat. night. Love ya, Maw

I'm glad you got $20 from my favorite person.

Linda has been into the NBA, but I find it unexciting  anymore.
?
Nebraska will go to some obscure bowl, the stock market is  killing me, and 
this election business is nuts.
?
I believe Texas should re-establish itself as a Republic and I  can go to the 
barricades. Now that gets my juices going.
?
Later,
Ken

If you don't have Powerpoint installed, go to

Then you should be able to view the link at

Again, if you are squeemish...don't bother looking at the slides.  It shows

Subject:  Gap certificates


Hey guys, I finally found one that is TRUE!  I went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my GIFT CERTIFICATES already!!!  I sent
enough e-mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the GAP! You know, with all the crap sent over the mail, it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception. Send it to everyone you know, and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe, courtesy of THE GAP!  Isn't it grand?

================================================
Hi! My name is Janelle McCan, Founder of the Gap.

You have probably heard about the e-mail from Abercrombie and Fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to. My question is: DID IT WORK? Most of you who tried it will
probably say NO.

But this letter is NOT prank like others you have experienced. I am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to.
When you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish, a
screen will come up. It will tell you how much you have earned in Gap gift
certificates. Print that screen out and bring it to your local Gap store.
The sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can SHOP BABY!  This
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world.
We
believe this project can be a success, but only with your help.

Thank you for your support!

Sincerely,
Janelle McCan
Founder of Gap

Instead of going to the haunted house, we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved.  The weather is going to nice and cool, so the
plan is to have a fire, eat and then play "Capture the Flag".  We will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side. The goal of the game is to find  your team's flag
and bring it safely back to your side.  Of course, it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky, because if you get caught on your opponent's side, then
you have to wait until you are freed.  It is a very fun game, but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people's personalities.  If
you aren't up to playing the game, then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours.

	General Location:  north of 2920, between Stuebner Airline and
Tomball

Starting point:  Stuebner Airline and 2920
	Directions:	Go west on 2920, towards Tomball
			Go North on 2978, which is at a light, gas stations
on both sides
				(if you've gone into town, then you've
missed it.)
			Drive several miles and take a left at the 3rd
stoplight, which is
				Hardin Store Road (there is a big horse
statue at this corner)
			Go about one mile and take a right at first
stoplight, which is
				Dobbin Huffsmith.
			Go about two miles, as soon as you pass two
convenience stores,
				my parent's house will be about the 5th
driveway on the right.
				the address is on the mailbox-30202 Dobbin
Huffsmith.

			Pull in their first driveway and drive back through
the first gate
				and park by the barn.  You'll see us.


Starting point:  249 and 2920
Directions: 	Go north on 249 towards Magnolia.
			After you pass a long bridge, Take a right on
"Stagecoach", which is at a light.  This road
				will automatically turn into Hardin Store
Road.  Stay on this road for several miles.
			Take a left on "Dobbin Huffsmith", which is at a
light.
			Go about two miles, as soon as you pass two
convenience stores,
				my parent's house will be about the 5th
driveway on the right.
				the address is on the mailbox-30202 Dobbin
Huffsmith.

			Pull in their first driveway and drive back through
the first gate
				and park by the barn.  You'll see us.

for a shorter way.

Did you survive bid week?

I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for 
you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff 
left?
?
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)

Gotta run. Almost have my *&%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a ?personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big ?changes. It sucks.???Later,?Ken????

Thoughts on Texas A&M...
Fox Sports Show Host Jim Rome

1)   They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army,and
red ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in
their urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the
feeling the entire school was built to spite UT.
2)   Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's
passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a
subsidiary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach
agriculture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from
where they get that I don't  now......the fact is, the State intended A&M
to be a branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth fromthe original
creation.  Like Danny Devito in "Twins".
3)   So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must
devote
their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good.
All the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they
won't shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how
they want to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell
them how bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is
the world's largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in
everything A&M does.
4)   The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at
A&M.
There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp.  East Texas'
answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never
learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now,
forget the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades
enroll if they agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps
looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field
in 1995. Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that
have been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, they
just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against
another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a
little actual sodomy.  Not only could I go on with more instances of
idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you
have your own stories.
The point is:
We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however,
nobody respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of
the military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act
like the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect
these clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is
only supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat
up civilians, move to Israel.
5)   It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national
television and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the
stands at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be
against the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to
mount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime
anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and
start sucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked
down upon. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have
moved the game from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were
gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game,
some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's
Thanksgiving dinner. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a
suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board.
Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique
counter. Screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just give
them a veil.
6)   "t.u." is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if
folks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be
funny. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it.
Please learn.
7)   You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of
sheep, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall
down.Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit
whooping in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for
the enjoyment of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing
how to yell. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for
Governor. When you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form
asks for your phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3", Weight
185.  Just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East
Texas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade
education why they cheer for A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base.
This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid.
8)   Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder,
they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability.
 The point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about
marching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high
school band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then
and nobody cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you
do care. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college?
9)   Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the
only
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an
anal probe. Oh wait...I understand now.
10)  Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat
their own feces and should be treated accordingly.
11)  Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that
it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there.That
should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get any
better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending
"Dukes of Hazard" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to
Austin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open
minded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace
and final resting place of all that is cool.

As my friend Stephen Johnson once said: "If the world were ever to get an
enema, College Station is where you would connect the hose." If you go to
school at A&M, please don't be an Aggie.
God Bless the Great State of Texas.

AP-College Station Texas----
Texas A&M football practice was delayed on Monday for nearly two  hours at Kyle Field. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room  happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery  substance on the practice field. 
Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while the FBI was  called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined  that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.  
Practice was resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not  be likely to encounter the substance again.

RED-NECK VALENTINE'S LOVE POEM

Collards is green
my dog's name is Blue
and I'm so lucky
to have a sweet thang like you.

Yore hair is like cornsilk
a-flapping in the breeze
Softer than  OLD Blue's
and without all them fleas.

You move like the bass,
which excite me in May.
You ain't got no scales
but I luv you anyway.

Yo're as satisfy'n as okry
jist a-fry'n in the pan.
Yo're as fragrant as "snuff"
right out of the can.

You have som'a yore teeth,
for which I am proud;
I hold my head high
when we're in a crowd.

On special occasions,
when you shave under yore arms,
well, I'm in hawg heaven,
and awed by yore charms.

Still them fellers at work,
they all want to know,
what I did to deserve
such a purdy, young doe.

Like a good roll of duct tape
yo're there fer yore man,
to patch up life's troubles
and fix what you can.

Yo're as cute as a junebug
a-buzzin' overhead.
You ain't mean like those far ants
I found in my bed.

Cut from the best cloth
like a plaid flannel shirt,
you spark up my life
more than a fresh load of dirt.

When you hold me real tight
like a padded gunrack,
my life is complete;
Ain't nuttin' I lack.

Yore complexion, it's perfection,
like the best vinyl sidin'.
despite all the years,
yore age, it keeps hidin'.

Me 'n' you's  we go together
 just like a Moon Pie
with a RC cold drank,

yep, we go together
like a skunk goes with stank.

Some men, they buy chocolate
for Valentine's Day;
They git it at Wal-Mart,
it's romantic that way.

Some men git roses
on that special day
from the cooler at Kroger.
"That's impressive," I say.

Some men buy fine diamonds
from a flea market booth.
"Diamonds are forever,"
they explain, suave and couth.

But for this man, honey,
these won't do.

Cause yo're too special,
you sweet thang you.

I got you a gift,
without taste nor odor,
more useful than diamonds...

IT'S A NEW TROLLIN' MOTOR!!

l shore due luv you darling,

AINT LOVE GRAND!!!!.....

BUBBA

I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the 
office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of 
your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  

As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business 
will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in 
working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
usual.  

I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to 
work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to 
all that we will accomplish in 2000.

I just have to brag on myself as my game seldom affords me the opportunity.
Sunday after church, Tom Knox and I played 18 holes at Mimosa.  The weather
was perfect.  While my game stunk overall (118), I did manage par on one par
3 and two par 5's.  The best was at 14 --- a 545 yard par 5.  My drive was
280 yards (the ground was flat!).  I was on the green three feet from the
pin in 3, and then two-putted.  Those three pars however will keep me going
back.  Remember, I had a witness!

Thanks for listening to me brag.  And no, don't expect me to replicate these
feats on our next outing.  Hope all are doing well.  We're remembering
Rachel and Jake in our prayers each day.

David

I have felt a renewed heart for God, a fresh spirit.   I have been in the word lately and Doug and I have to committed to prayer time  together each morning.  It has brought a more positive attitude, much joy,  and thankfulness on my part.  And, yes, satan has already tried to steal  that joy.  But he will not prevail, I will not let Him.  So in those  times when I feel that any bit of joy is seeping away, I begin to pray.  I  found this prayer to be refreshing and worded well.  Please read it,  it may just jumpstart your day and you'll be filled with joy.  Have a  great day!  Amber
Please  take a moment to relax your mind and
humble your heart to focus on  Christ.
Allow God, to be the only person on your
mind while you read  this prayer. If we can
take the time to read long jokes, stories,  etc.,
we should give the same respect to this prayer.
Friends that pray  together, stay together.
Let's pray...
 Father  God,
I thank You for this day. I thank You for my
being able to see  and to hear
this morning. I'm blessed because You are a
forgiving God  and an
understanding God. You have done so much for me
and You keep on  blessing me.
Forgive me this day for everything I have done,
said or  thought that was not
pleasing to you. I ask now for Your  forgiveness.
Please keep me safe from all danger and harm.
Help me to  start this day
with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let
me make  the best of each
and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear
from  You.
Please broaden my mind that I can accept all
things. Let me not  whine and
whimper over things I have no control over. Let
me continue to  see sin
through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil.
And when I sin,  let me
repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing,
and receive the  forgiveness
of God.
And when this world closes in on me, let  me
remember Jesus' example - to
slip away and find a quiet place to  pray. It's
the best response when I'm
pushed beyond my limits. I know  that when I can't
pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to  do
Your will.?Continue to bless me that I may
be a blessing to  others.
Keep me strong that I may help the weak. Keep me
uplifted  that I may have
words of encouragement for others. I pray for
those that  are lost and can't
find their way.
 I pray for those that are  misjudged and
misunderstood. I pray for those who
don't know You  intimately. I pray for those that
will delete this without
sharing it  with others. I pray for those that
don't believe. But I thank
you that I  believe.
I believe that God changes people and God changes
things. I  pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each
and every  family member in their households.
I pray for peace, love and joy in  their homes
that they are out of debt and all their needs are  met.
I pray that every eye that reads this knows there
is no  problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God.
Every battle is  in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that
these words  be received into the hearts of every eye that sees
them and every  mouth that confesses them willingly.
This is my prayer.
In  Jesus' Name, Amen.
If you prayed this prayer, change the number  in the subject
box before forwarding the message so people can  SEE how
many people have done so.
> > > >  >>> >
God Bless!!!!!!!!!!!
 Just repeat this phrase  and see how God moves!!
???Lord I love you and I need you, come into  my
???heart, please.

Dear Daren Farmer,

One of the things we like to do here at Expedia is help you
maximize your vacation dollar. Since accommodations are a
big part of every vacation, we went to more than 1,200 quality
hotels in more than 240 cities and negotiated hotel rates up to
70% less than the average standard rates. We call these Expedia
Special Rates, and it's all about saving you money. When you
search for a hotel on Expedia.com, just look for the "Expedia
Special Rates" icon and you'll know you're getting this special rate.

Right now, you can take advantage of an Expedia Special Rate
at the brand-new Aladdin Resort in Las Vegas. This spectacular
hotel just opened, and it features one of the largest collections of
shopping, dining, entertainment, and gaming options available in
Las Vegas. See what it's all about:

Hi,
?
How is the family???? and the multiple jobs??????
?
We just got back from Omaha --- Linda's 40th High School  reunion. I wish 
someone would explain to me who all those old people were that  attended.
?
Putting $1.85 a gallon gas in that beast of hers was sure fun.  I may need a 
part-time job if this keeps up long. (Just kidding -- you probably  have 
enough to deal with -- right)
?
Jennifer has decided to journey off to Law school at Baylor.  She and Linda 
are going to Waco Friday to finalize an apartment. 
Chris is managing the I-10 Texas Land & Cattle store.  Keeps him very busy. 
(can't even send an e-mail ----- like someone else I know)  (Just kidding)
?
We are looking for property on a lake (Linda's request). Like  there is 
anything like that left in Texas. We will probably drop in this  house.
?
Pretty quiet here all things considered.
?
Drop me a line or give me a call when you have some time. Or  if you are 
really free we could actually plan a lunch. The price of natural gas  should 
help keep Tom from hassling you too much.
?
Ken

Once this is fixed in SAP I will be able to change it in PEP.  The Data 
Integrity Team is being really strict on the name field.  It has to be 
changed in SAP before I am allowed to change it in PEP.  Please let me know 
when this has been done and I will make the change asap.

is it possible that his first name show as "J Darren" ?   Daren is his middle 
name and the name that everyone addresses him by.    
We would also be glad to submit the change in SAP if the system will accept J 
Darren as the first name.
Please advise. 
Thanks for your help, hgm

Hello Again,

My Monthly Newsletter is attached. Please read it and let me
know your comments.

According to a survey taken by HomeGain, homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects. The survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $80 to $2,800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells. The biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening, which typicall costs
about $80-$100 and gives an average return of 769% on the
sale price. Other big winners were cleaning and
de-cluttering (cost=$305-$339;; return=594%), landscaping
and trimming (cost $432-$506; return=266%), and fixing,
plumbing and electrical (cost $338-$381; return=196%).

Here is the link to my October newsletter:

Hey guys and girls, there are three things you need  to announce tomorrow 
night at NEON.
?
??? 1)??? Get a count  of the kids in your group who need to go to the 
retreat late.? There is a  van leaving later Friday night, due to a several 
kids who are participating in a  Northland basketball game.? There is only 
one van, and priority will be for  the kids playing and girls cheering.? Get 
a count of those who need to go  late (it might even be good to get their 
names).? You can email this  information to beckyp@bammel.org
??? 2)???? The  toilet bowl will be at the NCS field at 2:00, unless the 
field is wet, and then  it will be moved to the Strack Middle school field.
??? 3)??? There will  be a superbowl party at Scott Simpson's home starting 
at 5:30.? Girls bring  sweets, guys bring chips and dips.
?
It looks like a busy weekend for the kids!?  Have a great NEON.
?
Bobby

The message below was sent Friday afternoon and came back with an incorrect 
address. Merry gave me the corrected e-mail address shown above.

New developments. Merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has now 
been named. He is Brandon Aaron Byington

Hi there, Darren & Tonya,

Merry and Doc had their new baby at 9:26 AM yesterday. No name yet. They are 
still trying to settle on one, so in the mean time, I'm just calling him "New 
Child" Byington.

He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4" long. Merry, Doc, and "New Child" are 
doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery (C section) so he says 
he was a bit shakey there a time or two.

Here are some digital camera pics I took when "N. C." was less thasn an hour 
old.

Damn!!!! What are you guys doing down  there. I leave you alone and the place goes to hell in a  hand-basket.
 
I'm sure glad my portfolio is diversified  into stocks that have lost even more money than Enron (chuckle).
 
Hang in there ......... this has happened  before. If it gets bad enough call me and I'll buy you lunch.
 
Ken
 
P.S. I finally get to see my beloved  Huskers in Waco this year. It is not the same as Mecca (Lincoln), but it'll do.  Besides we will have more red there than Baylor  green.

Try 713-839-0573 (home), but more likely: 713-557-4869 (cell), and just to be 
clear O'neal and I are the "assault" part of the team, not the "Aggie" part.

I'll now be including Gayla on these e-mails because she has agreed to
write
brief profiles of each new family for the bulletin.

Here are the First Friends candidates from this week (please remember to
tell me what assignments you made so I can track that with my new member
data - Thanks!)

Jeanna Bent
8002 Fonthill Dr
Spring, TX  77379
281-376-4470
(Champion Oaks)

Michael and Jeanna are both CPA's.  They have a 7-year-old son named
Mason.
Michael's company will be relocating to New Hamphsire in the fall, but he
does not want to move, so he will be looking for a new job soon.  Michael
was just baptized two weeks ago after studying with Gerald Bendele.  He
was
raised in a Catholic background.  I believe Jeanna has been a Christian
for
some time.


Sandra Caballero
19707 Rackingham
Humble, TX  77338
281-540-2331

Don & Sandra are transferring membership from Hidden Valley C of C.
Prior
to that they attended Katy for several years.  Don works at Compaq and
Sandra is at Clark Electric and Spring ISD.  They have a 16 year old son
named Daniel at Spring H.S. and an 18 year old daughter named Amanda at
North Harris Community College.

Vickie Gonsoulin
15718 Falling Creek
Houston, TX  77068

Vickie and Bill are transferring from the Magnolia church.  They have a
son
named Dustin who is a junior in high school.  He participated with
Bammel's
LTC program even before they placed membership here.  They also have an
older, married son.  Bill grew up in this area.  In fact, Ron Anders was
his
football coach.

Once this is fixed in SAP I will be able to change it in PEP.  The Data 
Integrity Team is being really strict on the name field.  It has to be 
changed in SAP before I am allowed to change it in PEP.  Please let me know 
when this has been done and I will make the change asap.

is it possible that his first name show as "J Darren" ?   Daren is his middle 
name and the name that everyone addresses him by.    
We would also be glad to submit the change in SAP if the system will accept J 
Darren as the first name.
Please advise.

What's up team? Our game this week is as 6:00. Let me know who is going to be 
there. I would assume everyone will just leave and come back to run you 
books. The jersey's will be done and I will have them for you. They cost 
$25.00, so try and bring the cash Wed. Our shirts are black with red numbers, 
everyone please try and wear black shorts so if we play like shit we'll at 
least look good.

I'm sitting here a bit disappointed and pissed.

Do you and Pat honestly believe it is "one man's word against another" on 
setting up the link builder by the 12th of the month?

If so, why have I been saying something is wrong with some of the links for 
the last several days? And why did I work so late the first couple of days of 
each month setting up the links when I had so much time?

I'm not going to play this game with Mr. Lloyd. When he took the time to show 
up he was coached well in what was needed to be done, how to do it, and when 
to do it.

This situation was entirely predictable. It is always "I'm about to do it" 
and it is always an "I thought you said............." situation.

You know better. I won't be hung out again.

Whether you're investing for your kids' education or your retirement, the
new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach. The $1.35-trillion
tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas, from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes.

Many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years.
But to help you take advantage of all possible provisions, we should start
planning soon. Some of the ways you may benefit include:

Lower income tax rates. The gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun. In fact, the new withholding schedule went into effect on July 1.
And, you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new
10% bottom rate retroactive to January 1, 2001. As tax rates fall over the
next few years, your disposable income will likely rise - offering an
opportunity to invest more toward your various goals.

Education-funding incentives. Parents who want to help their children attend
college may now find their financial task easier. The tax relief act will
improve education savings tools such as:

? Education IRAs - The accounts' contribution limit will rise from $500 to
$2,000 in 2002. What's more, money in these accounts can now be used for
elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education
expenses.

? State sponsored 529 college savings plans - Also beginning in 2002,
distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax
free. Currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the
beneficiary's rate upon withdrawal. 529s are particularly attractive due to
their generous contribution limits.

? Deductions for education expenses - The act increases eligibility for
student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher
education expenses.

? The Child Tax Credit - Though not tied specifically to education expenses,
this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college.
Previously $500 per qualifying child under 17, the credit increases to $600
in 2001-2004, $700 in 2005-2008, $800 in 2009 and $1,000 in 2010 and
thereafter.

Higher retirement plan contribution limits. The tax act will allow people
with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and IRAs - possibly
helping them retire sooner and more comfortably. Your options may include:

? Traditional and Roth IRAs - Annual contribution limits for both of these
types of IRAs will gradually rise from $2,000 this year to $5,000 in 2008.
After that, the limits will be indexed to inflation in $500 increments.

? 401(k)s and 403(b)s - Working individuals also may be able to invest more
in their employer retirement plan. The limit on elective deferrals will
gradually rise from $10,500 this year to $15,000 in 2006, and this doesn't
include the catch-up contribution provision for people 50 years and older.

And much more. There are other provisions in the new tax law that may
benefit you and your family. When we meet, we'll identify the ones that
apply to you and help you make the most of them.

As you can see, the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number
of areas. But because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are
set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be
flexible enough to react to year-by-year changes.

Such planning is where American Express Financial Advisors excels. I'm
backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation, investments, estate
and retirement planning, and more to help you make the most of your
finances.

Let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you.

Hey!  What did the doctor say about Jake?  Did they run the tests?  I'm out
next week Wed.-Fri. for spring break.  I want to bring Lacy to see Jake.
When would be best?  Tonya said the weekends were taken for a while.Did she
mean Easter Weekend too?  Hope Jake is doing better. You never did send me
any videos of him & Cole so I could see if I could download them.  Love, Ma

HEY! Tonya said to staple copy B of the W-2 to the tax return--But on the
one from camp it says Copy C for payer or State Copy, Copy B for Recipient
(Keep for your records).  So which one do I send?  The one from the school
says send B but I'm confused on the other one.
What did the doctor say about Tonya & the due date? Love, Ma

As most of you have probably heard already, I am leaving Enron to pursue some 
new endeavors.  I will be moving back home to Toronto and I'm going to take 
some time off to do some travelling.  I plan to go back to school in January, 
and after that.... we'll see what life has in store!  

I wanted to thank all of you for the many wonderful experiences I have had 
here at Enron.  It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know you 
all.  I hope that if you're ever in Toronto you will drop me a line.

My last day of work will be June 30th, however, I will be staying in Houston 
until the end of July.  I hope to see or speak to all of you before I leave, 
but if I don't manage to, please keep in touch.  My e-mail address is 
jennifer_sabine@yahoo.com.

Take care and good luck!
Jennifer

Please respond to Hi, Just wanted to let you know that Lacy's sugar levels =
are staying up pretty well.  She was down to 51 this morning, but she took =
a shot last night & I guess she didn't eat enough ice cream.  She was mad a=
t me cause I didn't give her more than I did.  But it's so hard to know exa=
ctly how to handle it 'cause she's been going to bed a little high & gettin=
g up a little high.  But anyway, she's doing better & I guess she'll always=
 be mad & think I'm mistreating her.  I stay stressed out every day not kno=
wing if she got low after I left & passed out & no one would know it.  I'm =
going to try to get a cell phone & have her call me when she gets there--I =
think--I don't know--she'll be mad about that too.  But the other night, sh=
e didn't eat right after she took her shot, then didn't eat anything fast a=
cting & got in the truck to go over to Phillip's to get research info from =
his computer, got low & had to pull over & eat sugar tabs.  So that's what =
scares me.  She knew to eat righ!
t after she took that shot & didn't. But she was high before she took it & =
I guess she didn't think about it getting low. I don't know what will happe=
n to her when she leaves home.

But anyway, I wanted to let you know that we're going to Dallas to look for=
 the prom dress & shoes, don't know if we will stay all night or not. I hav=
en't talked to Shane & Shelley.  I wanted to stay & go to Saturn Rd. to chu=
rch & go to the singles class.  But I don't know what Shane & Shelley have =
planned.  So we'll be back either Sat. night or Sun. Lacy has to be back to=
 work on 3 research papers & projects that are all due at once.  So, wish u=
s luck.  Any donations will be appreciated!  I hear they're more than I was=
 expecting. But anyway, I don't intend to go overboard.  Maybe there will b=

Hope my grandsons are doing ok.  I bet they were glad that their Daddy got =

Good afternoon!

No, this isn't a new tip - just a follow-up on the one I sent this
morning. I received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them 
along.

Kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm, except for one thing:
he's had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the
base, so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect. I referred to this
briefly at the end of the tip, but here's a quick solution for avoiding
the problem.

Before routing the dado in the gauge, first mark a point on the base of
your router. (I simply add a piece of masking tape since it's easy to
see.) Then when routing the gauge (and later, the panel), always keep
this mark against the straightedge. Your dadoes should be right on.

Another email came in from Mike, who suggested making two alignment
gauges. Then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you
clamp the straightedge fence down. This prevents the "wiggling" that
often occurs when one end is clamped before the other. Great tip!

A big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions. It's great to
hear that so many people are enjoying the tips.

Talk to you again in a few weeks.

Hi,
?
Am I to understand that not a single team in my adopted state  won a bowl 
game? 
?
I guess I will stay loyal to the CORNHUSKERS as they seemed to  handle being 
pissed off about not playing in a better bowl. We need more meat  than the 
big 10 can throw out.
?
Well now it is down to next year again.....................  
?
Did Cole get enough trucks from Santa ..................... or  did Jake eat 
them? I'm sure it was fun.
?

Gentlemen....the time has come to send Gary off into the great unknown of
wedded bliss!!!


My name is Jeff Jackson, I grew up with the Whammer!!!!!

I would appreciate if you guys could let me know ASAP if you can attend his
bachelor party on Saturday Feb. 3. We need to get a head count so we can
determine costs and accomodations if necessary.

Location: Houston

We will start out with some mudbugs and beer....

The plan is to charter a party bus to take care of us that
evening.....wherever we might end up.

If anyone is interested in hotel accomidations please indicate in your
email, we will incoprorate that into our plans. Any ideas, for something to
do between mudbugs and late night carousing....bring 'em on  (ie.....horse
races, go carts........etc.

Also, as an alternative to staying in Houston, Gary and i thought about
taking a bus  and spending Saturday and Saturady night in Lake Charles,
gambling and........

Again..Please As soon as possible send a reply if you are going and any
suggestions will help.

thanks

Jeff Jackson

Daren,

Thinking about Robert's little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling 
the marketing (Sitara) function back to your side of the fence I think a 
strong case could be made in favor of that idea.

It is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets, pathing, 
nominating, and confirming the Industrials. This dissipates the knowledge 
base and the responsibility factor. It is a "Who's on First" issue.

If the responsibility to ensure pricing, volume, and accomplishment of market 
intent is accurately depicted, and in Sitara, is in your shop then the 
schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of Unify and 
POPS. I'm sure this would help volume management and client services 
immensely.

As the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and 
more of the marketing function (Sitara) to the scheduling group in the hopes 
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture.

I believe the current situation is too much, too fast, for scheduling to 
handle all at once. It has also created a situation where Robert seems to 
think not only that he has all the segments mastered, but that he is the only 
person that should be involved in the Industrials.

I will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue, but if you 
and Pat leave things the way they are please explain to both Robert and Pat 
that others may be involved in the Industrial activity and that is quite 
alright.

Once again, thanks for listening.

Ken

I believe the boat is 18 to 19 ft long and I do have a boat cover.  I will 
bring the boat information with me tomorrow for anymore questions.  I 
recently took it to the shop to get it ready for this season and the salesman 
said it looked brand new.  It has a brand new battery and everything runs 
perfectly.  Call me if you want to take a look at it.
