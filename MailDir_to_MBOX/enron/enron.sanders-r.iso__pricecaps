FYI

Governor Davis is asking the California Attorney General to expand his
investigation to include civil and criminal violations that may have
occurred in relation to the pricing of natural gas. He has asked that this 
investigation include coordination with federal authorities to determine if 
violations of the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act have occurred.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 December 15, 2000


        GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL
                                   ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION



SACRAMENTO -- In response to actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission on Friday, Governor Gray Davis issued the following statement:

"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has abdicated its responsibility
to the people in the West. Their responsibility is to ensure just and
reasonable rates. Instead,
they have chosen to ensure unconscionable profits for the pirate generators
and power brokers who are gouging California consumers and businesses.

"Make no mistake: By its unwarranted actions today, FERC itself has
substantially raised consumer electricity rates in California. I urge the
Public Utilities Commission
to take all appropriate action to cushion the impact of this FERC-provoked
rate increase. But by refusing to impose regional price caps and by seeking
to deny California
control over the Independent System Operator, FERC has sided against
California consumers and businesses.

"This is an inexplicable decision by armchair Washington bureaucrats fixated
on economic ideology that has no practical application to the dysfunctional
energy market in
California and the West. Instead of acting in the best interests of
consumers and businesses, the FERC commissioners have acted as pawns of
generators and power
sellers whose only interest is to plunder our economy.

"FERC's failure to act in the interest of our consumers and businesses
literally invites California to act to regain control over the energy
market. Given this decision
California now must move forward on both legal and legislative fronts to
assure stabilization, generation and conservation.

"Although we had hoped FERC would shoulder its responsibility, we have not
stood by idly waiting for them to rescue California. Already we have taken
the first steps
by encouraging the construction of new generation in California.

"The Energy Commission has approved eight new power plants since April 1999.
Another is on the agenda for action next week. Twenty-two more applications
are
pending and the Governor's Green Team is working to accelerate permitting.

"We're working closely with the California Air Resources Board and local air
districts to find solutions to emissions problems. Last week, we were able
to put 2,000
megawatts of power back on-line to help us through the current crisis. And
we'll do more.

"We've refocused long-idle energy conservation programs to save electricity,
and we've added $50 million from the State's General Fund to get
conservation programs
online by this summer. The State, under the guidance of the Secretary of the
State and Consumer Services Agency and the Department of Water Resources has
been
contributing up to 1,300 megawatts-a-day to the conservation efforts of
consumers and businesses throughout the state. Large industrial users have
borne a particularly
heavy burden through their interruptible contracts.

"Now, in response to FERC's failure to meet its obligations, I will call the
California Legislature into concurrent Special Session to do at least the
following:

               Replace the so-called stakeholders on the ISO Board with
Californians who are more concerned about the prices consumers
               and businesses pay for power than they are about the profits
their companies make.

               Re-establish the authority for the state to inspect private
power plants to assure the coordination of maintenance and operating
               schedules. (Last week alone more than 11,000 megawatts of
power were off-line with half of that in "unscheduled outages.")

               Provide low-interest financing for new peaking facilities or
re-powering old ones to make them cleaner and more efficient in
               return for committing their power to Californians at
guaranteed low rates.

"We also need to work together to conserve energy. We must quickly develop
programs that large industrial and commercial companies can participate in
that are
reasonable and predictable.

"We must redouble our efforts to educate and involve consumers in
conservation efforts that will save energy and money.

"I will be reserving $1 billion in my January 2001-02 budget for these
purposes.

"We also must ensure that there is enough electricity generation built in
California to get us through the current crisis and to allow the continuing
growth of our economy.

"We need to continue the efforts started under AB 970 through the Governor's
Green Team to site new generation, and to re-power old, dirty power plants
with new
cleaner, more efficient equipment. Making a dirty power plant clean can also
improve its efficiency by 40 percent.

"We need to explore new opportunities to produce power through the
Department of Water and Power. (Hydroelectric power generated by the State
Water Project has
helped us through the crisis of the last few weeks.)

"And we need to encourage the development of co-generation and distributed
generation for businesses throughout California.

"Finally, we need to find a way to stabilize electricity rates for all
Californians that does not bankrupt our utilities, but at the same time
keeps the pressure on the utilities
and the pirate generators and power brokers to keep prices down. There will
be pain, but everyone must share that pain.

"A critical step to making this happen is to stop the bleeding that is
occurring even today as the greed of the generators and marketeers threatens
our economy.

"Toward that end, I am asking the Attorney General to expand his
investigation to include civil and criminal violations that may have
occurred in relation to operations
practices of the generators and the pricing of natural gas. This
investigation should include coordination with federal authorities to
determine if violations of the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act have occurred.

"The public health and safety of California's citizens and the economy of
the State cannot be subject to the blackmail of a few greedy privateers
working in concert with
a handful of Washington bureaucrats.

"FERC has shirked its duty to the people and businesses of California. I
will not allow our state to be victimized by unfettered marketers. I will do
whatever it takes to
protect the economy and security of the people of California."

Subject: Response to ISO Dispatch Orders


As of noon EST, the DOE still had not issued any order under section 202(c).
Thus, at least for now, Enron's obligations are a function of the ISO Tariff
and the Participating Generator Agreement.   Last Friday, the ISO filed with
FERC Amendment No. 33 to its tariff.  Among other things, the Amendment adds
to the section 5 of the  tariff  new provisions empowering the ISO to assess
a penalty against Participating Generators that refuse to operate in
response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when
the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency.   The
penalty is stiff:  (1) a charge for each MWh of the Dispatch instruction
with which the Participating Generator does not comply equal to twice the
highest price for Energy, per MWh, paid in each hour by the ISO to any other
entity to produce Energy; and (2) if the ISO is required t call for the
involuntary curtailment of firm Load to maintain Applicable Reliability
Criteria during the System Emergency, then an additional charge equal to
$1,000 for each MWh of the Dispatch instruction with which the Participating
Generator does not comply.  The only defense to these penalties is to
provide proof that the generating unit in question was physically incapable
of running or it would have violated state or federal law to run it (e.g.,
air emission allowance limits).  The ISO asked FERC for an immediate
effective date of December 8, which FERC granted in a December 8 order.

 The ISO Tariff defines "Participating Seller or Generator" to mean  "A
generator or other seller of Energy or Ancillary Services through a
Scheduling Coordinator over the ISO Controlled Grid and which has undertaken
to be bound by the terms of the ISO Tariff."  If Enron is a Participating
Generator (Mary Hain informs me that Enron is not one), then it risks
incurring the new penalty if it fails to respond to an ISO order to sell
ancillary services to  the ISO.  I believe Enron might also risk incurring
the penalty in cases where it controls or has rights to all or a portion of
a generating capacity of a Participating Generator's unit.  If that capacity
is called on and the call is not answered because Enron is making some other
use of the capacity, the Enron may incur the penalty .  This seems to be
contemplated by section 4.1.1 of the Participating Generator Agreement which
obliges a Participating Generator to comply with the tariff (section 5.3) by
identifying the Generating Units that it owns, operates or has a contractual
entitlement to in Schedule 1, as required by Section 5.3 of the ISO Tariff.
(emphasis added).   As far as I know, it is that Schedule 1 that the ISO
consults when making decisions as to which Participating Generator to call
on.

I will forward to you Secretary Richardson's order as soon as it is issued.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Jeff, Bill,

Per your request, attached is a spreadsheet which details counterparty 
exposure in the West region.  The spreadsheet contains several tabs which 
detail each the Physical MTM and Financial MTM exposure.  Please be sure you 
are looking at the correct spreadsheets.  Also, these exposure amounts do not 
reflect the overall exposure with each counterparty, just the exposure for 
the West region.

Thanks
Russell

Subject: Mirant Delta, LLC, et al. v. Cal ISO, EL01-35
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="=_4219F1AE.E485EA5C"

On Feb. 6, 2001, Mirant Delta, LLC and Mirant Potrero, LLC filed a complaint 
against the Cal ISO in Docket No. EL01-35-000, which has been attached.  In 
the complaint, Mirant alleges that the ISO is violating the Federal Power Act 
and prior FERC orders through (1) waiving the applicable credit requirements 
for the IOUs prior to FERC approval (particularly in light of the ISO's 
inability to pay suppliers for energy provided); (2) failing to pursue all 
available remedies against defaulting parties; and (3) seating a 
non-independent governance board.

The relief sought by Mirant is as follows:  (1) that it be required to sell 
wholesale power only on commercially reasonable terms that provide for 
adequate assurances of payment; (2) that FERC order the ISO not to change its 
rates unilaterally in violation of the Filed Rate Doctrine; and (3) that FERC 
require the ISO adhere to the specific provisions of its tariff and FERC 
orders.

Mirant has requested fast track processing for this complaint.  It appears 
that FERC is granting this request; FERC noticed the complaint on Feb. 8, and 
established Feb. 26 as the due date for interventions/protests and answers.

Attached is my interpretation of what we should be providing in response to 
Request No. 20 based on the series of e-mails that Mary sent earlier this 
week.  There is a word doc and several associated excel spreadsheets.   Note 
that at least one of the excel spreadsheets actually contains multiple sheets.

Mary--it would be helpful if you could review this data in this form and let 
the team know if it is the right info to be providing the CPUC in response to 
No. 20.  I don't think this info should be sent until Mary has had a chance 
to review it and approve.

In the Room

PG&E presented its "Share the Pain" proposal:
 --  Each party allocated a share of the utilities' unmet load (4,000 MW of 
PG&E and 8,000 MW for SCE)
 --  Allocation based on the volume of sales made to ISO and PX in 3rd and 
4rth Q of 2000 (% of total)
  and "profits" received.  "Profit" allocation would be returned as discounts 
to the utilities for 2001
  and 2002. Judge would determine whether allocation of "profit" was fair for 
each party.
 --  Those who participate retain market-based rates for all other sales.
 --  Those who don't .......?  Not clear what can happen.  PG&E suggested 
lose market power license,
  which was very negatively received by all marketers.
 --  PG&E says go along because otherwise we won't pay you the $2 billion we 
owe right now.
Enron responded publicly that it wants to work in this process and be 
positive, but utilities would need to
 provide MAJOR quid pro quo for this, such as release from legal liability 
and auctioning off retail load --  and how does this work with so many 
parties missing from the room (i.e., Governor, CPUC, Legislature,  BPA, 
PowerEX, etc.)
Marketers met separately with the Judge. Avista, Morgan Stanley, PG&E 
National Energy Group, Strategic Energy, BP, Merrill Lynch. Explained that 
PG&E's offer did not work for marketers -- no owned assets, can't have 
obligation to buy in the market and sell to the utilities at a loss. We point 
out that we did not come in good faith to "write a check" -- that was not the 
stated intent of the discussions

Out of the Room

More talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators; SCE still on 
the sidelines.
Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs and gens for two hours.
Reporters hover at door and try to get info from those coming and going.

Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Again

Judge annuounces the generators are working on spreadsheets to come up with 
the dollars for a workable proposal. Asks people to return Friday, 10:00 am.  
Does not address how this proposal would effect marketers -- tells us to talk 
to the generators.
Announces that he intends to "send a signal to the financial markets 
tomorrow." He seems to want to take these unusual steps in spite of these 
confidential settlement discussions -- to help the utilities and as he said, 
"buy us some time."
Judge asks ISO and PX to provide the name of each Scheduling Coordinator 
selling to the ISO and PX markets and the amount sold by each.  Goal-- to 
find  out who has what market share (and, I suspect, later, the biggest 
chunck of "profits') Don't know how long this will take.  I suggest two weeks.
Judge says when he gets this info, he will know what other parties to 
"encourage" to be in the room.

Discussions with Reliant

John Stout from Reliant seems to be taking the lead for the gens.
John understands that Power EX and BPA will not sell to California below 
market.  He understands that marketers have the same problem.
He claims to be working toward the buckets I mentioned yesterday -- so some 
people sell at market and some have lower-priced (and I presume 
longer-termed) forward contracts. He promises to have something to share 
(with all the parties) tomorrow at 10 am.
John wants for us all to reach some agreement on Friday and be able to say to 
Governor Davis that we have solved the wholesale price problem long-term -- 
but to make this work, you need to raise retail rates by an additional  X% 
(he thinks another half a cent might do it). Then Governor Davis can 
incorporate this into his State of the State address on January 8.
Stay tuned.

Bob:

Pursuant to our discussions, attached is a brief listing of some of the pros 
and cons we talked about regarding the Negative CTC.  This is not all 
inclusive, but I thought it would assist our discussions.

The arguments here focus solely on legal ones.  It does not address the 
policy issues/considerations that the Negative CTCs obviously raise.

I have copied those shown as "CCs".  Could you forward to anyone else who 
should receive this.

I appreciate your quick response.  Yes, we would like response to question 8 
for the WSCC only.  Thank yor the names at Enron Wind.  I will contact them 
shortly.  Other team members have reviewed your responses, but I have not got 
a l chance to look at them in detail.  I plan to do this today.  As a resutl, 
I may have further questions or data needs depending upon what was provided.  
Please call me at 202-208-2493 if you need anything.

>>> <Mary.Hain@enron.com> 09/14/00 08:06PM >>>

Since you only wanted information for the WSCC, do you want the answer to
number 8 to be corrected to only include information for the WSCC?

We don't have any information here about Enron Winds' generators.  I have
forwarded your data requests to the following people at Enron Wind who I
hope will be able to help you:  John Lamb, Michael Payne, and Hap Boyd.
Their addresses are: Michael Payne/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Hap
Boyd/EWC/Enron@Enron, John Lamb/EWC/Enron@ENRON

Thank you for your timely response to FERC's data request.  To date, I have
received responses to questions 2-8.  The only oustanding items are
responses to question #1 and a portion of #4 (unit identifier).  It is
understood that the responses for #1 will be availalbe after September 15
and the additional information for #4 will be available this week.  We will
look over your responses and call you if clarification or additional
information is necessary.  We will treat as you requested #2, 3, 4, 6, and
8 as Confidential.

You were correct is responding only to the WSCC.  We did not purovidea
separate data requests to Enron Wind.  In not doing so, what information
are we missing from our data requests?  Please e-mail me a response to this
questions.  For any other concerns please continue to use e-mail or contact
me at 202-208-2493.

Here is a link to the FERC order issued on Friday requiring refunds for the
month of Jan. 2001.  In light of this order, Greg Copeland has suggested
that we consider supplementing our San Diego remand briefs and referencing
the order in our remand oppositions in San Francisco.  Let's discuss on
tomorrow's call.

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  
The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of 
electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and 
constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to 
sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on 
or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted 
their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is 
presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  
Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

>  Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number

> served on the Enron entities.  First, we understand that many other
> parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the
> detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very
> sound legal grounds.  Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing
> on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is
> supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes
> sought by other parties served.  Third, the Commission has filed its
> motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data
> from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited
> hearing and production schedule.  We note that the reasons stated in the
> motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially
> different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application
> to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.
> Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a

>  Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept "most

I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last week's trade press.

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO "backpedal" statements made re: claims of strategic bidding would apply equally to other importers.

Tim,
 Here is the email you should send out with respect to retention of
hard copies of documents.
IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY
 REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
_____ who can arrange for storage.

2. What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy
and you may do with them as you wish.



Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.

Thanks
Gary

Few escape blame for crisis in poll
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published May 24, 2001)=20
Utility companies and out-of-state power generators continue to get the=20
lowest marks for their performance in California's energy crisis, but Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months,=20
according to a Field Poll released Wednesday.=20
And Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's powe=
r=20
woes -- except themselves.=20
Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except "residential energy=
=20
consumers," which 39 percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or ve=
ry=20
good job to improve the energy situation. Only 22 percent think they are=20
doing a poor or very poor job.=20
Public opinion of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January=
,=20
when 32 percent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave=
=20
them high marks.=20
"The public sees themselves as conserving energy," said Field Poll Director=
=20
Mark DiCamillo. "That's the only positive movement in the survey."=20
For Davis, who faces re-election next year, the movement is far from=20
positive.=20
In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from 41=20
percent of those surveyed, average grades from 31 percent and poor ratings=
=20
from only 22 percent.=20
But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May 11 and=
=20
Sunday, opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After months of energy angst, a=
=20
handful of power blackouts and two rate increases, only 27 percent think=20
Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave him failing grades. The po=
ll=20
also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average=
=20
of a year and a half, well through the upcoming re-election battle.=20
"All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not goin=
g=20
over well any more," DiCamillo said. "The public is starting to view this a=
s=20
a long-term problem, not some temporary policy shift."=20
Still, Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- Preside=
nt=20
Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry.=20
The public's view of energy interests, which was pretty dim in January, dro=
ps=20
even lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from hal=
f=20
the public in January, but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or=
=20
very poor job. Out-of-state energy generators, whom Davis has accused of=20
gouging ratepayers, fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 perce=
nt=20
in the May poll.=20
Bush, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utiliti=
es=20
Commission are not far behind, drawing poor grades from more than half the=
=20
public. Cheney, the architect of Bush's energy proposal, received low ratin=
gs=20
from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney=
=20
because they had not yet taken office.=20
Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on=
=20
electricity, and has called Cheney "grossly misinformed" on the state's=20
energy problems. Cheney, in turn, has called Davis' energy proposals=20
"harebrained" and "goofy."=20
The state Legislature receives poor marks from 41 percent of those polled,=

New views emerging on power
More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau=20
(Published May 23, 2001)

If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when =
to=20
break out the candles or send the workers home.=20
That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and=
=20
giving businesses and residents ample warning.=20
On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer=20
public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the Californ=
ia=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid.=20
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a=
=20
blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the=20
possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light=
s=20
would stay on.=20
Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which "ever=
y=20
day is a potential blackout day."=20
A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a=20
strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the=
=20
state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask=20
Washington and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel."=20
If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state woul=
d=20
gut it out with planned blackouts.=20
"Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michael Shames, head of t=
he=20
San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utiliti=
es=20
and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for=
=20
warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes.=20
"Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel=
=20
could work," Shames said.=20
On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about th=
e=20
city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power=20
blackouts, with definite notice right before.=20
"There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i=
s=20
likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said =
he=20
plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea=
=20
of a system like Chicago's.=20
The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at=
=20
least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the=20
public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will g=
o=20
beyond ISO's.=20
There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking=
=20
advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts=
=20
might increase the number of outages.=20
If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute=20
supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to=20
decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the=
=20
California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=20
If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibl=
y=20
leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.=20
"Obviously, there are trade-offs," Rothrock said.=20
Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f=
or=20
the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in=
=20
recent months.=20
"It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush,=
=20
we're going to handle this ourselves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove=
.=20
Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo=
ne=20
who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier.=
=20
Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food=
=20
processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go.=20
Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day th=
at=20
their electronic gates might be closed.=20
Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange fo=
r=20
backup power generators, he said.=20
"We would be very interested in it," said Ed Yates, senior vice president o=
f=20
the California League of Food Processors.=20
Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring so=
me=20
plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day=
.=20
Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, h=
e=20
said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food.=
=20
"It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult=20
situation," he said.=20
Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two=
=20
weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have =
to=20
turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went abo=
ve=20
that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.=
=20
One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when=
=20
blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora=
ry=20
stop signs at road intersections, or families being able to arrange for a=

sick relative to be moved.=20
"If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult=
=20
intersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departmen=
ts=20
and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said.=20
The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed t=
he=20
idea yet, but say it's worth a look.=20
"It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothrock said.=20

Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't s=

electricity north of the border.=20
"Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in Californ=

after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin American=

Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most=20
immediate solutions to California's electricity shortfalls. At least three=
=20
plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send=20
electricity north of the border, where blackouts have interrupted normal=20
activity.=20
One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. power plant near Mexicali, will export=
=20
all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border. The San Dieg=
o=20
company's project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because th=
e=20
facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that=
=20
supply electricity to the Mexican market.=20
Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are=20
interested in building similar facilities in Baja California.=20
Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the=20
border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and=
=20
public health and safety.=20
In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to preserving the=20
environment and local communities.=20
But afterward, he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California=20
projects to serve California consumers.=20
"I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of the interconnectin=
g=20
lines to transmit the electricity that is produced," he said.=20
With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission=20
interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja=20
California will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of=20
electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California=
=20
plants -- let alone any additional facilities.=20
Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary owns both the=20
interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali,=
=20
spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvement will transmit=20
electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the company substatio=
n=20
in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana.=20
Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building Baja California=
=20
plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives of the firms cou=
ld=20
not be reached yesterday.=20
Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border, the=
=20
California grid system presents another obstacle.=20
To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California=
=20
grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has fo=
r=20
transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the servic=
e.=20
"It's become very important because of our proximity to Mexico," said=20
district spokesman Ron Hull.=20
The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant=20
construction in Baja California. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the=
=20
facilities.=20
Sempra again is a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja=

pipeline won't provide fuel for any other facilities.=20
"It's fully subscribed," said Clark. "In the future if there is enough=20
demand, the compression could be increased."=20
Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natural=

alternatives to power sources.=20
That's the only thing we can do in the short term.=20
In the long term, you can almost see what will be coming down the pike.=20

state, someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the=

It will do two things.=20
First, it will undo the deregulation of the state's energy industry. It wil=

try to put everything back the way it was.=20
Second, it will punish the producers of power and energy.=20
It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ=
ic=20
utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely.=
=20
Huge amounts of money will be spent against it. Opponents will outspend=20
supporters by a substantial amount.=20
TV ads will run constantly, predicting dire consequences if the initiative =
is=20
approved.=20
We'll be told it will be bad for business. Labor leaders will tell us that =
it=20
will cost jobs. Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem, or=
=20
make the problem worse.=20
All of that will probably be true.=20
The initiative will pass easily.=20
It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a=
s=20
the two main causes of the current energy crisis -- a badly bungled=20
deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers.=20
It will pass because the initiative's authors will understand that most of =
us=20
are furious about the way this mess was created and that we're eager to tak=
e=20
it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains.=20
It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldn't=

political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo=

the problem -- such as the state Legislature and Gov. Davis, who could have=
=20
done something about this a year ago and chose not to.=20
Yes, the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi=

and the Legislature.=20
But elections for office are not yes/no propositions -- you don't get to vo=
te=20

They are a contest between two major party candidates, which means election=
s=20
are always a matter of comparisons -- Davis compared with his opponent.=20
Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bett=
er=20
than Davis.=20
There might, indeed, be such people. It's unlikely one of those people will=
=20
appear on the ballot in 2002, however.=20
The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in=20
discouragement -- people who, fearful of losing, lack the nerve to run=20
against a well-financed incumbent.=20
The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that=20
problem -- rather than being stuck with a well-financed incumbent, we'd for=
ce=20
him out of office.=20
In reality, we're stuck with the well-financed incumbent until his term=20
limits are up -- in six or eight years.=20
That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to=20
eight years. It has done nothing to embolden would-be candidates. Now, they=
=20
just meekly wait their turn.=20
And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the=20
Capitol with people who don't know what they're doing, only where they're=
=20
going next. Meanwhile, the people who do know what they're doing have been=

things that will happen in the future.=20
Right now, it's time to tune in, turn off and drop out.=20

switching off some lights, converting to fluorescent light bulbs, turning=

that they truly are turned off.=20

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring=

that Californians be given at least one hour's notice before blackouts hit,=
=20
according to a top administration official.=20
The one-hour notice is double what the California Independent System=20

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has=20
handled the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their=20
energy doghouse, a Field Poll shows.=20
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush=
=20
and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey.=20
"Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings=
"=20
when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are=20
handling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the=
=20
Field Poll.=20
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent rating=
s=20
skidding for anyone connected with the energy business.=20
"Everyone has gotten tarred," DiCamillo said.=20
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or ve=
ry=20
poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers ranked=
=20
almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very poor=
=20
category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
to the same level.=20
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked=
=20
with the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are=20
supported by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said.=20
"To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue=
,=20
" he said, "I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal.=
"=20
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect=
=20
the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are=20
indications that that strategy may not work forever.=20
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job=
=20
with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new=
=20
survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jump=
ed=20
to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January.=20
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It=
=20
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.=20
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their=
=20
own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe=
=20
residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding t=
o=20
the problem, up from 26 percent in January.=20
"People think they're making an effort to conserve," DiCamillo said. "In th=
e=20
public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be=20
doing."=20
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousne=
ss=20
of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or mor=
e=20
before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced it=
=20
will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity.=20
"The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for=
 a=20
long haul," DiCamillo said. "The state hasn't been able to fix the problem =
in=20
a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen."=20
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that=
=20
PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to=
=20
its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if=20
businesses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts=
.=20
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state,=20
DiCamillo said.=20
"This is recognized as a major statewide issue," he said. "People think it=

will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live."=20

Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdin=
gs,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi=
ng
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewate=
r
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. Th=
e
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


"The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region," said Curt Hildebrand, vice president a=
nd
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  "We look forward=
 to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center."


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


"We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,"
Hildebrand added.  "We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible."


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the officia=
l
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental an=
d
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops =
and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  =

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gra=
y
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving=20
construction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

"California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapo=
n=20
is
to build more power plants," Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natu=
ral
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which ha=
s
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than=
=20
they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants an=
d=20
the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax=
=20
money
so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them.


Among other measures to ease the power shortage, the state government has=
=20
called
for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can, especially durin=
g=20
the
peak-hours during the day.Residents have been told to brace for a worse
situation during the incoming summer.

Status Report:

I spoke with Harvey Morris and the negotiation for an extension of time will
take place Friday morning.  He warned me not to expect 6 weeks, as that time
was required to negotiate and produce a protective order/confidentiality
agreement with the generators who received the first subpoenas.  He did
acknowledge that an extension was required, but made two points:  first,
that the staff is under tremendous pressure to hurry its investigation, and
secondly, that providing a partial response to requests that can be
accomodated quickly will be greatly appreciated "as a show of good faith".
He also indicated that the most recent batch of subpoenas went to almost 120
parties.

I will try to get as much of the 6 weeks as I can.  It would assist me if
representatives of EES and EPMI could scan the requests to see if, in fact,
there are items which could be provided in a shorter time frame and which
would not raise concerns about the disclosure of commercially sensitive
information.  I would like to be able to bargain for more time by offering
some information in the near term....if the strategy is to be give what we
can and strongly resist the most sensitive information.

SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Mary,

As you requested, this e-mail is to report on the WPTF discussions on the 
CPUC subpoenas.

In a Board conference call today, the members discussed who had subpoenas and 
a bit about what they were doing to respond. New West received a subpoena,  
but not its parent Salt River.  APX did not receive one.  (Separately, I 
learned that New Energy hasn't found one yet, though its parent AES got one)

Joe Paul of Dynegy took the lead and said that the generators had been having 
a weekly conference call to coordinate.  They had negotiated with the CPUC to 
get the Protective Order that came out last week.  

I suggested that the people receiving last Friday's subpoenas work toether 
the same way.  Dan Douglas (WPTF's attorney) will send an e-mail out asking 
the interested members to contact me.

Joe said that the issues they have seen are:  whether to file a motion to 
quash, what jurisdiction the CPUC has, what information should be shared, as 
well as other PR and legal issues.  He felt that ESP and SC issues may be 
quite different from generaters and suggested we work together.  The 
Generators have already given some public data tothe CPUC.  He says Dynegy is 
likely to argue that this type of analysis should not be done by the CPUC, 
but by the Market Surveillance Committee or someone of that ilk.

I'll keep you posted as I learn more.

Progress

Working Group 1 (WG1) -- Forward Contracts
An interim report was prepared from the work done in the various subgroups 
(attached)
By tomorrow, will have the final ready for the "principals" meeting 
tentatively scheduled for Saturday.
Final will include draft RFP, very agressive schedule ending with contracts 
signed by 1/31/01, draft standard contract, utilities' unmet load projected 
for 15 years,  and description of four products: 24x7; 6x16; capacity with 
monthly take or pays; and swing capacity.
The group will likely recommend two simultaneous RFP processes: (1) Davis' 
proposal -- what term and volume will you give me for 5.5 cents; and (2) bids 
with their own pricing and terms to meet the utilities' needs. 

Working Group 2 (WG2) -- Utility Debt
Working on a forbearance agreement
No more information out of that group
Enron in attendence; Houston credit people on Friday.

QF Group
This group met for the first time Thursday evening.
Expected to try to negotiate less volatile (and lower) QF prices using 
long-term gas tolling agreements.

Status of Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

MAJOR ISSUE FROM WEDNESDAY:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they 
want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that 
this had been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a 
forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of 
the utilities. Rest of attendees oppose this approach.  No progress made.
Kind of Auction or RFP -- Seems to be resolved as discussed above. 
Absence of Any State Officials -- Continues to concern participants.  
Everyone standing firm that no deal can be struck without State buy-in and 
relief from litigation and investigations.

Next Steps

WG1 reconvenes at 9am Friday to finish its report and work products.
Apparent joint meeting with WG2 at 10:00 am.
QF Group reconvenes at 2pm
Treasury and others will assess whether Saturday meeting with "principals" 
(CEOs, Governore) should take place. Tentatively planned for 3:30 pm.

Subject:	[PRESSLIST] ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER ISSUES STATEMENT IN 
RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY
ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO PG&E DECISION 
TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

(SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Locker today released the following 
statement regarding Pacific Gas & Electric's decision to file for bankruptcy:

"The uncontrolled increase in electricity prices by generators and marketers 
has claimed another victim with the bankruptcy of one of California's oldest 
businesses. While this is a significant and unwelcome development, our team 
of bankruptcy litigators has been
preparing for several months to defend California taxpayers in the event of a 
utility bankruptcy. This morning, I spoke with a PG&E executive, and he 
personally assured me that the utility will honor its legal obligation to pay 
the state for its purchase of energy and
to repay its renewable energy supplier-creditors ("qualified facilities"). I 
am prepared to enforce those assurances in the courts to the extent 
necessary. Over the last several months, our state attorneys have fought hard 
in the courts to ensure that out-of-state
generators continue to deliver adequate electricity and natural gas supplies 
to Californians in spite of the precarious financial condition of the state's 
two major utilities. The health and safety of Californians and the future of 
our economy require that our state not be left holding the bag for greedy 
business decisions of generators, marketers and utilities. Justice requires 
that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the expense of 
Californians must pay back what they owe. I will use all the considerable 
resources of the law to help our policymakers keep the lights on and the 
bills affordable for every California home and business, to recover 
California tax and ratepayer dollars that have been illegally or unfairly 
taken, and to punish wrongdoers."

AWARD TO INFORMANTS

"It is possible that one or more members of the public can help with 
information, and if so, the financial reward to such a person or persons 
could be enormous. My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into 
whether energy providers have violated any laws. Over the last four years, 
state and local government agencies have spent billions of dollars in state 
and local taxpayer money to purchase electricity and natural gas. Under 
California false claims law, any person or corporation who obtains state 
taxpayer money by fraud or illegal acts is liable for financial penalties 
that can be as high as three times the actual losses. And anyone who provides 
information leading to the successful prosecution of a false claim action may 
be entitled to a percentage share in that award. Since billions of state 
dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant could potentially range 
from $50 million to the
hundreds of millions of dollars. I am asking any member of the public with 
personal knowledge of any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction 
in the California supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or 
electricity to contact my office immediately by calling: 1-800-952-5225 (w/in 
CA) or (916) 322-3360 (local or out of state), or e-mail the Attorney 
General's Energy Emergency Task Force at energywhistleblower@doj.ca.gov."

Richard --

Here is the FERC Order on California issues.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order 
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters 
and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their 
Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on 
this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding?

The committee had a lengthy conference call today.  Let me touch on key
topics.  First, the application to employ PriceWaterhouse is being
contested by both the debtor and the US trustee.  There was a meeting today
with the debtor to narrow differences.  The debtor will provide a list of
its key concerns and we'll see if we can deal with them.  The UST just
believes that there is too much of a chance of conflict between roles in
the two cases.  We'll be setting a hearing soon to get the issue resolved
on way or the other.  Second, PGE has sought broad discovery from PX not
only of individual participants' claims against PGE but also underlying
trading information.  PX contends that much of this information cannot be
disclosed under the tariffs.  For that reason, PX hasn't even kprovided
this information to its participants.  Eisenberg is opposing the discovery
for that reason as well as based on burden to the debtor.  The PX committee
feels that Montali will accomodate discovery, at least to some extent.
Therefore, in the meet and confer this afternoon, the committee probably
will support disclosure if (1) participants get whatever of their
information as is disclosed to PGE, (2) substantial limitations are imposed
on the parties that will have access to the information and the use to
which it can be put and (3) PGE reimburses PX for a part of the cost.  In
addition, the committee intends to file a motion in the PX case requesting
that the debtor be ordered to turn information over to individual
participants and to our accountants who will have the responsibility to
test numbers but not to make general disclosure of accounts of individual
participants.  Third, Howard Weg believes that without some agreement on
the chargeback issue, FERC will take a long time to rule on whether PX
should return collateral.  Accordingly, Weg wants the participants to come
to an agreement that for any specified period, shortfalls will be shared
prorata among participants.  I asked Weg to send an email out to committee
members describing in detail his proposal and the basis for it so that we
could discuss it in detail during our next call.  Fourth, the commandeering
matters are proceeding.  The committee will complete interviews of
prospective counsel next Monday.  In the meantime, the Victims Compensation
Claims Board should rule June 22.  A summary denial is expected.
Interestingly, only about 30% of the participants submitted claims to the
board.  PX's expert opinion was made available to the committee.  He fixes
the value of commandeered contracts at $1.060 billion minus $350 million of
contract prices for a loss of just under $700 million.  We are following up
to test these numbers.  The committee's counsel has been negotiating a
stipulation for relief from stay in the PGE case.  It's moving too slowly,
so our counsel is drafting a stay relief motion for our review.  No one
seems inclined to start a commandeering suit until relief is granted.
Fifth, our counsel is having second thoughts about a stipulation with
Edison that would address the bond, the force majeur litigation and related
matters.  The question that is under review is whether the proposed deal
could be unwound if SCE files its own cha;pter 11 case.  On force majeur,
Judge Montali apparently rejected PGE's argument on that point.  Sixth,
there is still no deal with the trade creditors' committee.  They want
about double the $4 million we're offering.  We expect any day a motion to
extend plan exclusivity by the debtor.  Seventh, we discussed some
committee representation issues.  The committee voted against adding Puget
Sound as a member.  The committee agreed that it represented those who had
claims based on the scheduling coordinator role performed by PX for ISO.
The committee discussed whether it represented IOU's and concluded that it
did if they were owed in their role as sellers to the PX.  Finally, the
next meeting was set at 10 pst on June 25.  Feel free to call if there are
questions.  Bob Nelson

I appeared at the hearing this morning; I haven't communicated to Richard Sanders.  The retention bonuses were approved, and the court entered the stipulation turning over litigation to the participants committee.  I was able to successfully withdraw our opposition to the retention bonus.  As an aside, Joe Eisenberg never did sign the stipulation; he orally agreed to it at the hearing.

One note - The court stepped back from its earlier statement that participant's are creditors of the estate like any other.  Judge Smith said her earlier statement was re a specific issue, and that participants might not be treated like ordinary creditors for all purposes, she hadn't fully considered that issue.  This was in response to the creditors committee argument that only the participants benefitted from the costs of the non-BR litigation, and trade creditors shouldn't bear those costs.  J. Smith didn't agree or disagree, but my reading of her comments is she was leaving that issue for another day, when the first fee app comes in.

Here's the significant details, sorry its lengthy but I wanted to be thorough:

1.  The Perot motion - the court granted the motion to reject the Perot contract; Perot withdrew its objection, as did the creditors committee, subject to the following additional terms:  Perot agreed to subordinate some of its claims to trade creditor's claims (not participant's).  This did not appear to affect Enron or participants much, if at all; Marc Cohen had agreed to this.

2.  Status report - nothing we didn't already know.  Next status report hearing is 11/15 at 10:30 am.

3.  Stipulation re Commandeering Litigation - SCE and Puget both withdrew their objections, as did the creditors committee.  This was approved, subject to the following (these aren't all going to be placed in an order - some were just comments agreed to by various parties ):

   a.  the participants committee agreed that its duty was to maximize recovery to the estate and participants (of course, we agree, or at least I thought we did)

   b.  the participants committee agreed that it will not take action (litigation) re the AIG bond for 30 days (I know there is significant activity going on to resolve this issue)

   c.  re potential conflicts of interest, no disposition of litigation is possible without approval of the court, after opportunity for objections (nothing more than is required by law anyway), and if an actual conflict arises, the committee will not pursue that litigation but instead defer to the CalPX estate;

   d.  the committe will provide copies of all pleadings to Puget;

   e.  re costs of such litigation, all fee applications are subject to court approval and objections, and according to the stipulation all costs will be paid first from any recoveries from this litigation

4.  Retention/Stay bonus - approved, subject to Sladoje taking only $425k (down from $492k), and Miller taking only 100% of base salary, down from 105%.

That was all.  Regards,  Dan

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of
the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

 Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy
Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the
burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars
of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
"family trees" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for
earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first
wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
"Transaction Documents") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which
information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings
regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell
generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,
do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to
produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.
We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other
information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a
significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that
time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort
will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on
the California wholesale market.

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the
Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Richard --

We are moving forward with pushing FERC as the "right" forum for the Civil 
Litigation.   I want to talk with you ASAP about this strategy - mainly to 
make sure that you realize the likelihood of success (not too optimistic 
about a complete victory).

Also, the key is to build the right set of allies in moving forward - we need 
Mirant and Reliant to carry as much if not more water on this fight - their 
access to right FERC staff and Commissioners is pretty good.

Also, want to talk with you about all of the FERC matters we have on-going.  

Thanks,

Jim

Thanks Mary.  The memo's dated July 3rd and says that the ISO intends to 
release the information on July 10th.  Presumably, the info's already been 
transmitted to the EOB.  Did we/do we intend to challenge?

Attorney Work Product

Here is my status report on today's activities:

Attorney General Investigation

 Mike Day, Enron's outside counsel that does work before the PUC
called me late tonight to tell me that he was contacted by another attorney
that has done work for Enron in the past.  This other attorney received a
call from the California State Attorney General's office, Richard Rothman
(phonetic) stating that the AG was going to be sending out preservation of
documents letters to market participants including Enron and that they were
going to be issuing subpoenas in the very near future.

 Some recipients of this email may not have been included on the list
that got copies of the subpoena requests to the California ISO and
California PX so I will duplicate them here.

Change of Venue Research by Peter Meringolo

 Here's preliminary analysis of change of venue:

 The court may change the venue of a trial "where there is reason to
believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein."  C.C.P. o 397(b).
The party requesting a change of venue must show actual "widespread"
prejudice "extending over a long period of time."  Nguyen v. Superior Court,
49 Cal. App. 4th 1781, 1791 (1996).  Whether such a showing has been made is
left to the discretion of the trial court.  Id.

 Case law provides little guidance regarding how much evidence is
enough for a party to show actual prejudice.  As Witkin states, this
"challenge is so vague and difficult to sustain."  3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure,
Actions, o 871 (4th ed. 1996).  In fact, a change of venue on these grounds
has been granted in very few reported cases, the most recent of which was in
1938.  See People v. Ocean Shore R.R., 24 Cal. App. 2d 420 (1938); San
Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co. v. Stevinson, 179 Cal. 533
(1919).

 Ocean Shore was an eminent domain proceeding against 32 defendant
land owners to acquire lands to build a state highway, one defendant's
motion for change of venue was granted.  People v. Ocean Shore R.R., 24 Cal.
App. 2d 420 (1938).  The defendant filed nearly 200 affidavits, which
referenced newspaper articles, reports from civic meetings, and statements
by citizens showing a widespread prejudice against the defendants and its
cause extending over a long period of years.  Id. at 427-28.  The Court
affirmed the trial court's discretion, noting that the affidavits show that
"it would at least make it extremely doubtful whether an impartial trial
could be had before a jury in that county."  Id. at 428.

 San Joaquin was a condemnation action for the use of waters of a
river for the benefit of landowners on the west side of the river.  San
Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co. v. Stevinson, 179 Cal. 533
(1919).  In that action, the defendant operated an irrigation system for the
benefit of the landowners on the east side of the river.  Plaintiff filed
one affidavit showing that the people on the east side of the river felt
widespread prejudice against plaintiff and people on the west side of the
river were disqualified as jurors because they were using defendant's
irrigation system.  Id. at 537-38.  Defendant filed 22 affidavits in
opposition.  According to the Court, "if numbers of affiants or of
affidavits were the determining factor in questions of this character the
defendant herein would have been entitled to prevail upon said motion; but .
. . this is not the rule."  Id. at 538.  Rather, the question is whether the
trial court abused its discretion, and the Court held that it did not.

 These cases are contrasted with two case reported since 1938 in
which change of venue motions were denied.  See Riverside County Flood
Control and Water Conservation Dist. v. Joseph W. Wolfskill Co., 147 Cal.
App. 2d 714 (1957); Nguyen v. Superior Court, 49 Cal. App. 4th 1781, 1791
(1996).

 Riverside County was an eminent domain proceeding, where plaintiff
was seeking to condemn property for the purposes of flood control.
Defendants moved for a change of venue by presenting evidence that the
advantages of the flood control project was widely publicized, the
newspapers portrayed defendants as trying to prevent flood controls, that
the cost of purchasing defendant's property was to come from county funds
and therefore every taxpayer was adverse to defendant.  147 Cal. App. 2d at
716.  Plaintiff's affidavit contradicted these facts.  The trial court
denied the motion, and this decision was affirmed on appeal.  Id. at 717.

 In Nguyen, the State brought a suit against business owners in order
to shut down a red light district in San Mateo.  The defendant businesses
moved for a change of venue.  Defendants' evidence consisted of two
newspaper articles reporting the raid on the businesses, that the city spent
over $5000 investigating, and one affidavit of an employee of defendants'
lawyer.  The trial court denied the motion because the evidence fell "far
short of proving actual prejudice."  49 Cal. App. 4th at 1791.  Moreover,
the trial was to be a court trial, not a jury trial, and defendants showed
no prejudice by the court.  Id.

 Ross v. Kalin, 53 Cal. App. 616 (1921), although an extreme case,
exemplifies that a change of venue motion most likely requires a high
standard of proof.  In Ross, plaintiff's motion for change of venue was
denied.  Plaintiff filed numerous affidavits, in which uncontroverted facts
showed that, as a result of plaintiff's "crusade against vice conditions' in
the City of venue, plaintiff was assaulted by a mob, beaten, tarred and
feathered, and chained to a tree.  Id. at 617.  The local newspaper
published editorials approving the mob action.  Id.  Plaintiff's attorney
was also assaulted and beaten, and banned from two organizations.  Id.  Of
the 8000 to 12000 potential jurors, between 30 and 300 were prejudiced
against the plaintiff at some point in time.  Id. at 619.  The appellate
court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in
finding that this prejudice against the plaintiffs did not outweigh the
defendants' right to have their case tried in the county where they reside
and their witnesses reside.  Id.

Summary of Business & Professions Code 17200 Cases
I sent a two volume set to each of you with a summary of the California
17200 cases.  (Dave and Mike, I know this may be superfluous for you but I
thought you should see what I sent to everybody.)  While the cases do not
break out cleanly, I tried to divide the cases  into those that defined
unfair, preemption, the filed rate doctrine, conspiracy and damages.

Sampling of Tapes
I spoke with Steve Hall today (Stoel Rives).  He has listened to
approximately 2 hours of tapes.  He said they are best described as using
colorful language.  There is some chit chat about what the participants
guess the price might be or what they heard the price might be and some
discussion about a line that may have gone down.

Projects Underway

Data Resolution - No progress today
Fact Memo - I received Steve Hall's memorandum and will incorporate with the
materials I have for distribution tomorrow.
Contracts - We hope to have that package sent out tomorrow.
PUC- No contact from Harvey Morris (PUC in house counsel.)

Thanks
Gary

Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and 
therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the "California" 
markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of 
costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential 
refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are 
being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.

I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:

In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had 
ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had 
not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its 
customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required 
would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has 
merely conditioned its rates "subject to refund."  Accordingly, it is 
inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.
San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, 
although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of 
insolvency.  It has simply said that "there is no assurance that the actual 
wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially 
may be ordered."
San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This 
allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability 
calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  
This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the 
Commission March 9 order. 
The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given 
that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in 
the market for years - "pending a final nonappealable order in these 
proceedings."  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 
order finding that it would not order cost based rates.
This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to 
FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of 
wholesale power "in the California markets" not just for sales in the ISO and 
PX markets.

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO has received a number of calls from Market Participants asking to
review the confidential attachments to the CA ISO/EOB's March 1 motion
requested recently from FERC pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act
(request attached).  Market Participants argue that they require access to
the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion
requested confidential treatment for the attachments "although the ISO and
the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO
Tariff" because they were nonetheless "concerned that release of the
information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect
the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the
generators".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the
confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each
table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.  This
information should assist Market Participants interested in the matter to
prepare any response they may wish to submit to FERC.  Again, Market
Participants should not rely on the CA ISO to make their arguments for them.

Richard,

Tim Belden asked me to relay these concerns about the July 25, 2001 FERC Order to you.  

The biggest concern is that FERC is proposing to order refunds for sales in the Pacific Northwest.  Our refund exposure in the Pacific Northwest may be as much as six times as great as the California refund exposure, because of the greater number and volume of transactions.   

Here is a quick overview of FERC's Order as it affects Enron:

California

Yesterday, the Commission ordered refunds for October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001 in the California spot markets for all hours.  The following transactions will be subject to recalculation of market-clearing prices and subject to potential refund:

1.	Sales into ISO and PX spot markets (real time and day-ahead)
2.	Out of Market ("OOM") sales to the ISO

The Commission ruled that the following transactions are not subject to refunds:

1.	California transactions outside the ISO and PX markets
2.	Bilateral sales to DWR
3.	Sales made pursuant to Dept. of Energy orders

The Commission has given the ISO fifteen days to calculate the proxy price for each hour during the nine-month period.

A significant aspect of this ruling for us is that marketers cannot use purchased power costs to offset potential refunds.  Order at 34.  Generators can justify above-cap costs but marketers cannot.  Therefore, no matter how much we paid for our energy, we will have to refund 100% of the difference between our sales price and the ISO's recalculated price.

Pacific Northwest

The Commission has established a separate proceeding to determine if the prices were unjust and unreasonable for spot market bilateral sales in the Pacific Northwest for the period December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.  The Commission has directed parties to submit factual information to the Administrative Law Judge over a fifteen-day period beginning August 2, 2001.  The judge shall complete discussion and make a recommendation within 37 days.  

If the FERC orders refunds in the Pacific Northwest here are some concerns:

1.	There is no centralized auction, so a larger group of transactions will be swept into the refund net.
2.	In California, "spot market" is defined as a 24-hour period.  The Order says that "spot markets" may be defined differently for the Pacific Northwest.  In Commissioner Massey's dissent and concurrence, he states that spot sales in the Pacific Northwest "could include sales up to a month's duration or even longer."  Massey Dissent, at 4.  If Pacific Northwest spot markets are defined to include term markets, this could significantly increase the amount of money at stake.  A comparison of 2001 YTD transactions for Long Term Pacific Northwest and Short Term Pacific Northwest transactions compared to Short Term California transactions shows a ratio of approximately 6 to 1.
3.	Marketers cannot pass through purchased power costs in the same way that generators can use actual costs to justify prices.  The result is that we may have bought at $500, sold at $550, but if the proxy price is determined to be $200, we will have to pay a refund of $350.
4.	Public power entities are subject to refunds in California, but the FERC's basis for asserting jurisdiction over these "non-jurisdictional" facilities in California---that the entities sold into FERC-authorized markets, e.g., ISO and PX---will not work in the Pacific Northwest.  Result:  Powerex, BPA, and the Pacific Northwest munis, e.g., most of our customers, will be exempt from refunds but we will not be.
5.	The effect of the FERC Order would theoretically be mitigated if Enron were to receive refunds, however:

		a.	we may not get refunds from munis, Powerex, or BPA
			b.	we will not get refunds from generators that can justify above-cap costs.
			c.	Accordingly, we will be paying refunds much more often and in greater amounts than we will receive.

Bottom line:

1.	We need to coordinate our litigation efforts with our Regulatory/Gov't Affairs efforts so that this issue does not fall through the cracks, that we do not lose any appeal rights, and that we present the most effective rebuttal to this attack on our business that we can.
2.	We need to petition FERC to allow marketers to use their costs of purchased power to offset potential refunds.
3.	We need to vigorously oppose refunds in the Pacific Northwest for reasons that are well known to all.  Our fallback position might be that such refunds are arbitrary and capricious unless we can use our purchased power costs and munis are also subject to refunds.  And, in any event, the definition of "spot markets" should not be expanded for the Pacific Northwest.

Steve

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and 
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Tim Belden

Mark, Vicki and Richard:  I assume you are aware of this preliminary CalPx 
Report.


CAL-PX: HIGH PRICES NOT CAUSED BY MARKET MANIPULATION
     A preliminary report by CalPX says California's price spikes this
summer were predictable and were not caused by market manipulation, as
utilities and some lawmakers have suggested, reports Dow Jones
Newswires.
     It blames the high prices on increased demand and low number of
generators. CalPX does say it needs to address some "design flaws" that
"provided incentives to suppliers to speculate on receiving higher
prices in the Real-Time and Ancillary Services markets by moving their
supply to those markets." According to the article, CalPX proposes some
modest changes including making it easier to develop new generation,
spreading the costs of out-of-market purchases to the utilities who
under-scheduled, and encouraging utilities to purchase more electricity
in the forward market (Dow Jones Newswires, Oct. 4).

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators: 

On December 4, 2000, the ISO provided notice regarding the subpoena and
document request it received from the Bureau of State Audits ("Bureau") for
information that is confidential under ISO Tariff Section 20.3.2.  This
notices requests Market Participants to treat the detailed data request
issued by the State Auditor as confidential.  In addition this notice
updates Market Participants on the ISO's schedule for compliance with the
State Auditor's subpoena and data request.

The December 4 notice included a detailed data request.  The State Auditor
has informed the ISO that it considers the detailed data request to be a
confidential document and has asked the ISO to inform Market Participants
that received the detailed data request that they should treat the document
as confidential.  The ISO hereby informs Market Participants on behalf of
the State Auditor that the detailed data request should be treated as a
confidential document.

The December 4 notice indicated that the ISO will seek protection for
information subject to Section 20.3.4 under the Confidentiality Agreement
executed by the ISO and the Bureau. The notice requested that any concerns
relating to the Bureau's subpoena and/or document request be communicated to
the ISO by 9:00 a.m., December 8th. In response to the notice, several
market participants have objected to disclosure of confidential information
to the Bureau. 

Section 20.3.4 of the ISO Tariff provides, in pertinent part, that: "The
Market Participant may, at its sole discretion and own cost, direct any
challenge to or defense against the disclosure requirement and the ISO shall
cooperate with such affected Market Participant to the maximum extent
practicable to minimize disclosure of the information consistent with
applicable law." In accordance with that provision, objecting Market
Participants have the responsibility to pursue more restrictive
confidentiality protections to the extent they are disatisfied with the
protections in place.  Accordingly, the ISO through this notice places
Market Participant's on notice that it will release confidential information
requested by the State Auditor by the end of this week, if it does not
receive an order to the contrary from a Court or the Federal Energy

As you know, I plan to speak at a conference in Santa Fe on Monday.  I have 
adjusted the program so that I am no longer a "witness" who will be 
cross-examined.  That is, Michael Shames will not have an opportunity to ask 
me a series of uninterrupted questions.  I have also crafted a presentation 
that lays out a bunch of facts and introduces a theory for pricing storable 
commodities.  I think that my analysis highlights the major shortcomings for 
the Kahn/Joskow paper and the approach employed by the Department of Market 
Analysis.  My presentation has nothing to do with Enron.  I can defer any 
questions about generators to Gary Ackerman.  I can politely dismiss 
questions about Enron, its trading activities, or profitability.  I still 
could use some help on the just and reasonable price questions.  Attached 
below are the draft power point slides that I will use in the presentation as 
well as a word document with a draft script of the speech.  Please review and 
let me know your thoughts.  I will have my assistant, Debra Davidson, set up 
a call in the next couple of days to discuss.

Today, Friday, Gary Fergus of the Brobeck firm and I met with Attny. Harvey
Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the
five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We
negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an
opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of
the request for production of documents.   This will include a further
extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a
reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We
are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in
Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections.

However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and
senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications,
Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with
the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the
overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme
pressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what was
happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "many
parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the
Governor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing
responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of
cooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" which
would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such
parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.

This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC.
I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never
invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so
by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded
that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply
trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery
requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment
speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve
a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron
officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this
incident.

Attached find Ron's outline of comments on the FERC's November 1 order in the 
Section 206 proceeding.  They are primarily legal arguments.   

Concerning his comments about the congestion management redesign - I'm not 
sure that we want to oppose LMP.  I think instead we want to ensure that 
there are not a large number of nodes.

Alan will be writing the technical comments on the $150 caps, not Seabron.  
Sue called me this morning and said IEP will not be contesting the $150 price 
cap.  This is too bad because we had hoped they would carry the ball on 
arguing why $150 is not sufficient to incent peaking generation.  Sue is 
working on IEP to try to get them to reconsider.

I think we also need to make sure we make all of the arguments that relate to 
the CPUC's subpoena.  I have asked Lysa Akin to set up a conference call 
about this ASAP with Richard, Dan, Gary Fergus, Me, Mike Day, Sue, and Jim.  
Please tell Lysa if I haven't listed you and you wish to be on this call.

Gary,

Attached you will find a November RT (Real Time)  Market Default Invoice 
which was receive by EPMI from the PX this morning.

This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site.  Again, the PX 
failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there.  
Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of 
it's availability.  If Market Participants don't know about this invoice 
being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments.  (That may be 
what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Good luck today! - MO

While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the 
matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, 
Subpart D) pertain only to "proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such 
proceedings as the Commission may order."  18 CFR 385.401.  In this case, 
FERC stated that "a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . ." and 
specifically rejected the use of a "trial-type evidentiary hearing."  Slip 
op. at 47-48 & n.97.  Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my 
preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery 
processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order 
and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case.  
(The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it 
specifically attempts to equate "paper" hearings with "trial-type" hearings; 
see page 1 of its Motion.)

The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery 
in this case under Rule 401.  While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly 
to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or 
someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties.  As a result, we 
need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to 
present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing 
with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that 
Staff has already conducted.

>>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>>
Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not 
included in the list of subject companies:  Exh. B?  Since EPMI is not a 
subject of the motion, why should it answer?  Lying in the weeds may be a 
more prudent course of action.

>>> "Fergus, Gary S." <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>>
I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information.  Here are
the facts we have so far.  On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with
FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel
the production of documents and to shorten time to answer.  According to
Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC
moved against the following entities:  AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant
and Southern.  Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B.  This is not to
say that we could not be easily added to the group.  While the motion reads
as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they
state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.  We will
have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this.  To
repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Thanks
Gary

Subject: Important - CPUC Motion - Confidential Attorney Client
Privilege and Work Product


As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a
protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened
from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this
on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.

They request that we be required:
   to answer their motion on Thursday,
   to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering
   production, and
   to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals,
   specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and
   price.

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its
proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would
oppose their requests for:
   the information to be provided for "government eyes only" -  this would
   prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants.
   a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to "share" this
   information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding)
   pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission
   to make information available to state commissions as may be of
   assistance in state regulation of public utilities.  We should argue
   that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public
   utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale
   marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are
   the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this
   information.)
   the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the
   competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the
   Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's "unfettered access" to the
   forwards market.  This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can
   get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from
   the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

Richard,

In the 10/6/2000 email to Harvey Morris at the CPUC setting forth Enron's
proposed response to the subpoena, Enron stated that it would produce
documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  Does Enron still
intend to produce these documents and information?  If so, what types of
documents and information do we intend to produce and who will be gathering
it?

Thanks,

Peter

Richard:

Do you think you could give me a quick call at your convenience regarding the 
foregoing?  As you know, a number of companies received subpoenas in the 
California PUC investigation last week.  A few of our lawyers received 
inquiries late last week from a couple of those companies, most of which own 
CA situs generation plants, about possibly representing them in that 
investigation.  I informed my partners that we had met on this subject with 
ENA first and I told them to "stall" if at all possible for a few days since 
I wanted LeBoeuf to be available to assist ENA if the opportunity was 
presented to us.  I think you had said you were meeting with Jim and Mark 
last Wednesday to discuss which outside firm you would use and I was not sure 
whether a decision on that front had been reached.  Could you let me know if 
you have decided on another counsel to represent ENA so that I could inform 
my partners that they can go ahead and respond to some of the inquiries they 
have received.  Obviously, we would continue to like to work with ENA on this 
investigation, but we fully understand if you have decided to go with another 
counsel.  As you can appreciate, many of the companies involved are anxious 
to get outside counsel on board quickly, so if you could just let me know 
what the status may be on your front that would be tremendously helpful to 
us.  Thanks very much for your time and consideration in this regard.  I'm 
sorry we were not able to hook up in NYC last week, but hopefully we will be 
able to do that in the near future.  Thanks again.  John

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=

Attached is a brief proposal for economics arguments against the CPUC's 
proposal for load based price caps.  Obviously, these arguments would also 
apply to the ISO Board's recent decision.

Subject: Motion for Interim Relief by CPUC



Mary:

cc: Ron, Jim

I have had a quick read-through of the CPUC Motion, as requested. There
would appear to be two salient points.

1) CPUC asks for FERC to impose strict load-differentiated price caps. These
would be imposed using a formula based on "margina1 heat rates" times an
index gas price. So the maximum cap would be around $100 and the minimum
could be quite low off-peak - more like $30-40/MWh. Needless to say this
does not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets. It was
also completely make redundant any trading into California. The prices would
rise immediately to the low caps, so there would be no incentive for anyone
to enter into any commerical hedging arrangements. The mechanism is
basically similar to the old SRAC QF contracts, but without the capacity
payments.

2) CPUC asks that FERC require all jurisdictional generators AND marketers
to offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity at
FERC regulated rates and conditionns for 18-36 months. They claim these are
like the UK and Australian "vesting contracts", but these involved
significant capacity or options payments as well. CPUC request that all
generators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation of
cost-based filings (how this would actually work is not stated).

Needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out the
market for up to three years, and eliminating any potential profits from
current long positions in the market.

The schemes they have proposed have numerous problems - even if the
objectives were desirable - so there is plenty to poke holes in. The
decision on whether to file any response to me would seem to be based on
whether these issues will be completely addressed in FERC's order, making
the CPUC Motion irrelevant. If there is any chance that the CPUC could be
taken seriously their motion should be opposed, as the restrictions on the
market are quite onerous. Any players with long positions in the market
would stand to lose quite a bit under the proposed capped rates at these
levels.

One note: recall that with respect to market manipulation, one of the most
common accusations focused on the problems caused by the PX manipulation
the utilities engaged in thanks to their monopsony (demand-side bidding)
market power.

Steve Kean will be testifying at the Senate Energy Committee's hearing on
Wednesday regarding California.  Steve and Jim Steffes asked me to contact
you for the following information.  I've listed specific requests for
several people, but am copying many more of you for your input as well.
Anything you can provide by sometime on Monday will be appreciated!

Dave Parquet - Siting of new power plants in California.  Any insight you
can provide regarding the rules, the current climate, what would fix the
current situation, etc.

Richard Sanders - Steve thinks he might be asked about whether the market
was manipulated.  Please provide information on whether this was the case
and who the participants likely were.  What's the current climate regarding
sanctions, etc.?

Mary Schoen - Any information you can provide relating to air emission
issues in California, and specific details for our recommendations
regarding air emissions.

Steve Walton - The status on RTO West, Desert Star, Cal ISO and general
information on RO development.

Sue Mara - Specific ordering language requiring the utilities to buy only
from the PX.  Was it required through legislation or the CPUC, and what
exactly does it mean.  Who was involved in formulating the language?
Information on block forward markets.

Alan Comnes - A copy of the CDWR response and anything they might have
available regarding long term proposals from the government.

Dan Allegretti - We have the e-mail Jim sent regarding the UI deal.  Please
provide more specifics on the deal, and information regarding portfolio
management approach.

Thanks for your help!

On Monday, the Mediator in this case informed the parties that he planned t=
o recommend to the FERC that it adopt a methodology for computing refunds t=
hat largely parallels the methodology that FERC adopted for prospective pri=
ce ceilings in its June 19 order.  That methodology caps prices at a so-cal=
led competitive market price proxy equal to the operting cost of the last g=
enertor dispatched in an hour, which will almost always be a single cycle g=
as plant with a relatively high heat rate.  The Mediator said that he would=
 recommend that this measure be applied from October 2 forward; that it use=
 the actual heat rate and NOx cost of the units dispatched; and that it inc=
lude a 10 percent adder for credit risk.  Apparently, but not entirely clea=
r, the Mediator will also recommend that two retroactive price caps actuall=
y be applied:  one for Northern California, using  the average price of gas=
 at the PG&E citygate and Malin, and another for Southern California, using=
 the SoCal Gas large package price for gas.  The Mediator finally informed =
the parties that he would recommend that FERC convene an evidentiary hearin=
g to be concluded in 60 days for the purpose of taking testimony on, among =
other things, what were the actual operating costs of marginal generators i=
n both the North and South.

The group of power marketers of which Enron is a part was obviously disappo=
inted that the Mediator and his staff felt bound to use this methodology ba=
sed in generator costs, even while acknowledging that it has little relevan=
ce to the cost or value of a marketer's supply portfolio.  The group also e=
xpressed interest in participating jointly and using a joint expert witness=
 in the evidentiary hearing.   I have contacted Seabron Adamson who said he=
 would have not conflict in serving as an expert witness for the group.

If (as appears likely) a hearing is convened in the very near term, it will=
 be imperative to nail down selection of an expert immediatly so that he ca=
n begin preparing discovery to be sent out as soon as a procedural schedule=
 is put in effect.  Thus it would be helpful if you could let me know as so=
on as possible how you wish to proceed.  Do you want to participate in the =
hearing individually or as part  of a group?  Do you want to sponsor an exp=
ert witness? and, if so, do you want to use Seabron or someone else.

As you consider this last question, you should be aware that  PowerEx has i=
nterests largely alligned with the marketer group.   PowerEx is going to sp=
onsor Richard Tabors.  Tabors, in turn, recommended to me that the marketer=

- Attached is the core market pool performance bond.  Debtor's counsel is of 
the opinion that the bond permits a one-time draw and does not replenish.  My 
preliminary review yields the same result.  Our analysis after a more 
thorough review will follow shortly.
- I have asked debtor's counsel for information with regard to how SCE's 
unpaid administrative fees were dealt with by PX (and indeed generally how PX 
calculated/handled chargebacks) and will keep following up until I receive 
the requested information.

Here is the status of projects that I am aware of:
Enquiry into Removal Strategy for Berg Defendants
 I spoke with Rich Levy of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher who represents
SEMPRA in the Berg gas/electric class action filed in Los Angeles.  [(213)
229-7556  rlevy@gdclaw.com]  I asked him whether he would tell me if they
were considering removal of the Berg action.  He told me that he had our
removal papers.  He asked if we had any research that we were willing to
share with him.  He said they looked at preemption, filed rate doctrine,
ripeness etc. and concluded that ultimately we would be in state court.  He
also said that he did not believe there were any good motions to dismiss
that were worth making.  I told him that some of the work product was a
joint defense effort that would require permission to share (e.g. the Paul
Hastings memo) but that there was other work product we might be willing to
share that had been done on behalf of Enron.  I told him that I believed
that there was good ninth circuit authority that was helpful and we really
believed federal court was a better forum for these types of cases.  He told
me he was willing to look at whatever authorities we could give him.   I
also told him that I understood that Mike Weaver represented Sempra in the
San Diego cases and gave him Mike's contact information.  He asked for
copies of our complaints and I sent them on to him.  He is willing to
discuss the case and possibly strategic alternatives.  He told me that El
Paso had retained David Palmer, formerly of Gibson Dunn to represent them in
this action.  El Paso and David Palmer are supposedly meeting on Wednesday
January 3rd.  According to Rich, their time to remove expires on January
16th.

 He told me that the Berg case was originally filed in Texas by the
Denver law firm Astrella & Rice against El Paso.  That case was dismissed
because the plaintiff was not a direct purchaser.  The plaintiffs then
sought to have Southern California Edison agree to be the named plaintiff.
Apparently they refused.  Rich said they were meeting with SCE to find out
what else was said.

 There is a second gas complaint, the Continental Forge case.
Apparently this case was filed in September but never served.  It has now
been amended and has been served.  A copy is attached.  (We obtained this
copy from the plaintiff's website so it does not have a signature for file
stamp, but Rich Levy said it was the complaint that had been served.)
    <<Continental Forge.cmplt.pdf>>
PUC Hearings
 I do not have many of the details of the hearings other than a
report from Mike Day that Michael Aguirre, plaintiffs' counsel in our case,
argued before the PUC that the real culprits are the power marketers and the
solution to the utilities problem is for the utilities to join the
plaintiffs' class action in San Diego.  Apparently today, Aguirre was cross
examining the utility and generator witnesses before the PUC (attempting to
aid counsel for the ratepayers) trying to show that the utilities should sue
the power marketers.
Public Record Act Request
 Michael Aguirre has made a public record act request for all
information subpoenaed by the PUC and "any other documents related to
alleged wrongdoing" from the ISO.  The PUC has set January 3rd as the
response date for comments on the request.
Data Provided by ISO to the PUC
 The ISO has told market participants that they have provided day
ahead and hour ahead schedules to the PUC, Bids, actual metered operations,
RMR, OOM, and OOS calls, generation out of service information and import
and export schedules.
EPMI Data
 Jeff Richter reported today that he believes they now understand
some of the data problems with the EPMI data.  I am scheduled to be in
Portland with Jeff on Friday to resolve the data issues, and discuss
integration of ongoing data collection with pending and potential discovery
requests.
Cornerstone Teleconference
 Dave Noonan reports that Michael Keeley at Cornerstone is very
interested in being retained.  One of his partners has been contacted by
another defendant but has not yet been retained by them yet.  Dave suggested
that we try and do a telephone interview of Michael tomorrow and retain him
if we like what we hear.  His CV is set forth below.  I will try to
coordinate a time tomorrow morning.
AG Investigation
 So far the California AG has been reducing the scope of its data
retention request.  For EES, they basically wanted a snapshot and nothing
else for the time being.  As for individual computers, they want an
organizational chart to select 6-12 computers that they are interested in.
EPMI Tapes Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation
 We are awaiting specific model information about the Nicelog taping
system used in Portland.  Dan Dietrich in IT in Houston is getting that
information for us.  We believe we will have access to some technology that
will assist in the review of these materials.  We will also distribute
shortly the results of our research on the production of such materials and
any exact transcripts prepared of those litigation materials.
Current Trading Practices
 Christian Yoder, Steve Hall, Marcus Woods, Alan Comnes, Dan Watkiss,
Richard Sanders and myself discussed current trading practices in the out of
market and over $150 cap scenarios.  In short, if the ISO calls for power 20
minutes before the hour it is needed, there is no cap.  In some instances,
EPMI will have purchased power for $x and offer to sell it to the ISO at
$x+.  The plus factor being the credit risk and/or the refund risk for
having sold that power in addition to prevailing market conditions.  In the
over $150 cap situation, EPMI will be collecting its cost data to compare
with the prices charged the ISO or PX.  EPMI will be matching its ISO and PX
sales data with comparable high cost energy in its portfolio.  This is
consistent with FERC pre-existing practice.  We also discussed standard
instructions to traders.
Price Gouging Statute
 Richard Sanders has asked that we revisit the California Price
Gouging Statute in view of the current trading practices.   California Penal
Code section 396 prohibits price increases upon the proclamation of a state
of emergency by the President, Governor, or executive officer of any county
or city resulting from a natural or manmade disaster.  For thirty days after
such a proclamation, it is unlawful for any business "to sell or offer to
sell any consumer . . . goods, goods or services used for emergency cleanup,
. . . for a price of more than 10 percent above the price charged by that
person for those goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation of
emergency."  Such a violation is a misdemeanor punishable by one year of
jail time and a fine of up to $10,000.  A violation also constitutes an
unlawful business practice under section 17200.  It is unclear whether this
statute includes the sale of electricity and/ or the declaration of a state
of emergency by the ISO.
Ed Kee Engagement Letter
 Mike Kirby forwarded the form of engagement letter from Ed Kee.
Charles River Engagement Letter
 I have been in discussions with Charles River over the form of the
engagement letter.  I hope to have that resolved shortly.

Thanks

Richard,
 Here is my quick reaction to the idea of Enron terminating its PX
participation agreement in the Core Market:

 1. PX tariff 18.3 says that a participation agreement "may be
terminated by either party upon written notice."

 2. PX tariff 5.3 says with respect to the Core Market
Proportional Charge-Back Methodology:

  "The PX Participant's outstanding default amount will be
charged back to all current PX Participants based upon the percentage of its
gross sales in MWHs to the Total gross MWHs sales in the Core Market during
the three calendar months preceding the event plus the current month to
date."

  3. PX Participant is a defined term:

  "An entity that is authorized to buy or sell Energy or
Ancillary Services through the PX, and any agent authorized to act on behalf
of such entity."

  4. Energy is also a defined term:

  "The electrical energy produced, flowing or supplied by
generation, transmission or distribution facilities, being the integral with
respect to time of the instantaneous power, measured in units of watt-hours
or standard multiples thereof, e.g. 1000 Wh.

  5. Ancillary services is also a defined term:

  "Regulation, Spinning Reserve, Non-Spinning Reserve,
Replacement Reserve, Voltage Support and Black start together with such
other interconnected operation services as the ISO may develop in
cooperation with Market Participants to support the transmission of Energy
from Generation resources to Loads while maintaining reliable operation of
the ISO controlled grid in accordance with good utility practice."

  Bottom line:

  If a PX Participant, as defined in the PX tariff as opposed
to the PX rate schedule for the CTS market, is an entity that is authorized
to buy or sell "instantaneous power" rather than power in the future, then
Enron by withdrawing from its PX participation agreement would no longer be
a current PX participant.  Thus, there is an argument that by withdrawing in
writing prior to any chargeback in the core market, that Enron may be able
to argue it cannot be charged back.

  I also looked at the ADR and dispute resolution procedures
to see if Enron had to be PX Participant to initiate the procedure and
maintain it.  Schedule 9 section 1.1 states that PX ADR procedures shall
apply to all disputes between parties which arise under PX Documents.
Section 2.1 states that the "PX and PX Participants shall negotiate in good
faith..." It goes on to state in Section 2.2 that "any one of the parties"
may submit a statement of claim.  Thereafter, in Schedule 9 it appears that
the references are to parties not PX Participants.  My quick reading is that
you still have to use and get the benefits of the ADR even if you are no
longer a PX Participant.

  Operational Downside:

  Does Enron have to be a PX Participant to get the PX to
schedule the power that Enron has sold in the CTS market as it becomes due?
In other words, if Enron is not a PX Participant, does that mean the PX will
not schedule the power leading to an Enron default under its obligations to
the PX to deliver power?  Could that lead to the underscheduling penalty if
PX  balances its schedule without Enron's power?  I do not know the answer
to this but I am reviewing the tariff.

  Hope this helps
  Thanks
  Gary

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two lawsuits seeking class action status were filed
in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday alleging three major energy companies
conspired to monoploize the natural gas market in southern California and
artificially increase prices and create shortages.
The complaints name Sempra Energy (SRE) and its affiliates San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. and Southern California Gas, along with El Paso Natural Gas
Corp. as defendants.
The complaint claims the companies were involved in "massive conspiracy" and
together agreed to artificially constrict the supply of the commodity by
killing natural gas pipeline projects. The complaint alleges unfair
competition and unlawful business practices.
According to the complaint, top executives of SoCal Gas, SDG&E and El Paso
Natural Gas Corp. met at a Phoenix hotel in 1996 and "fearing a new era of
open competition and lower (natural gas) prices" the executives "gathered
secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the
natural gas and electricity markets."
"At the meeting these three companies illegally agreed not to compete
against each other in Southern California and Baja California natural gas
delivery markets," the complaint states. "They also conspired to prevent
other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and
lowere natural gas prices in these markets."
The defendants have not yet seen a copy of the complaint and were unable to
comment.
(MORE) Dow Jones Newswires 18-12-00
1832GMT Plaintiffs Seek Billions In Damages
The lawsuit claims that El Paso Natural Gas and Sempra and its afilliates
conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have
competed against them resulting in lower natural gas prices.
The plaintiffs are seeking billions of dollars in damages.
The complaint alleges that in 1992 Tenneco Inc. completed the Kern River
Pipeline, which transports natural gas from Wyoming to Kern County, Calif.
Tenneco then began to plan for additional pipelines that would bypass SoCal
Gas and SDG&E pipelines and deliver gas directly to consumers in San Diego,
Los Angeles, Imperial Valley and the Baja Peninisula.
One of those bypass pipelines - the Altamont pipeline -would have
transportecd gas from Canada to the northern end of the kern River pipeline
in Wyoming. Tenneco envisioned that low cost Canadian gas would be carried
to Southern California and Baja customers, according to the complaint.
El Paso acquired Tenneco in June 1996, shortly before California opened up
its electricity market to competition.
According to the complaint, three months later SoCal Gas, SDG&E and El Paso
met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near the Phoenix airport and began to hatch
a conspiracy that the energy companies would eliminate Tenneco's pipeline
projects and continue to dominate the natural gas market via SoCal Gas being
the sole bidder on the Baja pipeline.
SoCal Gas then allegedly agreed to refrain from competing with El Paso on a
pipeline project in Mexico.
"The transportation constraints which the conspirators created eliminate
competition from Canadian gas, radically drove up the price of gas ... (and)
electricity ...and discouraged the building of new electric generation
plants to serve the California market," the complaint states.
Natural gas in California has spiked to a record $60 per million British
thermal unit last week and still hovers at around $20/mbtu, compared with $3
a year ago.
Sempra Energy spokesman Art Larson said his company has not yet been served
with a copy of the complaint, but "any claims that (Sempra) violated
antitrust or other laws are completely false."
"On Dec. 7, SDG&E filed for emergency relief asking federal regulators to
impose a price cap on natural gas transportation prices to the California
border that if approved would lower costs for California gas customers,"
Larson said.
Last Friday, California Gov. Gray Davis asked state Attorney General Bill
Lockyer to investigate whether natural gas suppliers have manipulated the
market in an effort to drive up prices.

20:33 GMT 18 December 2000 DJ Lawmakers Ask Justice Dept To Probe Calif
Pwr,Natural Gas
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Two California lawmakers have asked the U.S.
Department of Justice to investigate "potential collusion" in the state's
highly volatile electricity and natural gas markets.
The lawmakers - U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and John Burton,
president pro tempore of the California State Senate - asked Attorney
General Janet Reno to take "immediate steps" to investigate California
markets for electricity and natural gas.
"We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the
electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers," the letter said.
The lawmakers questioned whether repairs or maintenance were truly behind
why a quarter of the state's generating plants weren't operating in recent
weeks, contributing to the latest power-supply emergency in California.
"Some have suggested that one reason for (power) plant shutdowns is that in
some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to
operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market," the
lawmakers said.
"The Department of Justice must act to ensure that collusion and other
unlawful acts are not contributing to the crisis in California's power
markets," they told Reno.
The probe must begin now, despite the pending change in presidential
administrations next month, to set "a strong example of leadership for the
new attorney general to follow," Boxer and Burton wrote.
There was no immediate response from the Justice Department to the letter,
which was dated Friday.
"I'd be very surprised if the Justice Department found any gaming or
violation of the law," said Lynne Church, president of the Electric Power
Supply Association, whose members operate deregulated power generation
facilities in California.
Any DOJ investigation would be on top of probes already under way by the
U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the state of California and
others, she said. "I'm not too nervous about that one," Church said of the
prospect of DOJ joining the fray.
Neither the California Independent System Operator nor officials in the
Pacific Northwest found any evidence of price-gouging in separate
investigations they conducted, Church noted.
Power prices skyrocketed in California because of the flawed market
structure state officials imposed, she said.
"There's no doubt those markets went higher than they would have if that
structure were not in place," she said. "But the fact that (power producers)
made a lot of money doesn't mean they violated the law."

Subject: CAISO Notice: Subpoena from the Attorney General


To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The ISO received a subpoena today from the California Attorney General.  The
subpoena requires a response March 23. The subpoena and the cover letter are
attached.  The cover letter indicates that the Attorney General agrees to
abide by the confidentiality provisions outlined in an October 25, 2000
letter from the Attorney General which is also attached.  The CA ISO will
mark as confidential documents it produces to the Attorney General that
contain information subject to 20.3.2, and will request confidential
treatment in accordance with the AG's October 25 letter. Concerns related to
the subpoena should be relayed directly to the Attorney General. The AG
contact related to the subpoena is Richard Rochman who can be reached at
(415) 703-1404.   The ISO would appreciate being notified also of any
concerns.  The ISO contacts are Jeanne Sol, at jsole@caiso.com
<mailto:jsole@caiso.com>  and Norma Formanek at  <mailto:nformanek@fbm.com>

Next Steps

Resumes 1/10/01 in WDC.  Enron will continue to attend.

In the Room

Reliant submitted its proposal for blended rates and determining the real gap 
between a blended wholesale price and potential retail rates. Reliant showed 
that the gap is potentially quite small.
Reliant's effort was to move us away from the "Sharing the Pain" concept 
offered by PG&E.
Enron again requested utility ideas for a quid pro quo, assuming any deal 
could be struck.
Judge requested additional info from ISO and PX on market shares -- several 
marketers explained their concern (e.g. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, 
Avista) that this request gave credence to the "Pain" allocation proposal and 
refused to give permission to release their data.  Enron said it was checking 
on whether to release the data, but had the same concerns as the other 
marketers on the principles.
Judge decided to use a joint statement for his report (see attached) to the 
public. The statement was agreed to, in large part, by the participants.
Judge mentioned that 40% of the A/S market is apparently held by three 
municipal/alien utilities. 
Judges order urges participation by these parties.


Out of the Room

More bilateral discussions between utilities and gens.
Marketers discuss whether to continue to stay in the room and participate.

Mike,
 We are working on revising the draft email to the CPUC and need some
additional information from you.  First, would it be accurate to say that
Enron Energy Marketing Corporation and Enron Energy Services Operations Inc.
do not have responsive documents to the subpoenas and that any information
would reside at ESS?  In other words, we do not have documents to produce
from those two entities.  If that is not correct, how would we describe what
documents these entities have/what will we produce?
 To the extent that ESS is evaluating whether it will provide
electronic data (less the customer specific information), we also need to
know how that process is going, whether the data will be similar to what
EMPI is working on, and whether an October 27, 2000 production date is
realistic.

Thanks
Gary

ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

Here is where our analysis stands Sunday night:

Claimants Against Enron:

EWEB		$19,982,000  [Note: Only for deliveries after 6/20/01.] [12
month spot market]
California Parties	      200,000  [CDWR Only][2 year refund period]
Tacoma		  $2,500,000  [all periods][24x24 plus index deals]
Seattle City Light  79,494,349  [all periods][18 months spot market]
	[Note:  Seattle City Light uses only five "fair prices" $19.86,
23.18, 27.16, 66.47, 81.62]
Modesto Irrigation District  $299,615.50


Evaluating these claimants using Enron DATA and CAISO 8/9/01 heat rates:
				Physical Only	 All   [Note: this is for
12/25-6/20]
EWEB	24x24  	  -199,344		-575,150
		24-7 day	    -34,946		  -54,303
		7-31 days	$3,851,579	      -1,890,748
		31-366 days   679,468		  679,468

Tacoma	24x24	-1,131,790	      -9,189,085
		24-7 days      -49,096	      -4,317,095
		7-31 days	   126,844		  126,844
		31-366days 3,729,662	      14,715,188

Seattle	24x24	1,172,831	          875,204
		24- 7days     689,353		  320,750
		7-31 days 23,249,605	      25,081,446
		31-366days   961,513		1,006,280

Modesto   	24x24	   190,051		  190,051
		24-7 days	       -			-
		7-31 days  -8,084,920	      -8,240,938
		31-366days-1,154,850	      -3,029,559

Observations:  24x24 is still our best picture for just these claimants.
		     Netting is still critical
		     Excluding bookouts lowers over all netting risk (lower
sales overall)
			but hurts with Tacoma numbers.  (We book out a lot
of
			Tacoma purchases over the California reference
price.)
		     We will owe Seattle more if exclude bookouts. (We book
out
                        more Seattle sales than purchases.)

This is still fairly rough.  I would not quote or distribute these numbers.
Thanks

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

I am OK with most of these, and will incorporate them ASAP.


On the deleted paras (26-30). My intention was to respond to the assertion
by Sheffrin that large nmbers of bids near the MCP  was indicative of market
power, combined with large number of bids at much higher prices at higher MW
levels (e.g. bid $150/MWh at 200 MW but $300/MWh at 250 MW). The first point
I could easily summarize more succintly, the second I think takes more
effort.

Of course, the fact that large numbers of bids around the MCP were submitted
by importers merely suggests in reality that people are pretty smart, and
new that prices in neighboring markets (e.g. in the NW) would settle at
similar levels. For those of you with an legal anti-trust background, it
merely confirms why the entire analysis is shaky - the fundamental market
definition is wrong (market definition being one of the key elements of
anti-trust economics and law). As even the MSC has agreed, the California
market is not a market on its own, but instead is well-integrated with the
rest of the West. So it is very difficult to look at half a market and come
up with sensible conclusions...

I can try to cut this down, or we can eliminate it altogether. I think it
does help address one of the accusations raised by Sheffrin, but I leave it
to you legal eagles to let me know whether responding to the issue is worth
the tradeoff in terms of the length of the affidavit. Suggestions welcome...

I am forwarding to you two files:

The first is a draft of EPMI's answer.  I hope I have made your job easier
by providing you with a first draft..  I expect that you'll do your usual
magic turning it into a legal pleading.

The second is Seabron's affidavit, including my comments. .  Seabron needs
to live by the suggested edits, of course, so he get's veto rights over the
weekend.

Gary, Richard S.:

Please review w.r.t. litigation compatiblity.

Seabron,

Please start with my version and let me know any major issues you have with
my suggested edits.

Tim, Sue, Ray:  Please review.  Tim, make sure you look at paragraphs
26-30.

Subject: Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing)

After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Hall's summary.  There's some=20
redundancy but hopefully, this provides a few more details.    Also, Mary H=
.=20
and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to=
=20
approve the ISO=01,s request in full.

Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing):

The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO.

1) ISO=01,s $250/MWh Soft Cap
a) Summarized: ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so=
ft=20
cap but raises the soft cap level to $250 from the $150/MWh proposed by the=
=20
FERC: =01&The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi=
th an=20
interim =01&soft=018 price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th=
e=20
Commission=01,s November 1 Order. The ISO=01,s scheduling system will not r=
eject=20
Energy bids priced in excess of the $250/MWh price cap, but will evaluate=
=20
those bids in price merit order. However, if the ISO issues Dispatch=20
instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in=20
excess of the $250 soft cap, those bids will not set the Market Clearing=20
Price for Imbalance Energy. Rather, those Scheduling Coordinators will be=
=20
paid in accordance with their bids.=018

b) Refund risk and cost documentation above $250. =01&Imbalance Energy abov=
e the=20
level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund, based on subsequent=
=20
review by the Commission. It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th=
at=20
submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission, a=
s=20
well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha=
t=20
they may bring questionable bids to the Commission=01,s attention.

i) Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental=
=20
to what was requested by the FERC. See p. 8

ii) Regarding production costs:  fuel, taxes, emission credits, startup cos=
ts=20
are all listed as costs.  However, no mention of noncontiguous scheduling=
=20
costs or reasonable profit.

iii) Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs:  In a footnote to cover letter=
,=20
ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess =
of=20
10% of the production costs or $25/MWh, whichever is lesser.

c) Useful quote: =01&In light of current fuel prices and the ISO=01,s recen=
t=20
experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at=
=20
prices of $150 or less in many hours, the ISO believes that a $150 soft cap=
=20
would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an as-bid basis.=
=018

d) Effective date: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00.=20

e) Term of this soft cap:  lesser of 3 mo (3/8/01) or whenever the Commissi=
on=20
supercedes it by its own order.

f) Applicable tariff sections.  Section 2.5.23.2 and .3.  See attachments=
=20
A1/B1 to the filing.


2) Participating Generator Penalties
a) Summary: =01&the ISO proposes in Amendment No. 33 to assess penalties ag=
ainst=20
Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO=20
Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to=
=20
avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency. They would be charged an=
=20
amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea=
ch=20
hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond. In addition, i=
f,=20
during that hour, the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other=
=20
than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as=20
interruptible, the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty =
of=20
$1000/MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver.=018
b) Allowed excuse:  The penalties would not apply if the Participating=20
Generator has notified the ISO (within the hour of instruction), and=20
subsequently demonstrates (documentation within 72 hours) , that its=20
Generating Unit, System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to=20
operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not =
be=20
waived.

c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of 5.6.1 .2 and .3. See=20
attachments A2/B2 to the filing.

d) Effective date: Same as the ISO=01,s new soft cap: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00

e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision.

3) Load Imbalance Penalties

a) Summary: =01&Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that  market to serve t=
heir=20
Loads the ISO=01,s costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the propose=
d=20
soft price cap or through out-of-market Dispatches when bids are=20
insufficient. Specifically, those costs would be allocated to Scheduling=20
Coordinators in proportion to their Demand that appears unscheduled in=20
real-time (underscheduled Load) and Generation that is scheduled but does n=
ot=20
appear in real-time, except to the extent that the underscheduled Load or=
=20
undelivered Generation is balanced within the Scheduling Coordinator=01,s=
=20
portfolio.=018  The costs of dispatching units that have bid above the Mark=
et=20
Clearing Price for Energy to Scheduling Coordinators in proportion to their=
=20
Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations (in essence, the amount by which their=
=20
metered Demand exceed their metered Generation). Cover letter, p. 10.=20

b) Net Negative Uninstructed Deviation (NNUD) defined: =01&The real time ch=
ange=20
in Generation or Demand associated with underscheduled Load (i.e., Load tha=
t=20
appears unscheduled in real time) and overscheduled Generation (i.e.,=20
Generation that is scheduled in forward markets and does not appear in real=
=20
time). Deviations are netted for each BEEP Interval, apply to a Scheduling=
=20
Coordinator=01,s entire portfolio, and include Load, Generation, Imports an=
d=20
Exports=018


c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of  11.2.4.2.1.  See=20
attachments A3/A3/B3 to the filing.

d) Effective date:  For loads scheduled for  12/12/00.  (Essentially, loads=
=20
scheduled on 11/11 for next day).

e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision.


4) Useful Info from the Detmers Declaration

a) =01&During the recent 7-day period from December 1, 2000 through Decembe=
r 7,=20
2000, planned Generating Unit outages have averaged roughly 4,000 MW. Durin=
g=20
this same 7-day period, forced or unplanned outages of generating have be=
=20
very high, averaging approximately 7,000 MW. =01&
b) =01&For example, for the last four days (December 4, 2000 to December 7,=
=20
2000) we have purchased 255,000 MWh of OOM Energy. The cost of these=20
purchases were approximately $167 million. MWh.=018  (Equivalent to an aver=
age=20
OOM cost of $655/MWh.)

Richard and Gary:

I can shed some light on this.  Harvey called me on my way back into town
yesterday to ask if we were contesting service on EEMC, as you will recall
we asked him to confirm whether EEMC had actually been served.  I replied as
Gary and I had discussed that we were not going to question the
effectiveness of service on EEMC as counsel had both notice and copies of
the subpoena.  Harvey then went on to indicate that he would be sending an
email to "confirm" the phone conversation which Gary and I had with him,
particularly emphasizing that he had verbally reserved the right to seek
additional information, especially confidential profit information, after
reviewing our transactional information.  I agree with Gary that we only
raised going back to June 99 data as a possibility we were going to discuss
with the client, but Harvey did continue to reserve the right to seek data
back even farther than that if they were not satisfied with our response.
This email is his confirmation.  If we wisht o offer a clarification, we
could have Gary send a short e-mail saying our inquiry into the June 99 data
is continuing and we had not formally committed providing that data subject
to further discussions with the client.

Richard,
    I am not sure what prompted this email today but here it is.  You will
note that Harvey did reinterpret the 1999 request slightly from whether we
would go back that far to how long it would take.  I wonder if the newspaper
articles had anything to do with it.....

Thanks

Gentlemen:
This will confirm our tentative agreement to your e-mail subject to our
right to follow-up (under the subpoenas already issued) to the extent that
the Enron Entities' responses on Oct. 13, 2000 and Oct. 27, 2000 are not
sufficient. For example, per your request, we will review the electronic
data base you provide us on the various transactions before we decide
whether we will insist on the confidential financial records addressing any
of the Enron Entities' profits or losses in the purchase and sale of
electricity in the WSCC. You also stated that we would receive the
electronic data base for 2000 on Oct.27, 2000 and that you will check with
your clients as to how soon you can get us the data for the transactions
from June through December, 1999.

 This will further confirm that your response to the subpoenas on behalf of
the Enron Entities, includes Enron Energy Marketing Corporation (EEMC), as
your Oct. 13, 2000 cover letter states. Therefore, as Mike Day orally agreed
in today's telephone conversation, there is no need for the Commission to
reissue or serve a new subpoena on EEMC.

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

                Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

        Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of

the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

        Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy

Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

        Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the

burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars

of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
"family trees" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for

earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first

wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

        The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will

identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

        The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
"Transaction Documents") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which

information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings

regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

        For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell

generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,

do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to

produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

         For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one

half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  Nevertheless, Portland
General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction Documents
in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities,
to the extent relevant as discussed below.  We propose that the Commission
defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the
information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy
into the California market.  At that time a more accurate assessment can be
made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited
impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market.


TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

        We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for

the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.

EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the

Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

        The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


        Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

        We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

        We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know

if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Mike, Richard, and Gary:

What I was suggesting was that we would produce the limited items that we
are proposing under the terms of the existing protective order (which are
inadequate, but we are not giving up any of the crown jewels at this point)
while conditioning our production on two points, first, that we reserve the
right to seek stronger protection in the order (a la Williams' motion) for
any subsequent materials we do agree to produce or which are compelled to be
produced, and two, that the materials we are currently producing which are
entitled to confidentiality (the trading data at a minimum) shall be subject
to the most stringent protective order which the Commission issues in this
proceeding, i.e., we get the benefit of any additional protections Williams
can secure.  I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by not
being one of the "bad guy" generators who are actively taking on the
protective order, when we know that at least four generators are producing
nothing until their motion is resolved, and one marketer (Coral/Shell
Energy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to most
of the document request.  I have also recently learned that Calpine has
gotten an extension until Oct. 13 and will try to delay and hold off
producing much data.  I will get getting a copy of Coral's objections to the
commission shortly.

Does that mean we are satisfied with the PO as it stands now--that we are
willing to live with it with no changes?  Should we consider going for a
stronger PO to be effective when we produce the second wave (recognizing
that we are not all that concerned with the info we produce on the first
wave on the 13th)?  That way we can still appear reasonable in what we
produce, keep the PUC engaged on our terms, and still go for the strongest
PO possible.

Subject:  RE: Cal PUC Subpoenas


Williams, Southern, Reliant and AES have filed motions to make the
protective order significantly stricter, and to stay the production of
documents until the protective order issues are resolved.  These generators
are taking a much harder line.  Counsel for Southern has advised me that
some of the generators may challenge a large part of the data request on
grounds of jurisdictional, burden, and trade secret intrusion.  It seems to
me that it may be best to let the generators fight for a stronger
protective
order, and not take their side at this time.  We might well want to
consider
proposing a "most favored nations clause" in our letter to the CPUC
tomorrow
in order to take advantage of what ever tighter protective order is
eventually agreed to.  Generally, I feel the generators' stance will allow
us to be right where we want to be, not out front leading the charge, not
turning over everything right away, but instead making "just enough" of a
production to avoid being the center of attention.

I will forward the generators' pleadings to you as attachments to this
e-mail.  Gary, I believe, already has them.

Brings up another question--what is our current conventional wisdom about
the protective order and do we plan to seek a stronger one?  Thanks.

We know that some generators, such as Reliant, are planning to turn over to
the CPUC most of the data being requested, after trying to obtain a more
restrictive protective order.  Many other parties are just beginning to
deal
with the process and are only at the stage of asking for two week
extensions.  We are trying to gather additional data about other retail
marketers.  Mike Day

Do we have any information about what our competitors are doing in response
to
these subpoenas?  I recall that the generators had been getting together to
discuss response strategies and I wonder if anything like that is being
done
on
the marketer side.  Thanks.

I am a private citizen with no direct financial interest in the energy
situation in California. However, I possess what is probably an average
sense of decency regarding public behavior and was outraged to read the
public comments of Californian Attorney General, Bill Lockyer, in the Wall
Street Journal regarding your CEO. I am not hopeful that much will come of
my complaint to the State Bar of California regarding Mr. Lockyer's behavior
but feel better for asking the Bar to examine Mr. Lockyer's shameful
behavior.

I'm forwarding a notice from the California ISO, telling us it will be 
responding to a very broad Subpoena from the Electricity Oversight Board 
(EOB).  Many of the questions relate to the period of from September 2000 
through November 2000.  The ISO indicates that it will be answering the 
requests because the EOB has granted what it believes is an adequate 
protective order.  This order agrees to keep the answers to certain questions 
confidential, but to provide them to the CPUC and the AG if they agree to 
keep them confidential.  If we have concerns about the confidential order we 
are supposed to advise the ISO by Monday 12/1, at 9:00 a.m.  The subpoeana, 
and confidential order, and a letter explaining the treatment of the various 
requests are attached.

I am assuming that because the order appears to protect our commercial 
interests, we will not protest this.  Richard - let me know if you want to 
have a conference call on this and I'll have Lysa set one up.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) Further Subpoena


  ISO Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

  The Electricity Oversight Board ("EOB") has issued a further
subpoena to the ISO in the context of its ongoing investigation of
California's electricity grid and markets during and subsequent to the
Summer 2000. The subpoena seeks information that is confidential under ISO
Tariff Section 20.3.2. This notice is provided in accordance with Tariff
Section 20.3.4 and includes the subpoena as an attachment.

  The EOB has issued three letters in which it sets forth the
confidential treatment it will afford confidential information produced by
the ISO including:

* an initial letter dated July 20 which addresses data subject to ISO
Tariff Section 20.3.;
* a letter dated July 28 which addresses additional data; and
* a letter dated October 3 which clarifies that the confidential
treatment set forth in the July 20 and 28 letters will be applied by the EOB
on an ongoing basis in its investigation of the electricity markets.

  The three letters are attached to this notice.

  The ISO will mark as confidential documents it produces to
the EOB that contain information subject to 20.3.2. It is the ISO's
understanding that the confidential treatment provided by the EOB to
information subject to 20.3.2 is satisfactory to Market Participants. The
ISO intends to comply with the EOB subpoena in a timely manner on December
18. If a Market Participant requires any further confidentiality protection,
the ISO expects such Market Participant to take timely action to obtain
directly from the EOB such further protection so that production by the ISO
is not delayed. The ISO would appreciate being notified of any such action
and its resolution so that it can comply with its responsibilities as set
forth in ISO Tariff section 20.3.

  The EOB contact related to the subpoena is Eric Saltmarsh
who can be reached at (916) 322-8601.

  Any concerns relating to the EOB's subpoena should be
communicated by 9:00 a.m. on Monday, December 11th, to Jeanne Sol, at
jsole@caiso.com <mailto:jsole@caiso.comburns@caiso.com> , and copied to
Charlie Robinson at crobinson@caiso.com <mailto:crobinson@caiso.com>  and

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-09-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc., Enron Energy Services Inc., Enron Energy Marketing
Corporation, Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Portland General
Electric Corporation ("Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 We are writing on behalf of the Enron Entities to confirm our
informal discussions regarding the subpoena's served on those entities by
the California Public Utilities Commission ("Commission").  First, we are
sending this via email at your suggestion, rather than traditional hard copy
letter through the United States mail.  We think this is a good suggestion
and we understand that we will be able to reply upon an electronic response
from you via email even though it will not be signed and we will not have a
hard copy sent by you.  If for some reason this is incorrect, please let us
know immediately.

 The subpoenas, as issued, all call for a production of documents by
Wednesday October 4, 2000 unless other arrangements are made.  At our face
to face meeting last Friday, September 29, 2000, Michael Day and I discussed
with you the practical problems associated with the Enron Entities
attempting to respond within that time frame.  Our understanding after that
meeting is as follows:

(1) The Enron Entities will not be required by the Commission to produce
documents or respond to the subpoenas in any way by October 4, 2000.  The
Commission agrees that these entities have not waived any objections or
challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses,
objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been
specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.

(2) The Enron Entities will provide to you via email on October 5, 2000
a summary of the narrowing of the subpoena requests along the lines that we
discussed on Friday, whether some of the ideas for producing information
electronically is feasible, identification of those categories of documents
that can be produced in the first production wave set for October 13, 2000,
a proposed date and categories of documents for a second wave of production,
and identification of problem and/or particularly objectionable
subcategories of documents.

 Please confirm by return email that we have accurately recorded our
informal discussions and we are authorized to proceed as outlined.

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers    Sunday, May 20, 2001 
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 


Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy industry workers. 

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 

The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times as much as a year ago. 

Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 

Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. 

But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed to the plants' deteriorating condition. 

"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units up." 

Unusual phone calls 

Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's headquarters in Houston. 

According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up. 

"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change." 

The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 

"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 

Corporate denial 

Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 

While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 

"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within an hour." 

Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first. 

The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 

Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business practices laws. 

Invisible practice 

How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 

One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators. 

When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required. 

The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, the output was back at the expected level. 

Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 

The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more aggressive than others. 

"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would go up. 

"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 'Bring it down again.' " 

Rapid changes 

These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which also reduced wear and tear. 

"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on the units." 

ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power. 

But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices. 

A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies. 

Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity from all sources. 

Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. (278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 

Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 

Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 

accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures. 

Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 

But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem. 

Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance. 

Ramping may be rampant 

Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in Minneapolis, he said. 

Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 

In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the "major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 

One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met. 

On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 

"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

Richard,
 Here is a brief analysis of what Gov. Davis and other Californian's
had to say at the Nov. 9th hearing.  We got this transcript from Dan Watkis
because nobody who was there from Enron or Bracewell (that we spoke with)
could give us the details of their testimony.

Thanks
Gary

Here is the Milberg opposition to the ex-parte application and the motion to
stay in Hendricks.  It was apparently filed and served by mail on Friday,
although I had to call Simon's office yesterday to get a copy.  Note that
Milberg makes no mention of the 455 issue.

Krause is apparently filing an opposition brief today in Gordon.

We will discuss hearing status, etc on call today.

Governor Davis Blocks Liquidation of Edison Contracts


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT: E. Jesus Arredondo
Friday, February 02, 2001
626.537.3155

Beth Pendexter

626.537.3154


Pasadena, CA- California Governor Gray Davis issued a last minute Executive
Order prohibiting the California Power Exchange from liquidating Southern
California Edison's forward positions.  The liquidation proceeding is an
attempt to recover approximately $250 million Edison is in default on to
CalPX market participants.

Davis' Executive Order nullifies a Los Angeles County Superior Court
decision that earlier today authorized CalPX to liquidate Edison's forward
market positions. The following is excerpt from Governor Davis' Executive
Order:

 It is ordered that the contracts and trades in the market for the
sales and purchases of forward contracts and trades for electricity (known
as the "Block Forward" market) for the delivery of electricity possessed by
Southern California Edison Company*is hereby commandeered by the State of
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State
of California.

CalPX will transfer the Edison contracts to the State of California. State
law requires that the state shall pay "the reasonable value thereof," and
based on competitive market conditions today, CalPX determined the value of
these contracts, for 2,846,000 megawatt hours, at over $651 million.


- 30 -

CalPX is a non-profit public benefit corporation established in 1998 with
the passage of AB1890, which restructured the electric utility industry
within the state of California.

	"Borchardt, Tiffaney" <TBorchardt@caiso.com> 06/01/2001 05:50 PM 	   To: ISO Market Participants <IMCEAEX-_O=CAISO_OU=CORPORATE_CN=DISTRIBUTION+20LISTS_CN=ISO+20MARKET+20PARTICIPANTS@caiso.com>  cc:   Subject: Amendment of the CPUC subpoena for production on June 4 with mont hly updates, and clarification on confidential treatment	



To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

Today the ISO received an amendment to the subpoena from the California
Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC")  issued May 25 (and circulated to
Market Participants on that date) and requiring a response by June 4.  The
subpoena of May 25 and the amendment require monthly updates on an ongoing
basis. The ISO intends to comply with the monthly update requirement.  In
addition, the ISO received a letter from the CPUC clarifying the
confidential treatment it will afford confidential information produced in
response to the subpeona and amendment.  The May 25 subpoena and the
amendment and letter on confidentiality are attached.

In its June 4 production and subsequent monthly updates, the ISO will mark
as confidential documents it produces to the CPUC that contain information
subject to 20.3.2, and will request confidential treatment in accordance
with the CPUC's letter on confidentiality. Concerns related to the subpoena
should be relayed directly to the California Public Utilities Commission.
The CPUC contact related to the subpoena is Robert Cagen who can be reached
at (415) 703-2197.   The ISO would appreciate being notified also of any
concerns.  The ISO contacts are Jeanne Sol? at jsole@caiso.com and Norma
Formanek at  <mailto:nformanek@fbm.com> nformanek@fbm.com both of whom
should be copied on correspondence.

Jim/Vicki:

I have just received the attached correspondence relating to a subpoena 
issued by the California Public Utilities Commission (the "Commission") to 
the Automated Power Exchange ("APX").  The Commission is seeking from APX 
records associated with an investigation of the wholesale energy market in 
California. 

I understand that we have already received a subpoena and that  Mike Smith is 
already handling this matter.

		 Subject: Commission Hearings on Rate Stabilization Plans




You are undoubtedly aware of the critical energy situation in California.? 
Among other things, the FERC has issued an order for the restructuring of the 
wholesale market and the California PUC is continuing hearings on rate relief 
for the investor owned utilities and other issues.? We are monitoring the 
hearings in both Washington and California and advising our friends and 
clients as developments occur.? The following is our most recent report.

Hearings on PG&E's and SCE's rate stabilization plans continued on Friday 
with testimony by Walter Campbell, Director of Business and Financial 
Planning at PG&E, who presented PG&E's prima facie case, and James Asseltine, 
Managing Director at Lehman Brothers, who testified as to PG&E's financial 
condition. President Lynch attended the hearings in the morning (I understand 
that the 3 Republican appointed Commissioners are on vacation and have been 
noticeably absent from the hearings).? Hearings will continue on Tuesday, 
January 2 with testimony from Edison.? Also on Tuesday, an all party meeting 
will be held with Commissioner Wood, presumably for the purpose of 
facilitating settlement negotiations (on Thursday, December 28, Governor 
Davis facilitated a similar meeting between the utilities and consumer groups 
with little progress).? The Commission meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 
January 4, at which time the Commission is expected to issue a final order (a 
copy of the final order may be posted on the Commission's website at 
www.cpuc.ca.gov 15 minutes prior to the meeting).

PG&E is requesting: 

1.? An end to the rate freeze. 
2.? An explicit statement that procurement costs are recoverable in rates 
from retail customers.? Surprisingly, Mr. Campbell indicated that rate 
recovery on a going forward basis from the October or November billing 
periods may be a survivable outcome for PG&E (this was later downplayed on 
redirect examination).

3.? A meaningful rate increase.? Mr. Campbell indicated that PG&E would be 
satisfied with a 26% increase in rates. 
4.? Follow up means of subsequent rate increases.? Mr. Campbell indicated 
that customers could expect rate increases totaling up to 40% over the next 
two years depending on market conditions.

SCE, who will be cross-examined on Tuesday, is asking for a larger rate 
increase--an average of 30% immediately, to be followed by an undetermined 
number of 5% rate hikes over the next two years.

The following facts came out in the cross-examination of PG&E: 

1.? PG&E recovered $9.6 billion in its transition cost recovery account 
during the transition period. 
2.? PG&E transferred $7.75 billion during the transition period to its 
parent. 
3.? PG&E paid dividends of $1,471,000,000 during the transition period. 
4.? PG&E paid a dividend of $116 million in October when it knew as soon as 
June that it was amassing a huge underrecovery of its procurement costs.

5.? For the 4th quarter, PG&E's parent has declared a dividend (a legal 
obligation of the parent).? PG&E has not determined whether to declare a 
dividend.

6.? PG&E's parent has approximately $200 million in cash which it could use 
to pay its declared dividend. 
7.? 75% of the parent company's revenues came from PG&E in 2000. 
8.? PG&E projects a borrowing need of $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 
2001. 
9.? PG&E will not have sufficient cash to purchase gas or electricity within 
3 to 7 weeks. 
10.? PG&E has not attempted to borrow from its parent and its parent has 
little or no borrowing power. 
11.? There is not enough time for its parent to consider selling assets of 
other subsidiaries. 
12.? PG&E is fully borrowed under its commercial paper programs and bank 
lines. 
13.? PG&E has not considered cutting back executive salaries. 
14.? Parent company subsidiaries made $10 million on power trading in Western 
markets. 
15.? On Tuesday, PG&E will report on its generation revenues.? Mr. Campbell 
indicated that approximately 40-50% of the undercollections could be netted 
out by the generation revenues.

13.? By the end of the year, PG&E estimated that its undercollections will 
total more than $7 billion. 

Based on the last several days, I believe that the Commission is very 
reluctant to declare an end to the rate freeze, particularly if this means 
that the Commission will lose rate control over the hydro assets.? 
Alternatively, I believe that President Lynch feels that she has? the 
necessary statutory authority to order interim emergency rate relief, subject 
to refund.? In this regard, in the last day of hearings I believe that PG&E 
met its burden of establishing an emergency condition, which will allow the 
Commission to act on an emergency basis.

Several months ago at an industry conference where Commissioner Wood spoke, 
he indicated that he felt his only responsibility under the law was to 
consumers.? Thus, I would expect Commissioner Wood to be on the low end on 
the percentage of rate increase allowed (he does not seem to concerned about 
the utility entering bankruptcy).? Loretta Lynch takes her cue from Governor 
Davis and Governor Davis has publicly stated that a 20% rate increase may be 
reasonable.? Commissioner Neeper's term ends Sunday and he will not vote on 
the order.? As mentioned above, Commissioners' Duque and Bilas have been 
noticeably absent from these proceedings.? In any event, given the way 
President Lynch controls the Commission, you can expect her view to prevail 
and rate increases to be more in the range of 18-22%.

I also believe that Commissioner Wood and President Lynch are inclined to 
find that the utilities' undercollections to date are a risk they assumed 
under AB1890.? It is possible that the Commission will allow the recovery of 
past undercollections, but would net out the undercollections with its 
generation revenues.

As far as subsequent rate increases on a going forward basis, President Lynch 
has indicated that she is only willing to consider the issues which must be 
decided on an emergency basis.? She will likely reject any attempt by the 
utilities to obtain rate relief on an emergency basis for periods which could 
be the subject of a full rate hearing.

Please feel free to contact me at 213-892-4563 or Ed Feo at 213-892-4417 with 
any questions or requests for documents.? Milbank will plan to cover and 
issue a report on Tuesday's hearing and the all party meeting and on 
Wednesday's Commission meeting.

Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to 
cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts 
until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has 
proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts 
back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend 
its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks 
the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero.

I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of 
the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission 
ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and 
(2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed 
in the auction.  

Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about 
it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its 
retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it?

What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero?

Attached are the volumes for 1999 that I sent to FERC in response to data 
request number 8.  I don't know if I kept a copy of the E-mail with which I 
forwarded these data responses.  

Also, I'm forwarding the response concerning the 2000 volumes.  FERC staff 
gave us additional time to provide this response as it took us a while to 
pull the WSCC information out of our national numbers.  As mentioned in the 
earlier E-mail I forwarded from Brian Harrington, FERC gave us confidential 
treatment of these numbers.

Does this in any way affect our decision to turn over the EES transactional

If not, I will be forwarding the final data this morning.

DJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.



(This article was originally published Thursday)


     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission 
likely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall 
profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and 
customers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.

     A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating 
the wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the 
"expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done."

     "Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court 
to decide if generators should refund money," the commissioner said. "I don't 
think the state is willing to spend the money or the time."

     In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison 
International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit 
Pacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their 
ratepayers, the commissioner said.

     A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added.

     Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support 
having generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The 
commission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's 
troubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence 
that would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to 
documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.

     Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate 
the market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said 
rates were "unjust and unreasonable."

     The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also 
concluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in 
order to drive up wholesale power prices.

     The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to 
pass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers.

     The commissioner said "if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the 
utilities would be left holding the bag."

     PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale 
power. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a 
state-mandated rate freeze.

     As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive 
Officer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover 
more than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay 
off employees and reduce major capital spending.

     PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow 
the utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers.

Here are the results of our efforts so far:

Discussions with Local Counsel:
 Here is the list of firms and individuals that we have contacted as
well as the results of conflict checks and availability.  In short, There
are some conflict issues with several of the firms.  One firm was directly
conflicted.  Another has as one of its partners, the wife of Len Simon, the
lead plaintiff's counsel in our case.  Assuming that conflicts can be
resolved, we have five different lawyers available to be interviewed on
Monday.

 <<status11.30.doc>>
Economic Experts

 Local

  Retained:  Carey P.  Mack,  Bruno & Mack
  The best testifying expert in town, economic accounting
damages.  Relates best to San Diego jury.   Not an anti-trust
model building type of expert.

  Tom Lambert
   Solo (he is checking conflict list right now.  If no
conflict, he is willing to work for us.)

  Broadshatzer, Wallace, Spoon & Yip
   Roberta Spoon (on vacation)
 National
  Charles River
    Gordon Rausser will be meeting with CEO of
Enron, Ken Lay on other matters on Friday 10:00a.m. in Houston on another
matter.  They are very interested in being retained.  They are doing
conflict check. He is willing to stop by and see you if that would be
helpful.
  NERA
   Waiting for response

Non-testifying Consultants

 Larry Ruff
  RETAINED: to assist in reviewing EPMI data.

Procedural Issues:

 We are investigating to see whether there are any California
defendants to consider removal.  Because we  attended  the press
conference (momentarily and obtained a copy of the complaint) we should
assume that  the removal clock is ticking.
News Reports

 We have identified a service that has recorded the news reports
about this lawsuit.  There are 28 hits so far for TV reports.  It will cost
$300 per clip to obtain them.  Do you know if Enron is getting these clips
from the public relations firm?  Should we get them?

Anti-Trust Law School Professors.

 We have identified Tom Campbell (ran against Diane Feinstein for
Senate.  We have a number for him in Washington good until tomorrow.  He was
former Director Competitive Compliance Division FTC, has Harvard Ph.D. in
Economics.  Should we contact him?

Thanks

Subject: Revised Motion


Please review the attached and give me your comments ASAP.  I would like to 
file tomorrow.  Seab: Please read carefully for economic content.

Mary: I incorporated your comments from last night along with the matters 
that we discussed by phone yesterday.  However, I just received your fax and 
wanted to get this moving since incorporating those edits would slow down the 
process by several edits.  I'll take a look at your edits while you review 
the attached.

I spoke with Neha Nissen at McCutchen Doyle (Terry was out).  She actually
did the responses and is forwarding them to us.  (They may be the same ones
that Mike Day forwarded attached to his email).  She said that they had
received two subpoenas - the August 18th version and the September 22
version.  To the August 18th, they provided general information documents,
objected formally to the protective order.  She said they had trading data
ready to turn over provided the protective order was changed.  With respect
to the September 22nd version, she said that they objected as duplicative of
the first and its overbreadth.  They objected on burden, trade secret and
jurisdictional grounds.

I also spoke with Gordon Erspamer.  He said that they were following
Williams lead in a me too fashion.  He suggested that Terry and Norm Peters
from Jones Day in Los Angeles were taking the lead for generators etc.

Thanks
Gary

I am a private citizen with no direct financial interest in the energy
situation in California. However, I possess what is probably an average
sense of decency regarding public behavior and was outraged to read the
public comments of Californian Attorney General, Bill Lockyer, in the Wall
Street Journal regarding your CEO. I am not hopeful that much will come of
my complaint to the State Bar of California regarding Mr. Lockyer's behavior
but feel better for asking the Bar to examine Mr. Lockyer's shameful
behavior.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FERC Settlement Developments
SoCal Ed. MOU/Plan B
The CPUC's New Rate Proposal

FERC Developments
FERC's publicly recognized autonomy regarding California power talks likely has a less public, less autonomous, role in determining the outcome of debated refunds.  The following analysis emphasizes the multiple dimensions and variables now at play in the California settlement negotiations:

The Bush Administration does have influence over what FERC decides -- especially now that Pat Wood and other Republicans are there. The influence is certainly not formal (as FERC is supposed to be an independent agency), but the commissioners generally do not issue decisions without taking the "political lay of the land" -- particularly regarding the positions of the White House.
Bush and Davis do not like each other (no surprise there). Communication between the Davis Administration, the White House and FERC is not free flowing. Interaction between FERC and White House is frequent -- but with Davis only on an as-needed basis. (Staff level contacts are more regular -- especially staff of the Democrat commissioners).
Administrative Law Judge C. Wagner will probably recommend a refund at under or close to $1 B -- and the Commission will not go higher than what the judge recommends. This would be for October forward. Wagner thinks there may be additional refunds ordered later.  
Wagner has also strongly advised FERC and Bush (as well as his top advisors) that they will have to put price caps on, stick with them and show real efforts to deal with this issue (even though those steps run afoul of the "free market" position of the Admin -- and his own members). He has a great deal of influence with Bush.  

MOU & Pan B
Late Thursday (7/12) Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg called a briefing for business community leaders regarding a new proposal to alter the terms of the Edison MOU.  The new proposal (now ABXX 82) reduces the value of SoCal's transmission system to 2 times book value (the state had previously agreed to pay 2.3 times the book value, or $2.76B).  Given the dire financial condition of the Socal Edison's parent company (EIX), the legislature now realizes that they are unlikely to see any cash infusion above the $420M already promised by EIX.  Assembly moderate Democrats led by Keeley and Hertzberg feel that a $4.5B generator refund, a profit from the State's sale of the SoCal transmission lines, and an additional $1B from a dedicated rate component are all distant, but hopeful possibilities that could fuel progress for a SoCal bail-out.  Of course, two thirds of these suggestions require FERC approval.


PG&E predictably views the new proposal "DOA" because it is a less attractive model to be applied in their bankruptcy proceedings than the initial SoCal MOU.  Alternately, at least one of Edison's executives indicated that SCE was confident that there would be a legislative proposal flowing from the MOU that the utility would ultimately be able to accept. He went on to describe the contours of such a proposal: It has to "make it look like Edison is getting hurt" to counter consumer group criticism that it is a bailout. This would be accomplished by providing something less than the $3.8 billion in under-collections. He also noted that the tricky part would be picking the right percentage below 100% -- go too low, and the generators drag SCE into bankruptcy.

CPUC Rates
The PUC will likely publish shortly (in a matter of days) a new rate agreement giving the DWR first call over the utilities on any money available for purchasing power.  If this rate agreement leaves SoCal with too little cash to operate going forward, the likelihood will increase that SoCal will file for bankruptcy protection.  It does not appear that there is enough cash for purchasing power under the current structure for both DWR and SoCal to remain solvent; therefore, in order to save SoCal from bankruptcy, the legislation governing DWR's power purchases will likely have to be revised.

McCUTCHEN, DOYLE, BROWN & ENERSEN, LLP

Attached for your comments is a revised complaint in inverse condemnation, 
with the PX and Reliant as plaintiffs.? I am sending it separately to Susan 
Rossi, in-house counsel for the PX.? Since our last conference call we've 
discussed the various forums and pending actions with FERC counsel for 
Reliant and Enron. My understanding is that the PX wants us to act and will 
cooperate with us.? 

Marc, I haven't circulated this to the whole group because I wanted to go 
through you.? What is the appropriate next step?? A call with the 
decisionmakers on this issue so that we can make a plan to move forward?? Can 
we do that Monday or Tuesday?

I've set out Reliant's conclusions here.? 

1. There is no forum other than California state court in which we can get 
compensation for the commandeered contracts because of the Eleventh Amendment 
issue.

2. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with the FERC 
proceeding in Tucson Electric. 

3. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with Duke v. 
Davis or with any other proceeding anyone may want to bring alleging that the 
commandeering itself was illegal (e.g. on preemption grounds).

4.? As we discussed, nobody (including PG&E and SCE) wants the Board of 
Control to be deciding anything if we can avoid it.? We would suggest going 
along with the PX's suggestion that the bankruptcy court should be staying 
the Board of Control action because of the interventions of SCE and PG&E, who 
are taking the position that the compensation should go to them.? Then, we 
can go forward with the inverse condemnation action in state court (we picked 
LA as the forum because LA residents are less affected by the energy crisis 
than most others in the state, and because it's convenient). If PG&E and SCE 
are permitted to intervene in the state court action, we can stipulate to 
relief from stay so that it can go forward.? This way, the Board of Control 
is effectively stayed while the state court action goes forward.

5.? Richard Sanders expressed the very real concern that we don't want SCE 
and PG&E's defenses to liquidation of the block forward contracts to be 
decided anywhere but FERC.? We think we should be able to avoid that: since 
SCE and PG&E have already put the issue squarely before FERC, that defense 
could be stayed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine pending FERC's 
decision.? We would argue that the whole case need not be stayed in the 
meantime, since the governor's duty to compensate holds no matter who is owed 
the compensation, and any proceeds from PX contracts will be funneled into 
the Moreno escrow account.

6.? As we also discussed, we can file this complaint in the name of the PX, 
Reliant, and any other market participants who want to be plaintiffs (we just 
need names and a few facts to allege for each plaintiff). Or, as someone 
suggested, if the PX Market Participants Committee is an entity that has 
standing, it could be filed in that name along with the PX.? Either way, the 
prayer for relief asks that all funds be deposited in the Moreno escrow 
account for disposition consistent with FERC's decision in Coral Power.

Here is a summary  of recent developments:

Natural Gas and Electricity Class Action Complaint Against El Paso
 Two plaintiffs attorneys filed a class action complaint alleging
anti-trust and unfair competition against El Paso and 100 Does for inflating
natural gas prices and the price of electricity.  The complaint alleges that
this was done by withholding capacity on the El Paso and Trans Western
pipelines.

Ron Carroll's Analysis of Private Cause of Action
 One of the assignments from our Portland meeting was to find out
whether or not there was a private right of action (or prohibition of same)
under the Federal Power Act.  Here is Ron Carroll's response:

 The courts have refused to create a private cause of action for
violations of the FPA, stating that the regulatory scheme created by
Congress vested the regulatory body with the power to pursue enforcement.
See Clark v. Gulf Oil Corp., 570 F.2d 1138, 1149 (1977) (pertaining to the
recovery of losses due to allegedly unlawful rates under the NGA); City of
Gainesville v. Florida Power & Light Co., 488 F. Supp. 1258, 1277-78 (S.D.
Fla. 1980) (noting that the legislative history of the NGA, which was
modeled after the FPA, does not suggest the existence of any private rights
of action).
Dave Noonan's Report on Defense Counsel Teleconference on Monday
 Chris Healy has just advised me that the call will take place on
Monday, December
 18 at 10:30 am (PST) to discuss removal issues in the Hendricks
case.  The
 dial-in number for the call is 1-866-855-6338, password 8315.

 Also, Morgan Stanley is rep'd by Jeff Davidson of Kirkland&Ellis
[L.A].
Data Preservation
 Steve Hall and others have been working on making sure that the
California AG's request to preserve evidence has been complied with.  EPMI
will probably be extending the period that it keeps backup tapes, making
copies of hard drives from individual computers etc.
FERC Developments
 Secretary of Energy Richardson issued an emergency order requiring
EPMI to market energy to  the ISO.  In addition, another emergency order was
issued today.  I enclose the order and the press release. The Press release
for today's order is included below. The FERC special meeting on California
was videotaped by Nancy Pickover of Bracewell and is being sent to us.

Dan Watkiss Analysis of FERC Order re Penalties for Refusal to sell Energy
 Last Friday, the ISO filed with FERC Amendment No. 33 to its tariff.
Among other things, the Amendment adds to the section 5 of the  tariff  new
provisions empowering the ISO to assess a penalty against Participating
Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction
during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or
threatened System Emergency.   The penalty is stiff:  (1) a charge for each
MWh of the Dispatch instruction with which the Participating Generator does
not comply equal to twice the highest price for Energy, per MWh, paid in
each hour by the ISO to any other entity to produce Energy; and (2) if the
ISO is required t call for the involuntary curtailment of firm Load to
maintain Applicable Reliability Criteria during the System Emergency, then
an additional charge equal to $1,000 for each MWh of the Dispatch
instruction with which the Participating Generator does not comply.  The
only defense to these penalties is to provide proof that the generating unit
in question was physically incapable of running or it would have violated
state or federal law to run it (e.g., air emission allowance limits).  The
ISO asked FERC for an immediate effective date of December 8, which FERC
granted in a December 8 order.

 The ISO Tariff defines "Participating Seller or Generator" to mean
"A generator or other seller of Energy or Ancillary Services through a
Scheduling Coordinator over the ISO Controlled Grid and which has undertaken
to be bound by the terms of the ISO Tariff."  If Enron is a Participating
Generator (Mary Hain informs me that Enron is not one), then it risks
incurring the new penalty if it fails to respond to an ISO order to sell
ancillary services to  the ISO.  I believe Enron might also risk incurring
the penalty in cases where it controls or has rights to all or a portion of
a generating capacity of a Participating Generator's unit.  If that capacity
is called on and the call is not answered because Enron is making some other
use of the capacity, the Enron may incur the penalty .  This seems to be
contemplated by section 4.1.1 of the Participating Generator Agreement which
obliges a Participating Generator to comply with the tariff (section 5.3) by
identifying the Generating Units that it owns, operates or has a contractual
entitlement to in Schedule 1, as required by Section 5.3 of the ISO Tariff.
(emphasis added).   As far as I know, it is that Schedule 1 that the ISO
consults when making decisions as to which Participating Generator to call
on.

Thanks

Oh, Lord!  We have to keep the pressure on -- particularly what a bad idea it 
is to lower price caps in times of resource shortage. Do we have a Jimmie 
Carter analogy we can use?

FYI

Calif. ISO may vote again on power price cap cut


     LOS ANGELES, July 10 (Reuters) - The California Independent System 
Operator (ISO) Board of Governors may try for a third time to pass a motion 
to cut a cap on power prices to $250 per megawatt hour (MWh) from its current 
$500 per MWh.

     "It wouldn't surprise me if in the next few days there is a request to 
add it to the August 1 agenda," a member of the ISO Board of Governors said 
on Monday.

     The California ISO operates most of the state's power grid.

     Last week its governing board voted by 12 votes to nine, with one 
abstention, in favor of lowering the cap but failed to secure the 13 votes 
necessary to pass under the motion under ISO rules.

     The previous week a vote to cut the cap to $250 per MWh failed to pass 
after a 12-12 vote but a new meeting was called after one member, Marcie 
Edwards of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, declared she had 
incorrectly cast her vote against the lower cap.

     Two members were absent overseas during last week's vote. One, John 
McGuire of Silicon Valley Power, had supported the cut to $250 at the June 28 
vote. He is due to return from vacation on July 26.

     The other absent member, Daniel Kirschner of the Environmental Defense 
Fund, is due to return from overseas during the next couple of days, sources 
said.

     It was not clear which way Kirschner is likely to vote as he was also 
absent from the June 28 vote. The board at 25 members on the June 28 vote, 
but one member resigned before the subsequent vote.

     Pressure to cut the cap has come from several sources including state 
Sen. Steve Peace, whose San Diego constituents have been angered by sharply 
higher electricity bills recently.

     Under rules governing the deregulation of the state's power industry 
customers of San Diego Gas and Electric are currently the only ones exposed 
to market prices.

     "He (Peace) is getting all kinds of hate mail and is really trying to do 
something," an industry source said.

     San Diego Gas and Electric is a unit of Sempra Energy .

     Rates for customers of California's other two investor owned utilities, 
Edison International's Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific 
Gas and Electric, are currently frozen.

     Other proponents of cutting the cap including Loretta Lynch, president 
of the California Public Utilities Commission and a close aide to Governor 
Gray Davis.

     San Diego Gas and Electric has called an emergency summit of energy 
market participants -- including power generators, energy service providers 
and representatives of the California Independent System Operator and 
California Power Exchange - on Wednesday to explore solutions to the soaring 
prices.

     Supporters of cutting the cap believe the power market is not "workably 
competitive" and prices rose to excessive levels during a recent heatwave, 
putting an unfair burden on both ratepayers and shareholders of investor 
owned utilities.

     Opponents are led by independent power producers who have argued a lower 
cap could make it more difficult for the state to import power at times of 
shortage.

All:  We are targeting to file this on Monday, 9 April.

Ron:

I am forwarding to you two files:

The first is a draft of EPMI's answer.  I hope I have made your job easier by 
providing you with a first draft..  I expect that you'll do your usual magic 
turning it into a legal pleading.

The second is Seabron's affidavit, including my comments. .  Seabron needs to 
live by the suggested edits, of course, so he get's veto rights over the 
weekend.  

Gary, Richard S.:

Please review w.r.t. litigation compatiblity.

Seabron,

Please start with my version and let me know any major issues you have with 
my suggested edits.

Tim, Sue, Ray:  Please review.  Tim, make sure you look at paragraphs 26-30.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE


DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT




Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EESI"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").  We
make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with
the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering
to produce or producing documents, these entities have not waived any
objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims,
defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have
been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.
For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from
disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges.


GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Data
will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, ESSI, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchase
and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   We anticipate
producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and
the transaction data in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are very small and there will probably be limited documents
available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling
coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, do
not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit
requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.
 For Portland General, there will be a very large volume of documents
and we propose to handle them differently.  First, Portland General will
provide for year 2000 electronic data in summary form similar to the data
being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant.  With respect
to specific generating cost data, because of the volume, we suggest that
these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a
representative sampling of facilities.  If there are specific documents that
the Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss the
arrangements for producing these documents.  We propose to make these
documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Request 13, 15, 16, 17, 19

 We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data for
year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity,
delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is purchase or sale.   Because
of the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that some
entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those transactions where EPMI
served only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO will
show part of the transaction, but there will not be a corresponding
transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.  The reason is that
this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on an
accounting system rather than as part of the trading business.  EESI can
also provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will not
include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide
a blind customer number.  Many of ESSI's customers have agreements whereby
they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.
ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its
customers the notice they require.  We anticipate producing the transaction
data in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT



Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

   Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron Energy Services
Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy Marketing
Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
"Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

   I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and
phone calls between Michael Day, on behalf of the Enron Entities, and
yourself during the past few weeks.  Here is the current status as we
understand it.  Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6,
2000 and October 18, 2000 (date of your confirming email) the Enron
Entities have made the following document productions in response to the
subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission (the
"Commission"):

*  October 13, 2000  Bate Nos. Enron Entities 000001-000025 on behalf
of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos. 1-11, 20.

*  October 27, 2000 Bate Nos. P000001-002115 on behalf of Portland
General Responsive to Request Nos. 12, 14, 16 and 18.

*  November 14, 2000 Bate No. Enron Entities 000026 (Diskette with
EES/EEMC retail data) Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 11, 13, 15 to 17,
and 19.

*  November 15, 2000 Bate No. P002116-002117 (Diskettes with Portland
General Data, which include approximate 355,000 wholesale transactions)
Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 11, 13 to 17, and 19.

We believe with these productions, we have complied with the October
6-18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES/EEMC.  As you
know, these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights
to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims, defenses,
objections, jurisdictional or otherwise, or other responses.

   We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for
EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by
October 27th.  However, we were also mindful of your expressed
expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable.  The collection
of data
you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same
location nor organized as you requested it.  In fact during our review of
some of the data we found significant errors that called into question
the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.
When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it
would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions
involved, we informed you of the problem.  We now understand that if we
cannot give
you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be
available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to
compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission
("FERC").  We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data
immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the
immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce
accurate data.

   Moreover, during the interim between October 18th and today, a number
of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas
served on the Enron entities.  First, we understand that many other
parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the
detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very
sound legal grounds.  Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing
on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is
supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes
sought by other parties served.  Third, the Commission has filed its
motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data
from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited
hearing and production schedule.  We note that the reasons stated in the
motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different
than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the
Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.  FERC
has also issued its tentative order as of November 1, 2000 covering some of
the same topics as the Commission's subpoena request.  Finally, FERC has
requested information in 6 specific areas from a number of entities
including Enron. Enron is simultaneously working on preparing responses to
FERC's requests.

   Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept "most
favored nation" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests
by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information
that was available.  However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need
for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite
substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate
Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described
intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its
formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's
threatened motion to compel before FERC.

   We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission
has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been
served with subpoenas.  We understand that there is a list for those
entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been
delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising
their rights to challenge the subpoenas.  We understand that the Commission
intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities
that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.  We
deplore
these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described
above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating
list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.

   If you have and questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

                                      Sincerely,


                                      Gary S. Fergus

Summary of Oral Arguments and All-Party Meeting before the CPUC taking place 
on January 3, 2001: 

Oral Arguments were held at the CPUC today for purposes of commenting on 
today's draft final order.? The oral arguments were presided over by ALJ 
Walwyn.? The All-Party Meeting, which was presided over by Commissioner Wood, 
was not eventful.? Many of the participants left after the Oral Arguments and 
those who remained mostly responded to comments made during the Oral 
Arguments.? 

Both SCE and PG&E argued that the CPUC erroneously failed to address an end 
to the rate freeze, recovery of past undercollections, and right to recover 
their full future procurement costs.? Both also argued that the surcharge 
will be inadequate to satisfy the financial community.? In addition, SCE 
requested that the CPUC relieve it of the obligation to procure power for its 
customers which is priced above the amount that they can recover from their 
customers.? PG&E argued the proposal failed to provide certainty for recovery 
of costs and criticized the CPUC's focus on accounting arguing that changes 
to the accounting methods were not a solution. 

The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (CPUC Division) ("ORA") suggested several 
additional solutions for the CPUC to consider as a final solution:? (1)? 
encourage the utilities to issue revenue bonds; (2) reduce utilities' return 
on equity by one-half; and (3) encourage energy conservation which addresses 
the alleged price gouging.? ORA also argued that the utility companies needed 
to do more to cut corporate costs.

The California Industrial Users ("CIU") generally supported the proposal but 
criticized it for discriminating against larger customers and argued that the 
CPUC needs to look out for the welfare of all customers, not just smaller 
customers.? Both Reliant and Enron argued that the current situation is a 
short term problem and should be addressed with only interim relief.? Both 
also argued that the surcharge is not adequate and should be re-examined.? 
Enron complimented the CPUC on its decision not to lift the rate freeze.

The citizen advocates and consumer advocates (Greenlining Institute, Aglet 
Consumer Alliance, Golden State Power Cooperative, California Farm 
Federation) were generally satisfied with the proposed final decision.? They 
commended the CPUC for not lifting the rate freeze and for insisting on 
thorough and continuing investigations but argued the CPUC also needs to 
study the impact rate increases would have on the California economy, not 
just its affect on the utility companies.? TURN blamed the marketers and the 
utility companies for the crisis and argued that consumers shouldn't be 
forced to bail out the utility companies for their own bad decisions.? 

A private attorney from San Diego who filed a lawsuit against out of state 
generators to recover alleged windfall profits suggested the CPUC not grant a 
rate surcharge until the utility companies actually declared bankruptcy and 
argued that filing for bankruptcy could provide an incentive for the utility 
companies to press their case against the marketers.? Commissioner Wood 
however expressed concern about the implications of bankruptcy on labor 
contracts and QF contracts.

and Press Conference=09


The following are summaries of today's appearance by Sen. John Burton to th=
e Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcin=
g a lawsuit against FERC.
=20
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at a lunch with the =
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about the Edison MOU, wh=
ich he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review, th=
e Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the Natural Reso=
urces Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.  (One columnist =
commented that Burton would "love it to death," meaning it would get so muc=
h attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
=20
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC.  =
He said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate.
=20
Burton is obviously troubled by the MOU; he said "some people" say it doesn=
't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.  He said the followi=
ng would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable:
=20
Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% "haircut";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to wh=
at the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay back debt.
=20
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said "no" and that he feels =
the parent should pay "a ton."  That led to a discussion of the dedicated r=
ate component, which he doesn't like. He used the example that if electrici=
ty costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is $5, if prices drop to $10 =
people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.  A larger infusion of cash from=
 Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component.=
=20
=20
Burton called the dedicated rate component a "big problem" and said it coul=
d be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign.
=20
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state shoul=
d set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more (not=
e:  this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio=
 talk shows and other media).  He later threw out the number $200.  The sta=
te is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar, he said, s=
o this is one way he sees to fight back.  It's tough medicine, but as he pu=
t it, "You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy, but two days lat=
er you're over it and your stomach's OK."
=20
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how he believe the=
 situation should be handled:  "The only way to deal with exploiters is to =
terrorize the bastards."
=20
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU, Burton said th=
e MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress th=
ere are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December.
=20
=20
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
=20
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsu=
it against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth =
Circuit.  A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afte=
rnoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.  If additional =
copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
=20
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the Senate; Bob He=
rtzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City of Oaklan=
d.  At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, atty. J=
oe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty. Clark Kelso, =
a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz Figueroa; an=
d Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland. =20
=20
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling within 21 days=
.
=20
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling it=
s statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.  Hertzberg ad=
ded that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit=
 for Californians' relief.
=20
Joe Cotchett said the suit is "very basic" and is based on the Federal Powe=
r Act, which he says limits power costs to "fair and justifiable" rates.  A=
 primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a "health and welfare" a=
nd public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million disabled children =
and 12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blacko=
uts.  He said it is "not an economic lawsuit -- it's about senior citizens,=
 disabled kids and convalescent facilities."  Today also happened to be the=
 legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities (the n=
ursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were apparently =
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
=20
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were opportunities =
to exert market power.  He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility (obvi=
ously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant off-line and s=
ubstituting higher rates.  He said, however, that this order had been seale=
d.
=20
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of blackouts this summe=
r, which could mean four hours a day.  That could be, he said, "potentially=
 the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration."  Cotchett noted that=
 only hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from blackouts, which do=
es not protect surgical centers or many health facilities.
=20
Jerry Brown added that "prices are unjust and people are suffering."  Conti=
nued high prices could mean "potential civic disruption," and that there wi=
ll be "more actions to mobilize" Western mayors.
=20
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit.
=20
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV here as a leg=
al expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his =
Press Club appearance.  He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media e=
arly on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit. Burton's la=
wyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it to join the legal=
 team.
=20
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for thr=
ee years, and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably.  It has =
failed to define "fair and justifiable"; that failure, he said, violates th=
e Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution.
=20
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon "fellow Republican=
s" to support the effort.
=20
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she believed that =
if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California, the=
 president and FERC would have acted long ago.
=20
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary becau=
se "5 generators supply 90%" of the electricity in CA and all five have rat=
e renewals before FERC.  He also said one of the cases that is relevant is =
Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standard=
s (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal Protect=
ion clause.  He also said six states have expressed interest in the case an=
d have requested briefs:  Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Minnesota an=
d one other he didn't name.  None of these states has yet committed to join=
ing the suit.

Here it is:

I have some dope on the judge as well.  He was a very small time lawyer out
in La Mesa (the sticks) with a general practice that  included litigation.
He was a family law judge until he was made an overflow general civil judge
in 1998.  None of the lawyers whom I have listed would be likely to have a
relationship with him from their days in practice.  Also, he may not keep
the case, given its high profile, and the fact that it is related to the
case filed against the generators, which has a lower number.  People who
know Judge Meyer say he is pompous and not very bright.

He practiced with three lawyers. One of them went on the bench and is now
retired.  Another has also retired.  The remaining one is LeRoy Knutson, who
is of counsel in a small firm in El Cajon, also the sticks.

Thanks
Gary

Sent:=09Tuesday, July 24, 2001 6:25 PM
To:=09ISO Market Participants
Subject:=09CAISO Notice - Cash Allocation Policies

ISO Market Participants:
Since Trade Month November 2000 (which settled beginning in January 2001), =
payment defaults in the ISO markets have caused the ISO to pay less than th=
e full amount due Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) in the monthly cash clearin=
g process.  The purpose of this message is to describe the ISO's policies a=
nd procedures in settling the market when defaults occur.  As set forth in =
Section SABP 6.7.4 of the ISO Tariff, when payment defaults occur from SCs =
that have obligations to the ISO's markets (Debtor SCs), the shortfall is t=
o be prorated to SCs with net amounts due them (Creditor SCs) based on thei=
r outstanding balances. The principles that drive how amounts are settled a=
nd defaults are allocated to Creditor SCs are summarized below:
Proportionate allocation of defaults - The total amount of market defaults =
is allocated to the Creditor SCs on a proportionate basis such that each Cr=
editor SC receives the same percentage of their total net amount receivable=
 for the month.  SCs are allowed to net the credits and debits on a monthly=
 basis as described below.  The intent of the Tariff is to equitably distri=
bute market shortfalls only to those SCs that have net market receivables f=
or the period. =20
Each month is treated as a whole period - Final and preliminary invoices ar=
e combined when possible (see exception conditions below) in allocating mar=
ket defaults.  Cash payments from the market are received in two stages (pr=
eliminary and final).  At preliminary, market payments are distributed base=
d on the preliminary amounts due to the Creditor SCs as set forth in the pr=
eliminary invoices. Final invoices serve essentially as true-ups to the pre=
liminary invoices, and accordingly, payments received at final are redistri=
buted to the extent possible to achieve true-up allocations for the whole m=
onth considering the combined amounts due the Creditor SCs from both the pr=
eliminary and final invoices.
Each month is treated as a discrete period - Market defaults are generally =
allocated to the Creditor SCs that have amounts due for the month being set=
tled.  The exceptions to this rule involve (1) SCs that are Creditor SCs in=
 the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods o=
r (2) Debtor SCs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for=
 prior months.  In the first instance, the Creditor SC would not be paid to=
 the extent of default obligations from prior months.  Amounts due to the C=
reditor SC would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds =
would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period. I=
n the second instance the current month's payment is carried back and appli=
ed first to the oldest outstanding balance. The proceeds would be distribut=
ed to the Creditor SCs for that earlier period based on the Creditor SCs un=
paid balances in that month.  With respect to the carry back of payments to=
 the earliest period, Pre and Post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from d=
ifferent SCs.
GMC defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments  - GMC is =
billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final invoic=
es each month.  In the event of payment default on any GMC invoices (at eit=
her preliminary or final), market funds are transferred to satisfy GMC obli=
gations before any market distributions are made.  This first priority posi=
tion for GMC revenues is set forth in Section SABP 6.3.1.3 of the ISO Tarif=
f.  Therefore, when both GMC and market defaults occur (as has occurred in =
each of the past few months), the Creditor SCs have two reductions to the m=
arket clearing amounts ultimately paid - an allocated portion of the GMC de=
fault, and an allocated portion of the market default.  RMR invoices and pa=
yments are not affected by market or GMC defaults - The RMR invoicing proce=
ss involves amounts due from the PTO's to the RMR Owners as set forth in mo=
nthly invoices processed through the ISO's systems.  However, such amounts =
are invoiced independent of the ISO's market and GMC billing processes, and=
 accordingly, market and/or GMC defaults do not impact RMR related payments=
.=20
There are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of alloca=
ting cash to Creditor SCs when defaults occur.  Some of these factors inclu=
de:
* amounts received after payment date deadlines - such amounts are typicall=
y included in the next distribution
* market payments due to Creditor SCs that default on GMC in the current mo=
nth - such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount of the GMC=
 default by the Creditor SC
* allocations to prior months - not made unless the amount exceeds
0.5% of that months billed amounts
* small invoices under $5,000 are paid in full rather than the allocated pe=
rcentage.
For more information about these allocation issues or any other related mat=
ters, please contact Melodie Iverson (916) 351-2174 (e-mail mkiverson@caiso=
.com <mailto:miverson@caiso.com> ) or Mike Epstein (916) 351-2314 (e-mail m=

Richard and Elizabeth:  
While I was away on vacation, Steve Hall included this statement in a status 
report to me;  

" >While you were gone I learned a new one from Smith Day, which involves 
submitting bids for less than one MW, i.e., .0005 MW.  Because of a glitch in 
the ISO's rounding system, the MW get rounded down, but the payment gets 
rounded up.  Playing this game is worth about $9000/day. "

9,000 X 365 = 3,250,000.

Let's discuss.  ----cgy

I have thoroughly reviewed the sections that Steve Hall referred me to on our 
call, particularly section 5 of Schedule 2 (PX Clearinghouse, Credit 
Policies, Business Practices and Banking) of the Cal PX FERC Electric Service 
Tariff No. 2.  Because of the former mandate that the IOUs (now excluding 
SDG&E) buy power only from the  PX, Edison and PG&E have procured ISO 
real-time services, not directly, but through the PX's Core Services.  To the 
extent that any PX participant defaults on its payment obligation to the PX 
for real-time ISO services and the default exceeds the sum of the (1) 
participant's collateral (5.2.1), (2) the Pool Performance Bond (5.2.2), and 
any set off from liquidating the defaulting participant's positions in the 
DA, DO, and CTS markets, the remaining or residual default amount is 
expressly chargeable to all other non-defaulting participants using the 
proportional chargeback methodology of the tariff (5.3).  This is different 
from my conclusion from yesterday with respect to an Edison or PG&E default 
in the CTS market solely for the reason that the proportional chargeback is 
expressly provided for in the PX tariff for Core Services, while (as 
explained in my 1/18/01 memo) it is not provided for in the CTS tariff or 
rate schedule.

Some of the invoices that I have seen to some of our other clients simply 
provide a lump sum proportional chargeback, without specifying whether it is 
for Core Services, CTS or both.   If you receive such an invoice, try to 
confirm whether any of it is for a participant's default on a CTS obligation 
and, if so, pay that amount (if at all) under protest.

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

FYI - It sounds like this consultant's findings are being questioned by many 
in the industry, including by the CAISO.

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs
Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

( October 17, 2000 )



Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has 
come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating 
capacity this summer.

The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared 
and the state's power manager declared 36 separate "power emergencies" 
because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, 
according to the investigation.

The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based 
economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a 
conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators 
Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies 
manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a 
false shortage and push up prices.

The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well 
below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices 
---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating 
plant's cost of production.

The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an 
analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors 
emissions.

"We are seeing a lot of under-generation," McCullough said. "This is market 
power in action."

Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market 
participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices.

Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed 
their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and 
contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has 
reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. 
Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal 
agencies, including the EPA.

Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego 
County are scant.

Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG 
Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no 
abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said 
Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution 
limits.

But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina 
plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets.

"That can't possibly be right," Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. "In 
North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency 
shutdown because of heavy output).

"Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, 
I can't comment," Lloyd said.

"We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful," he said. "We 
don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in 
California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We 
want to run all we can when the prices are high."

Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a 
doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million 
customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion 
in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.

State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with 
a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow 
beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist.

No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to 
assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western 
states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies 
which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit 
deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright 
manipulation in order to increase profits.

Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity 
Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff 
investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they 
are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data.

McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium 
of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate 
the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an 
exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount 
of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that 
was actually used.

Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this 
summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, 
a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web 
of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western 
states, British Columbia and northern Mexico.

McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North 
County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was 
one of deep skepticism.

"EPA data is notoriously unreliable," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor 
and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California 
Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which 
has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual 
output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data 
from the EPA.

"Greed would get the best of anybody," Wolak said. "I found a lot of hours 
where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were 
cranking it out."

Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, 
however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was 
the major cause of higher prices this summer.

At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize 
McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing 
higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real 
shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states.

Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures 
in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import 
electricity.

Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants 
themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard 
market information that is in short supply.

Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said 
market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and 
buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading 
companies.

"If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that," 
Eachus said.

Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the 
largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the 
unique stand that more information which has been labeled "proprietary" by 
companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is 
selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets.

"Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving 
rationally?" Belden said.

"California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody 
understands," he said. "If you've got nothing to hide, release the data."

USA: UPDATE 1-Calif. seizes stranded SoCal Edison energy contracts.
  
02/02/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 


SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis on Friday blocked 
the California Power Exchange from liquidating stranded energy contracts held 
by cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison, seizing the assets for 
the state.


The governor's office said the order, issued late on Thursday and put in 
effect on Friday, was needed to "preserve" the contracts' value for 
power-starved California consumers.


"I am using my emergency powers to seize options to buy very inexpensive 
power that would otherwise be lost forever," Davis said in a statement.


"These options will provide reliable power through the end of the year. It is 
important to protect these contracts for the people of California," he said.


A Los Angeles judge on January 24 issued a temporary injunction, valid for a 
week, blocking the exchange's sale of the contracts.


The California Power Exchange (CalPX) said Davis' order nullified a Los 
Angeles County Superior Court decision earlier Friday that authorized CalPX 
to liquidate Edison's forward market positions.


The exchange said they had sought to liquidate the contracts to recover about 
$255 million that Edison has failed to pay to CalPX market participants.


While agreeing to transfer the contracts to the state, the exchange pointed 
out that the law requires that California pay a "reasonable value" for them, 
which it estimated at nearly $652 million on today's market.


Delivery of the first contracts, which total 2.8 million megawatt hours, is 
scheduled to begin Monday, February 5.


One megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to light 1,000 
homes for 60 minutes.


Davis is desperately seeking cheap power for the state after the utilities' 
financial meltdown pushed them to the market's sidelines. Spot market 
purchases for the state are currently being made by the Department of Water 
Resources, but at typically higher prices than in the "forwards" market.


Block forward energy contracts secure electricity deliveries over a given 
"block" of time at a price agreed months in advance, shielding the buyer from 
the kind of price volatility that has recently roiled the short-term "spot" 
market.


The overall value of SoCal Edison's contracts, agreed last year for power to 
be delivered in 2001, was not immediately known, but CalPX officials said 
last month they hoped their liquidation would cover the $215 million 
SoCalEdison owned the exchange.


SoCal Edison, the utility subsidiary of Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison 
International, has warned it is no longer able to meet its financial 
obligations after running up a debt of nearly $5 billion buying wholesale 
power in the spot market, where prices have soared ten-fold over the past few 
months amid a regional energy shortage.


The utility is blocked by the state's 1996 deregulation law from passing 
these high wholesale prices down to consumers, who are still protected by a 
rate freeze.


That same deregulation legislation created the CalPX, making it the 
state-sanctioned exchange for electricity trading. SoCal Edison was among the 
biggest buyers on the exchange.


CalPX, crushed by a mountain of debt it is unable to recover from Edison, has 
shut its spot market operations and is winding down its business affairs.

After speaking with George Phillips yesterday about SCE's counterclaim
against EES and EEMC regarding underreporting of usage to the ISO, I think
there may be some internal confusion (of which I may have contributed to)
about the nature of SCE's counterclaim.

As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE in
response to our data requests, review of an "Executive Summary" prepared by
George Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday,
EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, did
indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period
claimed by SCE.  This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (although
interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the
subject matter of its counterclaim.

First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges
to the market.  In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the
last quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the "cost to the
market" from the  EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead
market clearing price to the  individual  hourly variances.  This cost to
the market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account the
fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts
to get a net amount of underreporting.  This underreported amount is then
allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory
through the assessment of UFE charges.  Thus whatever the ultimate cost was
determined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount.

Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, in
SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased.  This
claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in
the way of UFE charges.  What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and
EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which
they reported to the ISO.  EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than
the amount which EES and EEMC reported.  SCE calculated the PX credit based
on the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are
not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC,
purchased those volumes.

It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of
SCE's counterclaim.  SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX
credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase.  SCE
is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO.  While
SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result
of  EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of its
counterclaim.

Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece of
information  to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreporting
of volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA
customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim?  and do we
have data to back it up?

Mike,
 All of us working on the San Diego defense of Enron have been
attempting to watch the other class actions that we know have been filed
related to the California electricity and gas markets.  The reason is that
if there is a state court class action that is broad enough to sweep Enron
in as a doe defendant and that case is not removed, then even if we are
successful in our efforts in Hendricks and elsewhere it may all be for
nought.   The Rojoin case is somewhat different than the rest of the cases.
It was filed December 6th, but we do not whether or when it was served.  It
alleges violations of the PUC, unfair and deceptive practices, false
advertising and fraudulent concealment against ACN Energy et. al arising
from their retail sales of electricity.  In essence, plaintiffs allege in
Rojoin that they were offered electricity at 3.4 cents per KWH when in fact
the true charges to plaintiffs turned out to be about 15 cents per KWH.  One
of the allegations is that plaintiffs were not told of the "sneaky way that
the fees are recalculated."
 In short, the Rojoin complaint as written does not really address
the wholesale market other than to allege that ACN is acting to take
advantage of the "deregulated" electricity market.
 Counsel for one of the other defendants, Chris Healy, has commented
that they have concerns that this case may be the weakest in terms of
removal under a federal question.  If the defendants try to remove that case
and lose it could be harmful or undermine the basis for removal in the other
cases.  As a practical matter, Jean Frizzel, Dave Noonan, Mike Kirby and I
tend to agree with him.  As you know, we are trying to find out who is
representing ACN to see what they are planning to do.
 Since the Rojoin allegations are aimed exclusively right now at the
residential market, we thought it important to bring you up to date.  Unless
EES has a similar fact pattern to that alleged in the complaint (e.g. energy
rates charged to customers as the higher of 3.4 cents per kwh or the
difference between 3 cents and the power exchange price without revealing
what the power exchange price might be), this may be a stand alone case
where it is unlikely that EES would be brought in.
 Mike Kirby and Dave Noonan are looking at the question of whether if
the Rojoin complaint is amended, new defendants would have the ability to
seek removal then.
 Bottom line - given the unique fact pattern of the Rojoin case and
subject to your confirmation that EES does not have a similar fact pattern,
it may make sense to just let the Rojoin case alone and not attempt to
influence counsel for the defense with respect to removal and focus our
efforts on the Berg, Continental Forge and Phillip cases.
 Do you concur?

Thanks
Gary

>provide more detailed comments in the near future.
>
>While the proposed order is not as clear and unambiguous as I would

>tariffs which were filed in December of 1995 is an important
>contribution to at least partially mitigating the exercise of market
>power as well as helping to establish the legal basis for what will
>surely prove to be a vigorous court fight.
>
>Your unambiguous declaration that the rates being charged in the
>wholesale market are, and have been, "unjust and unreasonable", would
>have restored credibility to the wholesale market. But your action is
>more than adequate for the California Public Utilities Commission to
>deny the applicability of the filed rate doctrine to the wholesale
>prices produced by a FERC-approved tariff, which FERC has now ruled
>failed to produce "just and reasonable" rates.
>
>For California consumers, it means that there is now a legal
>justification for these unjust wholesale costs to not be passed on to
>the retail ratepayers.  In turn, the State and consumers should
>support utilities in litigating for relief against those parties who
>profited from "unjust and unreasonable" wholesale rates which, of
>course, will likely require action against FERC itself.
>
>As I have indicated in prior correspondence, we disagree with your
>counsel's opinion that you are constrained from acting retroactively.
>If the tariffs produced "unjust and unreasonable rates" and were,
>therefore, illegal in October, they were similarly illegal in prior
>months in which the effect of market power was even more evident.
>
>However, we appreciate both your stated desire to act retroactively
>and your request to Congress to clarify this authority. While we would
>certainly prefer that Congress act on your request, we are also
>confident that the Federal Court will confirm our legal analysis.  In
>the interim, your invitation to California to suggest equitable
>remedies for earlier periods, is most welcome.  As a threshold matter,
>a statement by you of your intention to host a settlement conference
>in San Diego would be most useful in moving such a remedy forward.
>
>I support your present proposals to restructure the previously
>FERC-approved tariffs to address the ability of parties to exercise
>market power as far as they go.  However, I do have concerns that
>enhancing the ability of California utilities to make forward
>purchases will not mitigate market power.  Since forward contracts
>will be based upon sellers expectations regarding real- time markets
>and since real-time market prices will still be distorted by the
>exercise of market power, forward contract prices will themselves be
>distorted.
> 
>Finally, I will take particular satisfaction in the conversion of the

Sanders.  The retention bonuses were approved, and the court entered the 
stipulation turning over litigation to the participants committee.  I was 
able to successfully withdraw our opposition to the retention bonus.  As an 
aside, Joe Eisenberg never did sign the stipulation; he orally agreed to it 
at the hearing.

One note - The court stepped back from its earlier statement that 
participant's are creditors of the estate like any other.  Judge Smith said 
her earlier statement was re a specific issue, and that participants might 
not be treated like ordinary creditors for all purposes, she hadn't fully 
considered that issue.  This was in response to the creditors committee 
argument that only the participants benefitted from the costs of the non-BR 
litigation, and trade creditors shouldn't bear those costs.  J. Smith didn't 
agree or disagree, but my reading of her comments is she was leaving that 
issue for another day, when the first fee app comes in.

Here's the significant details, sorry its lengthy but I wanted to be thorough:

1.  The Perot motion - the court granted the motion to reject the Perot 
contract; Perot withdrew its objection, as did the creditors committee, 
subject to the following additional terms:  Perot agreed to subordinate some 
of its claims to trade creditor's claims (not participant's).  This did not 
appear to affect Enron or participants much, if at all; Marc Cohen had agreed 
to this.

2.  Status report - nothing we didn't already know.  Next status report 
hearing is 11/15 at 10:30 am.

3.  Stipulation re Commandeering Litigation - SCE and Puget both withdrew 
their objections, as did the creditors committee.  This was approved, subject 
to the following (these aren't all going to be placed in an order - some were 
just comments agreed to by various parties ):

   a.  the participants committee agreed that its duty was to maximize 
recovery to the estate and participants (of course, we agree, or at least I 
thought we did)

   b.  the participants committee agreed that it will not take action 
(litigation) re the AIG bond for 30 days (I know there is significant 
activity going on to resolve this issue)

   c.  re potential conflicts of interest, no disposition of litigation is 
possible without approval of the court, after opportunity for objections 
(nothing more than is required by law anyway), and if an actual conflict 
arises, the committee will not pursue that litigation but instead defer to 
the CalPX estate;

   d.  the committe will provide copies of all pleadings to Puget;

   e.  re costs of such litigation, all fee applications are subject to court 
approval and objections, and according to the stipulation all costs will be 
paid first from any recoveries from this litigation

4.  Retention/Stay bonus - approved, subject to Sladoje taking only $425k 
(down from $492k), and Miller taking only 100% of base salary, down from 105%.

That was all.  Regards,  Dan

Please let me know ASAP over the weekend or Monday morning by 11:00 eastern 
of any final comments.  In order to file this on Monday (as I strongly 
recommend that we do), I must ask that you please limit your comments to 
truly substantive considerations.

Mary: Unfortunately, because of the additional text that others proposed, 
moving the Joskow and Kahn analysis to an Attachment and moving the cites to 
footnotes did not serve to shorten the document, which is now 9 pages.  
(However, both these changes should make the document more readible so I 
think they were still good suggestions.)  We could save about 2 pages if we 
convert the footnotes to endnotes, but I would be reluctant to do that since 
only truly motivated readers read endnotes.

A nice weekend to all.  Ron

Rusty,

Thank you very much for discussing the auction rules with Tim Belden, Tracy 
Ngo, and me earlier this afternoon.  As promised, I am attaching some 
proposed changes to the CTS rules.  I believe these changes will clarify the 
intent of CTS regarding settlement, collateral, and process.  I will be 
contacting you soon to walk through these changes.  I have included a 
red-lined version of the changes and a clean version without red-lining.

My number at EPMI is (503) 464-7795.  If you need to reach me this weekend, 
my home number is (503) 288-2499.

Thanks.

Steve

Richard,
    I am not sure what prompted this email today but here it is.  You will
note that Harvey did reinterpret the 1999 request slightly from whether we
would go back that far to how long it would take.  I wonder if the newspaper
articles had anything to do with it.....

Thanks
Gary

Gentlemen:
This will confirm our tentative agreement to your e-mail subject to our
right to follow-up (under the subpoenas already issued) to the extent that
the Enron Entities' responses on Oct. 13, 2000 and Oct. 27, 2000 are not
sufficient. For example, per your request, we will review the electronic
data base you provide us on the various transactions before we decide
whether we will insist on the confidential financial records addressing any
of the Enron Entities' profits or losses in the purchase and sale of
electricity in the WSCC. You also stated that we would receive the
electronic data base for 2000 on Oct.27, 2000 and that you will check with
your clients as to how soon you can get us the data for the transactions
from June through December, 1999.

 This will further confirm that your response to the subpoenas on behalf of
the Enron Entities, includes Enron Energy Marketing Corporation (EEMC), as
your Oct. 13, 2000 cover letter states. Therefore, as Mike Day orally agreed
in today's telephone conversation, there is no need for the Commission to
reissue or serve a new subpoena on EEMC.

Importance: High


Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

                Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

        Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of

the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

        Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy

Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

        Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the

burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars

of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
"family trees" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for

earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first

wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

        The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will

identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

        The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
"Transaction Documents") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which

information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings

regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

        For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell

generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,

do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to

produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

         For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one

half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  Nevertheless, Portland
General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction Documents
in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities,
to the extent relevant as discussed below.  We propose that the Commission
defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the
information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy
into the California market.  At that time a more accurate assessment can be
made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited
impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market.


TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

        We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for

the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.

EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the

Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

        The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


        Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

        We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

        We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know

if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Here are the results of our research regarding diversity.  It appears that
Sempra is a California corporation and therefore we do not have a basis to
remove this case to federal court on grounds of diversity.

Thanks.

Here is a summary of recent developments:

Another Class Action Natural Gas Complaint Against El Paso and others (Los
Angeles)
 Berg v. Southern California Gas Company. Class action anti-trust and
unfair competition.   This is a conspiracy case alleging that the Southern
California Gas, SDGE and El Paso  conspired not to compete in the
delivery of natural gas in Southern California.  The  complaint alleges
that the conspiracy resulted in discouraging new power plants and drove
up the cost of electricity by controlling the supply of gas.
 <<Berg Gas Complaint.pdf>>
Copy of Rojoin Electricity Complaint
 I do not believe I include a copy of this complaint before.  It is a
class action involving the retail electrical market.
 <<Rojoin.cmplt.PDF>>
California AG Investigation
 Here is a copy of my email to the California AG describing our
agreement re preservation of data:
Rich,
 As promised, here is my summary outline of what we discussed
regarding preservation of data:

1. In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the
topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete
any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that is personal and does
not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept, discarded
etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a backup made that will
capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After 24 hours, each
employee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to the
business needs (e.g. keep, discard).  From our conversation, I understand
that you agree that this is an acceptable procedure.

2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would
like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to
discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest
Drive Image Pro 4.0.  In addition, there may be some other individuals that
you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to copy
files from their hard drives onto the network.  Until we figure out which
computers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.  We discussed that
because of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this started
until after the new year.

3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along
business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of your
request.  We propose not to backup any other business units or functions.
On a going forward basis, those business functions that related to the
subject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete business
email.

4. We believe that relevant database  backups have been and will
continue to be made and preserved.

5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it
is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the network
(where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files to make
sufficient work space for the employee to work.

6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do
not have as detailed information immediately available.

As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being made
are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron entities may
have to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction, relevance,
privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically reserves each and
every right and objection it or its employees may have.

Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is
different than the above.
CPUC Subpoena
 Jeff Richter and Tim Belden have been working on getting the EPMI
data correctly gathered.  They hope that by the middle of next week the
Enron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and have
assembled it for production.  Because Jeff Richter will be gone until after
the New Year, we will not be producing any data to the CPUC until early next
year.
 Jeff and Tim are focused on having a common set of reliable data
that will be used for all subpoenas, discovery requests etc.  We also
discussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts to
help with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records for
which we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time.  In other
words, since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in Portland any
analytical work that Tim or Jeff do for us will be recorded on the backup
tapes.
Tim Belden
 FYI Tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due date
of December 25th.  He will become out of pocket for a short time thereafter.
FERC Reporting
 A question arose regarding whether Enron needed to file a report to
FERC concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps.  This was a
requirement that was requested by the ISO in an emergency application on
December 8th.  The order granting the relief did not seem to include the
reporting requirement.  The first cut at the data for the report showed that
Enron made $1.0M over a weekend by buying power at $500 and selling at $700.
A later cut at the data came up with a different answer.  When consulted by
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall, I made the unilateral decision not to file
the report.  It was unclear whether we needed to do so and I had not seen
and did not trust the data.  Later Dan Watkiss confirmed that he believed we
did not need to file the report.  However, beginning January 12th this
report will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap.  Since this report
requires a breakdown of costs vs. sales price, it is the same data that the
PUC has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in the
litigation.  Tim Belden and Jeff Richter are working on a standard reporting
method.
Hiring of Chief Operating Officer for ISO
 Tim Belden has been approached by the current Chief Operating
officer of the ISO requesting a job.  Apparently the COO and the current ISO
board are not getting along.  The issue raised by Tim to Mark Haedicke and
Richard was whether they saw a problem with this hire.  One of the key
issues would be what was the business purpose for the hire.  Obviously,
Enron does not want confidential ISO information from this person.  Also, if
this person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if his
testimony would be favorable to Enron it would be viewed as purchased.  On
the other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he was
employed by Enron that could be harmful.  There is also the question raised
whether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motives
could be in play.  Tim will be meeting with the COO on Friday.  He has
instructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data and
that no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation team.
Potential for Criminal Investigation
 The news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raised
questions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk of
personal liability for them (civil or criminal).  I reported that all we
know is that there is an investigation under way by the California Attorney
General.  We have no reason to believe right now that they are focused on
Enron or that Enron or any employee is a target.  I said that at this stage
of the investigation (including our investigation) we do not know enough
facts to evaluate the risk for individual employees.  We have not reviewed
the trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes.  If we learn of
facts that are specific to an employee, Mark has asked that we notify him
immediately.  We did provide some of this same information to traders we
interviewed early in the process.
Analysis of EPMI data
 I have taken a look at the deviation of the ISO energy flow on a
daily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations to
EPMI's.  The source of the data is public information that was available to
decision makers at the time.  The comparison shows that generally speaking
the ISO was short in its projection by a magnitude of 5-10 times the amount
that EPMI was out of balance.  There are some exceptions, but those are
rare.
Approaching Federal Judge for More Time
 Dave Noonan has pointed out that we should look carefully at the
assigned federal judge and decide who from the defense group locally in San
Diego would be in the best position to make the motion.
Holiday Contact List
 Dave Noonan suggested and I concurred that it makes sense for all of
you who receive this report to email me with your contact information and
schedule over the holiday period.  I will have a composite list made up and
distributed.

Thanks
Gary

Power-company profits climb along with prices=20
=20
=20
 By Craig D. Rose=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
October 18, 2000=20

A power company executive yesterday boiled California's ongoing electricity=
=20
crisis down to the bottom line.=20

"Prices are rising, and I know that's hurting consumers =01) but it certain=
ly=20
has been beneficial for Enron," said Jeffrey Skilling,=20
president and chief operating officer of the Houston-based energy and tradi=
ng=20
company.  Enron declined to specify how=20
much it earned from California during the past summer, when the state's=20
deregulated electricity market sent power prices=20
soaring. But the Texas company did say that profits of its sales and servic=
es=20
unit =01) which trades California electricity and o
ther commodities =01) increased 135 percent to $404 million.=20

Dynegy Inc., also based in Houston, reported that income from its marketing=
=20
and trade unit soared more than 300 percent to $142 million.   Steve
Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, said California was perhaps only the=20
third-biggest contributor to that surge. But industry analysts said the=20
earnings
 reports are the first indication of a pattern expected in coming weeks.=20

"California clearly drove the positive momentum at both of these companies,=
"=20
said Carol Coale, senior analyst of Prudential=20
Securities. "And you probably just saw the beginning of a string of strong=
=20
reports (from the power industry)."  She and others=20
say they suspect that power companies derived billions in profits from the=
=20
state, where tight supplies set the stage for huge price increases.=20

Companies did not necessarily have to own generating plants to profit from=
=20
the deregulated market. Enron produces no electricity in California=20
but is the nation's largest electricity trader, buying and selling the outp=
ut=20
of power plants owned by other companies.=20

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, said the big profits should be seen in=20
something other than a business context.  "These massive profits=20
by the energy companies translate directly into thousands of San Diegans=20
losing savings that were planned for education, mortgage=20
payments, health care and other . . . necessities," Hunter said.=20

When the state power exchange saw dramatic price increases within a matter =
of=20
hours, "it was clear that predatory pricing was producing=20
massive profits for someone," Hunter said.  Hunter insists that recent powe=
r=20
prices violate federal law mandating that rates be "just and reasonable."=
=20
He is calling for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order refunds=
.=20
FERC is scheduled to issue a report on the California market by Nov. 1.=20

The political fallout from the price increases, meanwhile, appears to weigh=
=20
heavily on power companies, which are reluctant to tout successes in=20
California for fear of being singled out for profiteering.=20

After noting that Dynegy's recent acquisitions in Illinois contributed=20
strongly to the company's success last quarter, Bergstrom was reminded that=
=20
he=20
had omitted mention of California.=20

"Illinois is not as politically volatile as California," Bergstrom said.=20

He acknowledged that Dynegy did "pretty well" in California because its pow=
er=20
plants produced far more electricity this year than last. Bergstrom=20
also sought to correct an earlier report that Dynegy had quickly recouped t=
he=20
cost of power plants it recently acquired in the state.=20

He said that was true only of the plants it owns in Long Beach and El=20
Segundo, which it bought in 1998. Bergstrom said the cost of Dynegy's half=
=20
interest=20
in the former San Diego Gas & Electric Encina power plant in Carlsbad =01)=
=20
acquired at the end of 1998 =01) had not been recovered.=20

Typically, plant operators assume that it will take as long as 20 years to=
=20
recoup such costs.=20

In comments to financial analysts, Skilling, of Enron, suggested that power=
=20
companies could help provide a solution to California's power problems.=20

"Supply constraints and the resulting price pressures in California and oth=
er=20
locations have demonstrated the need for skilled marketers like Enron=20
to provide reliable power and stable prices," Skilling said.  He predicted=
=20
that California's utility companies =01) which now buy much of their power =
from=20
other companies =01) would sign long-term contracts to stabilize prices,=20
following an approach suggested by many power generators and traders.=20

"If they were willing to extend the terms of their purchases to 10-year=20
contracts, then they could get contracts for $50 a megawatt, which is not=
=20
much=20
different than they were paying two or three years ago," Skilling said.=20

But consumer advocates have noted that long-term contracts at those levels=
=20
would lock consumers into price increases and leave them with little=20
choice about suppliers. Advocates of electrical deregulation had predicted=
=20
that introducing competition would lead to reductions in power costs=20
and to greater consumer choice.=20

Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said he=
=20
was skeptical of solutions proposed by the power industry.=20

"Any proposal from the industry has to be suspect because they have engaged=
=20
in faking out the California public and price gouging when there=20
are shortages," said Snyder, who advocates an end to deregulation.=20

"They do not have consumer interests at heart."

As promised, attached is a further draft reflecting our conversation this
afternoon.  The significant changes are in paragraph 3.   I may not have
included all of the persons to whom this email should have been addressed
(my list group email addresses is running out of room for email addresses),
so please forward this email to anyone at your company who should have this
that I have neglected.  And . . . convey my apologies.

I have advised Larry Drivon that he will have a draft midday tomorrow.  I
told him that I can "walk" him through the draft tomorrow afternoon if he
wants (but that I am NOT authorized to "negotiate" the provisions), that we
should schedule a call for early next week to address areas of disagreement,
and that we should address how we get an order before a court.  I told him
that that means that he probably will have to delay the ISO compliance
somewhat farther, but that we can take this a step at a time.

My secretary will circulate call in instructions tomorrow morning for our 11
a.m. EDT call (8 a.m. PDT).

High-level meetings took place between officials of the Clinto 
Administration, Governor Davis and other parties on Tuesday night (Ken Lay 
and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron). The parties agreed to continue the CA 
talks at Treasury and to suspend the FERC process.  The FERC chief judge and 
FERC staff attended the meetings at Treasury on Wednesday.  The Tuesday 
meeting is called the meeting of "principals."

Apparent   Process
Tuesday meeting gave two assignments to us.  
 (1)  Develop framework for auction for long-term contracts and resolving QF 
issues
 (2)  Develop framework for dealing with utility debt, including supplier 
"forbearance"

Long-term contracts--Attended by Sue Mara
 -- After much debate, divided into three subgroups:
  (a) Timeline/Implementation
  (b) Utility Needs/Product definition/RFP development
  (c) Standard Contract Development
 -- Timeline -- I was the lead and we completed our assignment.  We agreed on 
an aggressive schedule   with power flowing by 2/1/01.  The process is set up 
for DWR, working with a consultant.  It's an   RFP rather than an auction 
process. The idea of a  mock auction was rejected.
 --  Product definition -- Much work needed here.  Major issue set forth 
below.
 -- Contract -- Most parties (including Enron) want to use the EEI standard 
contract.  Group working on   additional provisions.  Plan final contract by 
Friday.
Utility Debt -- Attended by Sarah Novosel
 -- Report later

Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

NEW MAJOR ISSUE:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the 
State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had 
been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a forecast 
and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the 
utilities.  They were unwilling to commit to any time frame.
Kind of Auction or RFP -- a.k.a What does the Governor really want?  Many 
people in the room believe that the Governor was firm in his demand for 5.5 
cent power for ALL the unmet load of the utilities.  We spent four hours 
debating these issues.  In the end, the parties felt that the best approach 
would be to have simulataneous auctions as follows:
 -- Separate bids for NP 15 and SP 15
 -- RFP 1 -- Suppliers submit bids for more than one product with a blended 
price of 5.5 cents.
 -- RFP 2 -- (Considered closest to the Gov's proposal) State sets price of 
5.5 cents and suppliers compete    on term and volume.
 --RFP3 -- Suppliers provide bids for any of the utilities' product needs and 
are free to bid any price,    volume or term.
 -- All RFPs would be conducted simultaneously.  Parties agree that RFP3 is 
most likely to get the
   greatest number of bids.
  
Next Steps
Meetings continue on Thursday
Plan is to have final documents ready for the next meeting of the principals
Principals tentatively set to meet on Friday or Saturday.

As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a 
protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened 
from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this on 
our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.

They request that we be required:
to answer their motion on Thursday,
to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering 
production, and
to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, 
specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price.

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its 
proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose 
their requests for:
the information to be provided for "government eyes only" -  this would 
prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants.
a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to "share" this 
information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant 
to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make 
information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state 
regulation of public utilities.  We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not 
apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate 
how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market 
power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it 
should have this information.)  
the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the 
competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the 
Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's "unfettered access" to the forwards 
market.  This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get 
information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall 
Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

The most recent information from the CAISO shows our credit at $32,033,420.19.  This amount if for the period of January 1, 2001 through April 6, 2001.  The CAISO settlement folks will not break out PG&E's share of this amount because of  incomplete data (the PX has necessary information from Jan-Feb 2001), (2) the numbers keep changing as the CAISO continues to run refunds, and (3) they claim that CAISO "legal" won't let them release information on PG&E's share.  This morning I put in a call to a CAISO attorney, Beth Ann Burns, to lodge a formal request for data pursuant to CAISO Tariff section 11.20.2 showing PG&E's share of our underscheduling penalty revenues.  She is looking into this. 

I have also asked Kit Blair in settlements to request an updated number showing revenues, if any, from April 6 through July.

I will keep you advised of any developments.

Steve

First, let me congratulate you on your terriffic quarter of earnings growth,
up 31% over the same period last year . Absolutely spectacular. Your
shareholders must be quite happy with that type of performance. Your company
executives should be proud. 

I live in Spring Valley, California. I paid $357 for my electricity for the
months of July, August and September. Not only that, I might be on the hook
for untold thousands of dollars when the current electric legislation
expires in 2002. I know that Enron is a member of the California Power
Exchange.  You cannot sit there and tell me that you did not benefit from
the exploding energy prices caused by "DEREGULATION". And, I'm also pretty
sure this is not the only email you have received commenting on the high
prices of energy.

I just wanted to congratulate you on the fine quarter. Keep sucking up those
profits... Like a vampire.

Mike Day has been in discussions with Harvey Morris this week about Enron's
responses.  According to Harvey, they are about to issue a second motion to
compel at FERC and if Enron does not want to get its name on that pleading,
we are being asked to give a date certain when we will have data available
for the PUC.  Today we submitted the EES/EEMC data which Harvey
acknowledged.  Harvey claims he is under extreme pressure to treat Enron as
being not cooperative.  We need to decide what to do with the Portland
General information as well.  I know that Dave Aamodt would like to produce
that information to the PUC if at all possible.  According to Mike Day, we
probably have a few days to respond before the PUC will move to compel.  By
then we would need to submit our formal objections and responses.

Thanks
Gary

 When we printed out the final hard copy of the memo for our files we 
discovered that it did not print correctly.  The memo heading masked the date 
and the privileged designation.  Although we realize that you have probably 
passed this on, we are providing a new version which we believe corrects the 
problem.  If you can we would ask that you use this version.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E), in filings with the California Public=20
Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator=20
(Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases=
=20
in the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate=20
cap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour.=20
In seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent=
=20
company of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN=
),=20
a ratepayer advocacy group.

ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale=
=20
market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San=20
Diego this summer. As San Diego Gas & Electric had paid off its stranded=20
costs, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers=20
were exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled=20
due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E=20
customers=20
were not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not=20
paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze.

Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same.=20
PG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul=
t=20
is about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7=
=20
billion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been=20
unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real=20
terms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale=20
market this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers=
=20
on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7=20
billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount=
=20
is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's=
=20
motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale=20
rates in California.

However, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as=
=20
other divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.=01*is still making money of=
f=20
deregulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear=20
plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa=
le=20
market. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities=
=01*
the=20
ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power=20
assets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit=
ion,=20
PG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing=
=20
very well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in=
=20
markets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and=20
New Hampshire=01*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarte=
r.=20
Thus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent,=
=20
PG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not=
=20
support rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other=
=20
states.

PG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in=20
revenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last=20
year. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts=20
PG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince=20
shareholders=20
that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that=
=20
it sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators=20
that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay=
=20
for power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come=20
anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due=20
to its obligation of serving customers.

PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest,=
=20
or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,=
=20
something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due=20
to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the=
=20
utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs=
=20
are already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E=
=20
will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt=20
it has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled=20
a hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these=20
proceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over=20
its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted=
.=20
PG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based=
=20
on the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its=20
stranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest.

It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed=
=20
the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN=20
and PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most=
=20
issues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want=20
to see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons.=20
TURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the=20
rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted=20
from that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the=20
proceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the=20
possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer=
s.

Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear=20
on PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates=20
have called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation=
=20
in California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E'=
s=20
proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California=20
to a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has=20
very clearly stated that its proposal is a "necessary short-term step to=20
try to bring prices back in line." PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe=
d=20
as a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merel=
y=20
attempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure=20
temporary=20
lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and=20
transfer=20
its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati=
on=20
via a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it=20
continues=20
to sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes=
=20
that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new=20
power plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo=
my=20
of the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in=20
California.=20
As we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for=20
power.=20

PG&E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anythi=
ng=20
else, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous=20
economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers. A=20
recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu=
e=20
to exceed what PG&E can charge customers, the utility could become=20

Jim -- the following are our concerns about PG&E's proposal/possible points 
to make in a response:

1. Enron would be one of the largest unsecured creditors in the event of a 
PG&E bankruptcy; our claim may become even larger  depending on the extent to 
which we acquire additional claims against the utilities through the PX or 
ISO.  We are therefore interested in any action that would reduce the pool of 
assets available to unsecured creditors.  
2. This proposal may be to our benefit, or to our detriment.  There is not a 
great deal of detail in the proposal currently on the table, and Enron needs 
additional information in order to evaluate the proposal.   Certainly, we 
need to evaluate this in light of other developments.  

3. The proposal contemplates pledging "existing and future" receivables to 
secure obligations owed to gas suppliers; PGE shows approx. $1.3 billion in 
A/R as of 9/30; will that (or an amount of like magnitude) be pledged as 
security under this plan?  Granting gas suppliers security may be fine with 
us, but we don't have a great interest in OVER-collateralizing their 
positions.  More current information on the current A/R balances and the 
extent to which obligations to suppliers will be secured will be helpful.

4. Do they intend to extend this security to ALL gas suppliers, or only those 
that are refusing to supply PGE under current circumstances?

5. Do they intend to secure obligations on a going-forward basis only, or 
will they also secure their obligations with respect to payables that have 
already accrued?

6. PG&E is scheduled to make a couple of large payments to ENE tomorrow; what 
is PG&E's ability to make those payments for gas already delivered?

7. Given the extension of the DOE order, it seems that consideration of this 
petition could be delayed for a few days to allow interested parties 
sufficient time to evaluate its implications.

Give me a call with any questions.

In light of the DOE extension of the emergency gas supply order, there should 
now be adequate time for PG&E  to respond to these points and clarify their 
proposal.

Tim,

Here is another question that you might face:

Q: How to you explain Enron continuing to charge unjust and
unreasonable prices?

A: I disagree with the premise of your question.  I am not here to
discuss the specifics pertaining to Enron.  However, in my view, Enron
responded appropriately to the complex market conditions that existed and
continue to exist.  The determination of what is just and reasonable under
the circumstances that is in the jurisdiction of FERC.  I do not have
available to me all the information that FERC has so I am not prepared to
comment further.  Based upon what the information I have, however, I believe
that the the payments received by Enron were just and reasonable under the
circumstances.

Thanks
Gary

Richard and Elizabeth:  
While I was away on vacation, Steve Hall included this statement in a status 
report to me;  

" >While you were gone I learned a new one from Smith Day, which involves 
submitting bids for less than one MW, i.e., .0005 MW.  Because of a glitch in 
the ISO's rounding system, the MW get rounded down, but the payment gets 
rounded up.  Playing this game is worth about $9000/day. "

9,000 X 365 = 3,250,000.

Let's discuss.  ----cgy

Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market 
transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their 
reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons:

Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was 
not artfully written.  Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information 
necessary for refunds.
We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more 
liquid.  As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals 
will not be achieved.
Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be 
achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell 
out-of-market without FERC scrutiny.

		 Subject: Burton Presentation and Press Conference

The following are summaries of today's appearance by Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
 
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at a lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would "love it to death," meaning it would 
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
 
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight by the PUC.  He 
said that will not be the case when it leaves the Senate.
 
Burton is obviously troubled by the MOU; he said "some people" say it doesn't 
just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.  He said the following 
would have to take place for the MOU to be acceptable:
 
Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% "haircut";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what 
the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay back debt.
 
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said "no" and that he feels 
the parent should pay "a ton."  That led to a discussion of the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like. He used the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.  A larger infusion of cash 
from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate 
component. 
 
Burton called the dedicated rate component a "big problem" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign.
 
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more (note:  
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk 
shows and other media).  He later threw out the number $200.  The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.  It's tough medicine, but as he put it, 
"You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy, but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK."
 
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how he believe the 
situation should be handled:  "The only way to deal with exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards."
 
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU, Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into December.
 
 
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
 
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit 
against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit.  A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.  If 
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
 
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City of 
Oakland.  At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty. Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz 
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.  
 
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling within 21 days.
 
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
 
Joe Cotchett said the suit is "very basic" and is based on the Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to "fair and justifiable" rates.  A 
primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a "health and welfare" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely affected by blackouts.  
He said it is "not an economic lawsuit -- it's about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities."  Today also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
 
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were opportunities to 
exert market power.  He also claimed that a Redondo Beach facility (obviously 
AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant off-line and 
substituting higher rates.  He said, however, that this order had been sealed.
 
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of blackouts this summer, 
which could mean four hours a day.  That could be, he said, "potentially the 
ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration."  Cotchett noted that only 
hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from blackouts, which does not 
protect surgical centers or many health facilities.
 
Jerry Brown added that "prices are unjust and people are suffering."  
Continued high prices could mean "potential civic disruption," and that there 
will be "more actions to mobilize" Western mayors.
 
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit.
 
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV here as a legal 
expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his Press 
Club appearance.  He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on 
to say that the state had no standing to file the suit. Burton's lawyer's 
sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team.
 
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market power for three 
years, and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably.  It has 
failed to define "fair and justifiable"; that failure, he said, violates the 
Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Constitution.
 
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon "fellow Republicans" 
to support the effort.
 
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she believed that if 
the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
 
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because 
"5 generators supply 90%" of the electricity in CA and all five have rate 
renewals before FERC.  He also said one of the cases that is relevant is Bush 
v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set standards 
(regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal Protection 
clause.  He also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have 
requested briefs:  Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Minnesota and one 
other he didn't name.  None of these states has yet committed to joining the 
suit.

Some news from the weekend:


UTILITIES/ENERGY: Calif. officials investigating Reliant Energy's 
 finances

 Los Angeles --- Reliant Energy is the subject of an investigation 
 by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer on allegations of price 
 gouging in the wholesale power market, Dow Jones News Service 
 reported, citing sources working on the investigation. Dow Jones 
 reported the attorney general is investigating how Reliant, a 
 generation company, was able to boost its third-quarter net profit by 
 25 percent to 30 percent above analysts' estimates compared with the 
 same period in 1999, according to the company's earnings statement. 
 The company has indicated that third-quarter earnings available for 
 equity will top last year's figure by about $110 million. Reliant 
 officials didn't comment on the matter.

No but we found out what they want.  They don't really want all the other 
stuff they asked for.  What they really want is our financial information 
(profit and loss).

Thanks, Mary.  Did the PUC accept our deal re: information from the subpoena?

Here's what those of us in San Francisco read Sunday morning, as the lead
story in the SF Chronicle:

>
> Power companies say it so often, and with such certainty, that it has
> become a virtual mantra: "Skyrocketing" energy use by Californians is a
> root cause of the state's power crisis, and justification for surging
> electricity prices.
> But a computer analysis of electricity usage data by The Chronicle reveals
> that the mantra is a myth -- that overall growth in electricity demand
> hasn't been nearly as great as the industry portrays it.
> The industry has painted the summer of 2000 as the equivalent of a
> 100-year storm in meteorology -- an event so powerful and unexpected that
> the existing infrastructure was devastated by its force.
> The statistics show that 2000, taken in total, was nothing of the sort.
> Moreover, two independent state agencies' assessments of California's
> power plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been
> easily accommodated.
> The companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power-
> generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and
> consequent plant usage necessitated major, time-consuming repairs.
> "The claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally
> unexpected and due to the Internet economy, to Silicon Valley, or server
> farms,
> or people recharging cell phones -- that's bogus," said Tom Kelly,
> assistant executive director of the California Energy Commission. "About
> as bogus as you can get."
> The Chronicle's findings are based on data collected by the California
> Independent System Operator, a manager of the state's electricity grid.
> They show:
> -- Total electricity consumption in California increased only 4.75 percent
> in 2000 from 1999, a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives,
> who have repeatedly relied on isolated, loose or selective comparisons
> that make growth appear as high as 20 percent. In fact, the single
> greatest hour of electricity usage in 2000 was actually lower than any
> peak demand period in 1999 or 1998.
> -- Average peak demand -- the average of the highest hour of electricity
> usage for each day -- increased only 4.79 percent from 1999 to 2000. Even
> during the months of May to September in 2000, when the greatest spikes in
> electricity usage occur, demand growth was only 8.31 percent higher than
> the same period the year before.
> -- More than 30 days of critical power shortage warnings, so-called Stage
> 3 emergencies, and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of
> moderate energy use -- levels often below those at which neither warnings
> nor blackouts have occurred in the past.
> The findings appear to buttress suspicions that the "skyrocketing demand"
> explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really
> happening --
> that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential
> commodity, regardless of whether it is in short supply.
> Presented with The Chronicle's findings, Gary Ackerman, a representative
> for the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group representing power
> companies, said the calculations support the industry position that
> electricity demand is growing strong.
> "That's pretty healthy growth for California as opposed to the long-term
> historical average, which is close to 2 percent," he said. "To me, that's
> really strong growth."
> Energy demand is certainly on the rise in California -- growth of more
> than 4 percent is still double what was projected -- and the state has
> obviously fallen behind in building power plants.
> Even though a recent study found California ranked 47th out of the 50
> states in per-capita energy consumption, the surging demand explanation
> has become so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel. Gov.
> Gray Davis has made energy conservation -- 10 percent, at that -- a
> centerpiece of his efforts to solve the crisis.
> "Energy use is growing," said state Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco,
> citing the growth of Silicon Valley and high-tech operations statewide.
> "There's been tremendous growth, whether manufacturing or high tech --
> cell phones, faxes, whatever. The stuff is growing."
> Yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the
> consumer is largely to blame. In testimony and submissions to government
> bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis, energy demand growth has
> consistently been overstated.
> Joe Bob Perkins, the chief operating officer of Houston-based Reliant
> Energy Inc., told the U.S. Senate in January that California's growing
> economy and high summer temperatures caused electricity use to "surge
> dramatically" -- a demand growth of 13 percent.
> Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said Perkins' testimony was
> based on estimates by the federal Energy Information Administration of
> monthly retail electricity sales.
> "We do stand by that," Wheatley said. "Unfortunately, it does not track
> with ISO data."
> The industry-backed Edison Electric Institute said in a report that
> electricity demand grew by anywhere from 5 percent to 21 percent during
> the spring of 2000, compared with the same period a year earlier.
> Russell Tucker, an economist for the institute, said the group's figures
> were derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand
> for each spring month of 1999 and 2000 and comparing them, finding the May
> peak rose 21 percent.
> Granted, the state Energy Commission uses the same model to determine
> whether California has enough plant capacity to meet demand. But the
> presentation makes it appear that overall demand, not just the absolute
> peak, is growing by 21 percent. When the peak of each day is averaged and
> compared from year to year, May's figure was much lower: 12.79 percent.
> Also, nowhere did Edison's report note that the peak hour of 2000, a load
> of 43,784 megawatts on Aug. 16, was actually lower than the peak hours of
> either of the previous two years -- 45,884 on July 12, 1999, or 44,406 on
> Sept.
> 1, 1998.
> The Chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last
> year grew more than June's 15.34 percent, though no blackouts occurred in
> that month. May and June were the only months when demand growth exceeded
> 10 percent, the analysis showed. Most months recorded 4 percent or 5
> percent, and some -- such as September -- were less than 3 percent.
> Two months, October and December, had demand levels lower than the year
> before -- 4.22 percent less for October, 1.46 percent lower for December.
> Mike Florio, a consumer lawyer and board member of the ISO, said that even
> growth of less than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000 would seem overstated,
> since 1999 was a relatively mild weather year and 2000 was a much hotter
> one. "You are quite right," Florio said. " 'Skyrocketing' demand is a
> myth."
> MARKET MANIPULATION?
> Consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that,
> rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand, market manipulation
> is behind the crisis.
> Generators and power marketers adamantly deny this, saying they have done
> everything they could to keep the lights on. They say they ran aging,
> decrepit plants at higher-than-normal levels last summer to accommodate
> what they described as unprecedented demand. They also say that, at great
> expense, they delayed much-needed maintenance in order to keep the power
> flowing.
> Their claims have received some support from the Federal Energy Regulatory
> Commission, which said in a report last month that it found no evidence
> power companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply. The
> report, however, was heavily qualified by the FERC, which said it did not
> investigate other forms of manipulation. Moreover, the agency acknowledged
> that the bulk of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power
> plants and questioning them over the telephone.
> The supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate, in part
> because supply data are confidential. Thus, the question of how blackouts
> could have occurred at such low levels of demand in January is hard to
> answer. What is clear is that, at times, during the crisis this year, as
> much as 12, 000 megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for
> use, mostly because of unplanned plant outages -- about four times the

> But others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding

> of fear of not being paid.
> What did go up, unquestionably, were wholesale electricity prices.

Thanks for the note Richard, as I indicated, I will be making a presentation
at a Board of Directors meeting out of town on Wed.  I will try to break
away to be on the call for a small portion of time, but I will not be able
to listen in on the entire call.  I will call you and Gary when the board
meeting breaks up by 2 or 3 California time to see what transpired.  Mike

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers    Sunday, May 
20, 2001 
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 


Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by 
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, 
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy 
industry workers. 

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also 
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are 
supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 

The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was 
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four 
times as much as a year ago. 

Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters 
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to 
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 

Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant 
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of 
constricting supply. 

But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were 
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed 
to the plants' deteriorating condition. 

"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the 
ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, 
he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game 
something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units 
up." 

Unusual phone calls 

Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. 
say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early 
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's 
headquarters in Houston. 

According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations 
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as 
many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room 
computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call 
to ramp the units back up. 

"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who 
only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear 
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market 
change." 

The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a 
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in 
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one 
of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 

"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading 
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl 
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that 
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to 
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 

Corporate denial 

Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to 
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have 
asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, 
decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 

While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as 
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the 
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 

"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California 
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an 
operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), 
they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within 
an hour." 

Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers 
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it 
first. 

The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but 
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used 
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the 
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid 
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one 
of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 

Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment 
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source 
familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to 
have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business 
practices laws. 

Invisible practice 

How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 

One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually 
invisible to regulators and grid operators. 

When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain 
amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an 
average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot 
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount of energy required. 

The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their 
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. 
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity 
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the output was back at the expected level. 

Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if 
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the 
price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 

The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of 
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more 
aggressive than others. 

"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they 
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go up. 

"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd 
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 
'Bring it down again.' " 

Rapid changes 

These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from 
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of 
the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which 
also reduced wear and tear. 

"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the 
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on 
the units." 

ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on 
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when 
companies were withholding power. 

But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in 
driving up energy prices. 

A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day 
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of 
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost 
among those companies. 

Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for 
more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their 
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity 
from all sources. 

Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state 
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. 
(278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 

Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 

Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 

accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an 
operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the 
result of legitimate equipment failures. 

Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of 
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so 
the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 

But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at 
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously 
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was 
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit 
offline because of the problem. 

Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to 
keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for 
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary 
maintenance. 

Ramping may be rampant 

Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source 
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs 
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling 
calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in 
Minneapolis, he said. 

Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo 
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 

In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the 
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 

One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple 
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price was not met. 

On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be 
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt 
hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 

"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of 
issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our 
comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have 
already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply 
cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I 
haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.

Friday, January 12, 2001

By the end of the day, the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold 
another meeting with the CEOs, Governor Davis and various other Government 
officials.  Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video 
conference was set up with two locations:  one at DOE in Washington and one 
in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.  It was tentatively set up 
for 2:30 pm CST.  I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve 
Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.

Long-Term Forward Contracts

Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.  It includes a 
draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products 
required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1.
Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, 
given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.


Debt and Forebearance

Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday.


QF Contract Reformation

Parties continued discussion
No information was available by COB Friday.

Major Issues

State interest in resolving
State willingness to raise retail rates
Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager
Willingness to "call off the dogs" for the suppliers and to release them from 
legal action
State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development
Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation


Next Steps

If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, 
this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the 
week of Jan 15.

If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, 
such as:
FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16.
RFO completion and release by Jan 18
Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 
2.
Preparation of contract between utilities and state (probably DWR)
Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this 
settlement

And more...

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,

 After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas on
options:

1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER
 Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order that
is being litigated by others.  If the protective order has not  changed,
then unilaterally postpone production until it is.  Pro: Better protection
and more time; Con: Even with a more stringent
 protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitled
to financial performance data.  Thus, this option does not fully
disclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later of
simply engaging in delaying tactics.  Under this option  we file our
formal objections as well.

2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS
 Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data for
electricity that was delivered.  Pro: PUC will get the data  anyway
either through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouging
litigation.  By turning over the data that will show  profits, PUC might
slow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business by
seeking to depose witnesses etc.  Con:  This would be waiving the
legitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery this
information through a  subpoena.  There is also a question of how
confidential this data would be given the current political agenda.  It
might also serve  to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enron
information and discovery.   This option would also provide confidential
proprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitive
advantage.

3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OF
DATA FROM ISO AND PX.
 We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISO
and PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give  only missing
data. PRO:  It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside of
California data and would sidestep for the
 moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.  Con:  Without Enron
cost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC
 would not be able to arrive at what they want -- a profit and loss
picture.  We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that  the
combination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they need
to calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.

4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE
 This option would simple omit the price data.  Pro:  It would not
reveal the profit and loss information.  Con:  It would not reveal the
profit and loss information.  In other words, the PUC is clear that this is
what they are after.  By giving them everything else, we
 would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit and
loss.  Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PX
data, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will be
quite large, but just not the cost or expense side.

5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA
 We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its position
for the following reasons:  (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is  not
entitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latest
email, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more  data (1999)
than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like the
transaction data they will come back and  ask for profit and loss
information that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) Commissioner
Wood's statement that the purpose  of this investigation is to get
money from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigation
by the AG into activities  of other market participants and the notice
that other governmental agencies are cooperating -- who are we producing
this  information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors public
disclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required to
do so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other market
participants are not involved in the process BPA etc.    PRO:  This
may be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of the
PUC to get this data.  Moreover, in the  current political
environment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.  It
also makes sense to see what FERC  will do with their published 11/1/00
report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formal
objections and sit back and  wait.

6. ME TOO
 Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the other
market participants.  We will not produce until the protective order  is
modified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.  PRO:  This
makes it look like all the market participants are  acting in concert
and really is no different than option 1 above.  Moreover, if you read
Reliant's responses, they appear ready to  turn over financial data if
the protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of their
offices today.)  Note that  Williams is adopting a strategy that says
the PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.  This may be
met with  strong opposition by the PUC given their California
constitutional contempt authority.

7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ
 Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why the
PUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits  before the
ALJ.  PRO:  The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.  It
has the least procedural risks of being  dismissed.  CON:  Reading
the tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that the
PUC has no jurisdiction.
 Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally granted
contempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike  Day) that
they need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.  They will also take
the view that the Superior Court has no  jurisdiction  to hear our
appeal.  Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable at
the Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of our
objections might be at the ALJ level.

8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA
 We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal Power
Act and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUC
issued its subpoena in part.  The dispute to be decided is whether the PUC
has the jurisdiction to seek the profit and  loss information from the
wholesale market.  The authority for this would be Mississippi Power & Light
v. Mississippi  487 US  354 (bright line between wholesale market regulated
by FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.
New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 1994)(federal question whether state
agency can inquire into business and financial data  in the wholesale
market but found no cognizable claim.)  PRO:  The federal forum may be more
even handed than the ALJ, but  the question is whether we can state a
cognizable claim.  There may be greater protections from disclosure of the
information as  well.  CON:  The PUC may continue on a parallel track unless
we are able to obtain injunctive relief.  The PUC might seek  discovery of
the same information in the Federal court proceeding.  We should assume that
this action will trigger the strongest  response from the PUC and/or the AG
in form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the same
information (e.g  unfair business practice suit, price gouging,
anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for traders
etc.  By taking  this position, we will clearly be conceding that if
FERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.

9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES
 It may make some sense to chart a different course for Portland
General, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from  those
entities.  PRO:  The information provided for these entities is not likely
to generate profit and loss information that would be  germane to the fight
we are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates for
example.)  For Portland General,  Dave Aamodt is out of the office and
not able to participate in any change of direction discussions.

Hope this is helpful.
Thanks
Gary

FYI.

In case you haven't seen it. According to MRW's analysis for IEP, Portland General sold the highest-price power to DWR in 1Q01. But at $318,071, PGE is 61 out of 74 in terms of total sales dollars.  The highest is Mirant at $706 million.  

Enron Power Marketing is #60 out of 74 in terms of prices charged, and #26 in terms of totals sales to DWR (about $45MM), according to the analysis.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Removal


I spoke to Chris Healy of Luce, Forward (S.D.]. His firm reps Reliant. Gray
Cary[S.D] reps Williams[Jeff Shohet]; Shepard Mullin [S.D.] reps NRG;
Pillsbury [S.D.] reps Dynergy[Doug Tribble]; Latham [S.D.] probably reps
Sempra [Mike Weaver]; Southern does not as yet have local counsel although
Troutman & Sanders [Atlanta] is in touch on pending issues. Unknown who reps
PG&E [probably MoFo] or Morgan Stanley but should know by tomorrow.

There is already an informal defense group in Gordon case. Healy will
inquire whether any conflicts or other reason not to include Hendricks
defendants. I told him I knew of no reason particularly with respect to
early issues such as removal etc.

Present unanimous sentiment in favor of removal. Told him that was our
current view.

There is apparently another case called Campbell v. SDG&E which only names
SDG&E defendants which in-house counsel has already removed to federal
court. They drew Judge Linda Quinn in state court [not great] and Judge Irma
Gonzalez in fed. ct [good draw].This was 1st case filed. We need to review
to see if similar and if so whether we wish to utilize for low number
purposes if we remove.

He said there were differing views re whether removal would stick. In state
court they rated judges as follows: 1. Amos; 2.Quinn; 3. Meyer. He promised
to get back to me re further coordination.

Dan and Randy:

Dynegy is interested in working with you in this effort.  After hearing
back from Wiliams, Duke and Mirant, perhaps we should all set up a meeting
to coordinatre our efforts with our FERC and legislative teams.  Please let

Subject:  Strategy for Transferring Class Actions to FERC


(Sorry, Joel, I forgot the attachment last go around.)  Joel, in the
attached talking points, Randy McManus and I set out a White House and
DOE/FERC strategy for causing FERC to weigh in with the U.S. District Court
before which are pending the class action suits against our clients.  The
point would be to have FERC (1) oppose the motions to remand to state court
and (2) support referral from the U.S. District Court to FERC, both on
grounds of either primary or exclusive jurisdiction under the Power Act.

We are trying to put togehter a group to advocate this strategy.
Presently, I am in contact with Williams, Duke and Mirant, in addition to
you and Randy (on behalf of Reliant).  Once this group starts coming
together, I will get back with you.  In the meantime, if you have any
suggestions for improving the strategy or for securing additonal proponents
of it, please share your ideas with me.  Thanks.

Richard,

 Per Gary's request, here is the status of Duke Energy v. Governor
Davis and ISO v. Reliant.

Duke v. State of California.

 According to a news article, on February 27, 2001, Duke Energy Corp.
suspended its lawsuit against Gray Davis and the State "after the California
Department of Water Resources agreed to buy power from Duke that was
formerly being provided under contracts with two financially trouble
utilities."

 Originally, Duke argued that Governor Davis exceeded his authority
under the Emergency Services Act when he commandeered Duke's long-term
contracts.

 The case is suspended until an April 30 hearing.  I am trying to
obtain a copy of any order and/or stipulation filed with the Court.

ISO v. Reliant, et al.

 I.  Brief Summary of Complaint

 In ISO v. Reliant, et al., ISO seeks a preliminary injunction to
require six Reliant entities, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading, four AES
entities, and Dynegy Power Corporation (collectively, "Defendants") to
provide generation in response to ISO's emergency dispatch instructions.

 ISO's sole allegation is that because Defendants submitted to the
ISO Tariff by participating in the ISO markets and by entering into
Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and Participating Generator Agreements,
Defendants cannot refuse to generate in response to an emergency dispatch
order.  This allegation is based upon section 5.6.1 of the Tariff.

 II.  Current Status of the Case -- February 23, 2001 Stipulation

On February 23, 2001, the parties entered a stipulation, which states, in
relevant part:

   The Reliant Defendants, Williams, and Dynegy
(collectively "Generator Defendants") will comply with emergency dispatch
orders of the California ISO under the terms of the ISO tariff without
regard to whether ISO allocates the cost of power produced in response to
such a dispatch order to a creditworthy Scheduling Coorindator until the
earlier of the following:

   (a) 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on March 19,
2001, or

   (b) two business days (but in no event less than 48
hours) after written notice to this Court and the parties by a Generator
Defendant that this stipulated obligation is terminated as to it.

   3. Notice of termination by a Generator Defendant of
its obligation under paragraph 2(b) shall not affect the stipulated
obligations or remaining Generator Defendants except that, on receipt of
such notice, each remaining Generator Defendant shall have the right to file
with the Court an election terminating its obligation. In the event of such
an election, the obligation of a terminating Generator Defendant to comply
with ISO dispatch orders imposed by paragraph 2 shall end 48 hours after
written notice to ISO of the election to terminate. Each terminating
Generator Defendant shall have the same right and status to participate in
any legal proceedings that follow the initial notice of termination,
including any appeal.

   4. The motions heard by this Court on February 16,
2001, including ISO's motion for preliminary injunction, Reliant's motion to
dismiss or stay pursuant to the FERC order, and DWR's motion to dismiss
Reliant's third party complaint, will be deemed submitted at 5:00 p.m. on
March 16, 2001, or at 5:00 p.m. on the day written notice of termination of
the obligation stipulated in paragraph 2 is filed with the Court, whichever
is earlier.

 III.  February 16th Hearing

 Below is a summary of the hearing held on February 16th in the
Reliant case, which I initially prepared on Saturday, February 17th.  I
apologize if you did not receive this earlier.

>  The hearing involved three motions:
>
>  (A) ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction
>  (B) Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or Stay
>  (C) DWR's Motion to Dismiss Third Party Complaint
>
>  Judge Damrell took each motion under submission and stated that he
> will issue an order on or before February 21, 2001 at 5:00 p.m.  He
> ordered the February 8, 2001 TRO to remain in effect until then.  Judge
> Damrell clarified that the TRO requires Defendants to respond to all ISO
> Emergency Dispatch Orders ("EDOs") regardless of the creditworthiness of
> the purchasers.  The Judge encouraged Defendants to stipulate that they
> would respond to ISO EDOs, and gave Defendants until February 20, 2001 to
> do so.  (It appears that only AES is willing to do so at this time).
>
Summary

>  ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Reliant's Motion to
> Dismiss/ Stay are linked in that they essentially relate to the same
> issue:  Are generators obligated to respond to EDOs despite having no
> assurances that they will be paid, i.e., assurances that a creditworthy
> purchaser will be buying the generation in response to the EDO?
>
>  A.  Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or to Stay
>
>  Reliant's motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay was based
> solely upon a February 14, 2001 FERC order conditionally adopting ISO's
> proposed Amendment 36.  This FERC Order (as I understand it from the
> arguments) allows ISO to waive the creditworthy requirement only with
> respect to PG&E and SCE scheduling of energy to meet their own load.
>
>  Parsing the Order, Reliant argued that the Order implicitly means
> that the creditworthy requirement is not waived with respect to all other
> purchases, including EDOs.  Because of the FERC Order, Reliant argued that
> ISO's complaint, which seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants to
> respond to EDOs without assurances of creditworthiness, should be
> dismissed.  Alternatively, Reliant argued that because the proceeding
> before FERC continues, the Court should stay this case pending the outcome
> by FERC.
>
>  ISO argued that according to the language of the FERC Order, FERC
> explicitly did not rule on the issue related to the application of the
> creditworthiness requirement to EDOs.  And, a stay is improper because due
> to energy crisis, ISO cannot wait for FERC to decide this issue.
>
>  Analysis:  Judge Damrell appeared very skeptical of Reliant's
> interpretation of the Order.  He asked, "If FERC intended that the
> creditworthy requirements apply to EDO, why didn't it address it head-on,
> especially because the importance of this issue was raised by Dynegy
> before FERC?"  He questioned Reliant about several sentences in the Order
> which suggest that FERC explicitly did not decide the issue.
>
>  Judge Damrell is unlikely to stay the proceedings.  He stated that
> the exigencies of the situation are such that he perhaps he should not
> wait for FERC to rule.  He made several comments about how long it takes
> FERC to act, and that the Federal Courts should step in times of crisis
> such as this.
>
>  B.  ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction
>
>  In support of its motion for a preliminary injunction to require
> Defendants to provide generation in response to EDOs, ISO argued as
> follows: (1) Defendants submitted to the ISO Tariff by participating in
> the ISO markets and by entering into Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and
> Participating Generator Agreements; (2) Section 5.6.1 of the Tariff
> obligates Defendants to respond to EDOs; (3) EDOs are essential to "keep
> the lights on;" and (4) because the decision to issue EDOs are made only
> in times of emergencies, the ISO does not look at who the purchaser is, is
> not required to by the Tariff, and should not be required to because of
> the current energy crisis.
>
>  Defendants argued that they need not respond to an EDO without
> assurances that they would be selling to a creditworthy purchaser because
> (1) the creditworthy requirement is an essential element of the Tariff;
> and (2) a 2/14/01 FERC Order held that the creditworthy requirement
> applies even EDOs.
>
>  Dynegy raised an additional argument -- ISO and DWR are using the
> EDO procedures to get a price below market and that there is no real
> threat that the lights will go out.  According to Dynegy, DWR can back
> real time purchases including EDOs, but instead DWR backs only purchases
> at a certain price below market.  If generators refuse, ISO issues an EDO,
> with no assurances that the generators will get paid, as a strong arm
> tactic to get this below market price.  Dynegy argued that the reality is
> that the lights will not go out because if generators do not abide by the
> EDOs, DWR has enough money to buy at market rate.  There would be no issue
> here if DWR would pay the just and reasonable rate for the electricity,
> rather than using EDO procedures to lower the rate.  And, DWR can go to
> FERC if it believes that the rate is unjust and unreasonable.
>
>  Analysis:  Judge Damrell certainly appeared to be leaning towards
> the ISO.  He expressed his views that this case involves a narrow issue --
> do the Defendants have an obligation to respond to EDO's without
> assurances that it will get paid in this time of crisis.  His questions
> and comments suggest that he believes that the amount of energy subject to
> the EDO's is small and necessary to avert rolling black-outs.  He
> questioned Mr. Detmer, manager of operation of ISO, who suggested that
> about 5% of purchases at peak are made through EDOs.
>
>  Judge Damrell was not very sympathetic towards Dynegy's argument,
> asking "Are you was saying that DWR, ISO and the State are the cause of
> the crisis?"  Several times, Judge Damrell stated that he thought the high
> wholesale prices caused the crisis.  According to Judge Damrell, "the
> simple fact is, you got rich, and the utilities went broke."  Also, as
> noted above, Judge Damrell does not believe that waiting for FERC to make
> decisions is the proper course in the current energy crisis because FERC
> does not act quickly enough.
>
>  C.  DWR's Motion to Dismiss 3rd Party Complaint

 Reliant brought a third party complaint against DWR, and DWR moved
to dismiss.  As framed by the Court, the key issue is:  does 11th Amendment
prohibit Reliant from joining DWR in the case?  Judge Damrell asked about
the 11th Amendment immunity argument, stating that the issue was not
thoroughly briefed.  The Judge asked the parties to file supplemental briefs
on the issue.

 I am obtaining a copy of these supplemental briefs and I will
summarize DWR's argument in a subsequent email.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Letter from PG&E Regarding Payment for November, 2 
000 Invoice


  ISO Market Participants:
  On January 31, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received
by fax a letter from Joseph C. Henri, Director of Utility Electric Portfolio
Management at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E). Mr. Henri stated that
PG&E was providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO
Tariff that "Uncontrollable Forces prevent PG&E from performing all of its
obligations under the ISO Tariff."  Mr. Henri's letter identified
"government regulations and market conditions" as "forces beyond PG&E's
reasonable control."  In addition, Mr. Henri stated that the temporary
electric rate increase ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission
on January 4, 2001 was "an amount far below that necessary to enable PG&E to
generate sufficient cash to pay its ongoing procurement bills."
  Mr. Henri continued by stating that "PG&E...lacks the funds
to pay in full its bill from the Independent System Operator for November
power purchases, due on February 1, 2001."   Further, Mr. Henri stated that
"because PG&E's inability to make full payment is due to Uncontrollable
Forces, the ISO Tariff precludes the Independent Service (sic.) Operator
from imposing any sanctions against PG&E."
  Mr. Henri concluded by stating that PG&E's efforts to secure
relief from these circumstances continue and that PG&E will inform the ISO
as soon as it is able to resume making full payment for its wholesale power
purchases.
  At present, the California ISO neither accepts nor rejects
the claims made in Mr. Henri's letter. The purpose of this market notice is
to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against
PG&E based on PG&E's failure to pay in full ISO invoices.

 SEMPRA ENERGY RESOURCES
  I spoke with Dave Smith, Associate General Counsel for
Sempra Energy Resources.  (877) 736-7721.  He told me that unfortunately
they own part of an electrical generation facility in Nevada with Reliant.
Apparently it is a partnership.  They sell power into the PX.  Thus, there
does not appear to be a basis for claim inappropriate joinder.
 PG&E Energy Trading
  I called Marie Fiala, one of the lead partners at Heller
working on the PG&E vs. CPUC case.  She was very helpful, but did not know
the answer about what this company did or where it was located.  She found
out that the person to call is Steve Herman, General Counsel for PG&E
National Energy Group located in Maryland.  (301) 280-6815.  Meanwhile,
Peter Meringolo found this information in the 10K reports:

  PG&E Energy Trading is a defined term consisting of  "PG&E
Energy Trading--Gas Corporation, PG&E Energy Trading--Power, L.P., and their
affiliates (collectively, PG&E Energy Trading or PG&E ET)."  These companies
are headquartered in Houston, TX.  See 10-K at p. 32.  They "purchase
electric power from PG&E Corporation affiliates and the wholesale market and
natural gas from producers, marketers, and other parties. PG&E ET then
schedules, transports, and resells these commodities, either to third
parties or to other PG&E Corporation affiliates."

  In Exhibit 21 to the 10-K, which lists the subsidiaries of
PG&E Corp., these two companies are described as follows:

  PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation, incorporated in
California, with an address in Houston, TX.  This company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of PG&E National Energy Group, Inc. (a Delaware Corp,
headquartered in San Francisco, CA).  According to the 10-K, "PG&E Energy
Trading - Gas Corporation purchases and resells energy commodities and
related financial instruments."

  PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P. is a Delaware limited
partnership, with an address in Bethesda, MD.  According to the 10-K, "this
limited partnership is engaged in electric power marketing and trading."
This company is owned as follows:

* 2% owned by PG&E Energy Trading - Power Holdings Corporation, a
California Corporation, with an address in Bethesda, MD.  (This Company is
100% owned by PG&E Generating Company (now PG&E Shareholdings, Inc.), a
California Corporation with a San Francisco address.)

* 98% owned by PG&E ET Investments Corporation, a Delaware Corporation
with an address in San Antonio, TX.  (This company is 100% owned by PG&E
Energy Trading - Power Holdings Corp.)
Election of Judges

 Judge Amos and Judge Meyer were both re-elected in 1996.  They are
both up for re-election in 2002.  While Judge Amos is a Democrat appointed
by Jerry Brown, Judge Meyer is a Republican.  There is some though that Amos
might not run again.  The judges generally run unopposed on non-partisan
tickets.

I am flying in on Southwest from Oakland.  I arrive at about 9:30 p.m.
(United is suffering a work stoppage.)

I will see you for breakfast at 7:00 a.m.

Thanks
Gary

Joe Eisenberg just floated a trial balloon with me.  Joe is at risk of losing 
the CFO and counsel, something I reported yesterday.  On top of that, the 
creditors committee is balking at spending a part of the approximately $20 
million of "unencumbered" cash to keep the doors open and generate numbers 
that only benefit participants.  Joe is thinking about a liquidating plan.  
He didn't have all the details, but he did mention several points.  Some 
amount would be set aside to pay the trade debt.  He used a $5 million 
number.  The total unsecured debt (not including participants' claims) could 
be as much as $20 million if rejection damages are included, so those 
creditors would stand to get around 25%.  The balance of the cash, after 
paying administrative costs, would go, directly or indirectly, for the 
benefit of participants.  The litigation and claims resolution would be under 
the control of the participants.  Some of the cash would pay for accounting 
work.  Other cash would pay for prosecution of litigation claims under the 
direction of a committee.  In the end, whatever cash remains together with 
any recoveries from litigation, would presumably be distributed to 
participants.  I assume the plan would designate some individual to supervise 
the wind up process.  The participants committee could remain in existence to 
supervise the process.  If we structured such a plan, we'd try to push it to 
confirmation quickly, assuming support from the creditors committee.  The 
option may be appointment of a trustee.  We should discuss our preference so 
that I can get back to Eisenberg promptly.

Here is the proposed NW template for data from FERC.  It poses huge problems
for Enron if left unchanged.  For example, it only allows data to be
submitted for sales not purchases.  Since many entities that we purchased
from were not at the hearing and will not be submitting data, we will have
no way to claim offsets.  We have an opportunity to comment on this template
before the court rules on it on 8/9.

Thanks

California Power Exchange May Lose Monopoly on Federal Ruling
11/4/0 11:56 (New York)

California Power Exchange May Lose Monopoly on Federal Ruling

     Pasadena, California, Nov. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The California
Power Exchange, the marketplace where the state's three investor-
owned utilities must buy electricity, is on the brink of losing
its monopoly following this summer's power-price surge.
     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this week proposed
eliminating a state rule that PG&E Corp., Edison International and
Sempra Energy purchase almost all their power through the
exchange, which cost California consumers more than $100 million
to create. FERC expects to issue a final order by year-end.
     Under the proposal, the utilities could buy electricity
through other exchanges or directly from providers such as Enron
Corp. and Dynegy Inc. FERC said the move would help fix
California's ``seriously flawed'' market, where supply shortages
forced utilities to cut power to some customers this summer.
     ``The role of the power exchange is going to shrink,'' said
Josh Rokach, an adviser to FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert. ``People
will rely more on bilateral contracts'' between utilities and
generators, he said.
     Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform
Network, a San Francisco-based consumer group, went further:
``It's quite possible that the exchange will wither away if we
follow everything FERC has ordered.''

                         Expansion

     Others aren't so sure. Though intended to serve only
California, the exchange now handles one-fourth of the power
delivered in the Western Systems Coordinating Council, whose
members supply 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts
of Mexico.
     Further expansion into areas such as Nevada, Arizona and
Alberta, Canada, will offer local electricity buyers and sellers
``a well-developed market operator ready for competition,''
exchange President George Sladoje said in a statement.
     California lawmakers established the nonprofit exchange in
1996, as part of the deregulation of the state's electricity
market.
     The utilities buy 80 percent to 90 percent of their
electricity on the exchange, based in Pasadena, California. The
three utilities together supply about 75 percent of the state's
power, with the rest coming from cooperatives and municipal
agencies.

                         Long-Term Contracts

     The exchange is a day-ahead market, where buyers and sellers
set prices for power to be delivered the next day. The California
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's grid,
sells electricity in the hourly market, which fills last-minute
needs.
     FERC wants to give the utilities the opportunity to lock in
prices for power through longer-term contracts known as forwards.
Arranging supplies in advance would reduce the amount of power
that utilities must buy during periods of peak consumption, when
prices can soar, FERC says.
     Though the exchange has operated a forwards market since July
1999, the utilities until recently were prohibited from using it.
Even now, they must receive approval from the California Public
Utilities Commission to enter such contracts, and the amount of
electricity they can buy is limited.
     By comparison, municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power can freely enter into long-term
contracts and don't pay the transaction fees charged by the
exchange.
     Even if PG&E, Edison and Sempra are allowed to obtain
supplies through alternative means, the exchange isn't likely to
go away, said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of Sacramento-
based Independent Energy Producers, a trade group that represents
about 50 power producers.
     ``There will continue to be a need for a place for people to
do day-ahead transactions,'' Smutny-Jones said.

                         Transparency

     The exchange's ability to compete would depend in part on
whether rivals such as Enron and Dynegy, which sell electricity
throughout the U.S., are required to list prices openly, exchange
spokesman Jesus Arredondo said.
     ``Those folks don't have transparency right now,'' he said.
``If there isn't a level playing field, we're going to be at a
disadvantage.''
     Yet transparency on the exchange hasn't kept prices low.
During this year's hottest months, as demand for air conditioning
soared, the prices utilities paid for electricity through the
exchange and the California ISO more than quadrupled from a year
earlier.
     Utilities weren't able to respond to the price jump by
cutting their purchases because they needed the power, noted Bob
Levin, senior vice president of planning at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, one of the exchanges hoping to attract
business from California's utilities.
     ``FERC's proposal is a good way to start improving the
market,'' Levin said.
     Not everyone thinks allowing companies to buy outside the
exchange is without risk. State Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat
from El Cajon who co-wrote the state's 1996 deregulation law,
worries that oil and gas companies, big users of electricity for
their refineries, might draw up supply agreements in secret and
keep consumers in the dark about the terms.

                        Monopoly's End

     He warned in an Oct. 3 letter to FERC Chairman James Hoecker
that eliminating the exchange in favor of bilateral contracts
``would be disastrous, particularly for small commercial and
residential consumers.''
     Keeping California power prices a secret would be difficult,
even without the exchange, some industry observers say.
     Publishing companies such as Platt's, the commodities
division of Standard & Poor's, Financial Times Energy, and
Bloomberg LP report energy prices from around the world.
     They would be expected to begin collecting more information
in California as well if the market requires it, said Mark Palmer,
vice president of communications for Houston-based Enron Corp.,
the world's largest trader of electricity.
     ``You'll probably see California price indexes,'' Palmer
said.
     Spokesmen for Rosemead, California-based Edison and San Diego-
based Sempra said their companies wouldn't comment on future of
the exchange or their power purchases until FERC issues a final
order. PG&E, based in San Francisco, is reviewing the agency's
report, a spokesman said.
     Whatever FERC's decision, the exchange's future ultimately
should be decided by the market, not the state, said Richard
Bilas, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission.
     ``If the exchange is operating efficiently, it will survive
on its own,'' he said. ``Not as a sanctioned monopoly.''

Grp Urges Re-Regulation In Wake Of FERC Calif Pwr Order

11/03/2000

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- State regulators and legislators should re-regulate 
deregulated power markets after federal regulators left California consumers 
in the lurch, Public Citizen said Friday. 
The Ralph Nader-founded activist group decried an order by the U.S. Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday, which found electricity rates in 
California were unjust and unreasonable, but failed to find legal reason to 
refund money to consumers.
FERC found that the "seriously flawed" state-mandated market structure was to 
blame, rather than deregulated power producers, for the sky-high power prices 
roiling the first-in-the-nation deregulated electricity market. 
"In short, FERC found that California consumers were robbed of billions of 
dollars - reportedly more than $5 billion. But the agency can't find the 
robber, and thus it can't protect the victims of the crime," said Charlie 
Higley, the group's energy research director. 
"FERC's inability to protect consumers from unlawful price gouging reveals 
that state electricity deregulation has created unregulated monopolies and 
cartels that are free to fleece consumers for billions without fear of 
retribution," Higley said. 
Public Citizen's reaction served to underscore concerns voiced by FERC 
regulators that the consumer backlash spurred by California's flawed market 
design will work against continuing efforts by federal and state policymakers 
to further deregulate U.S. electricity markets. 
Public Citizen also called for the U.S. Justice Department to launch an 
investigation "to determine who is responsible for the unlawful abuse of 
California ratepayers by greedy power suppliers." 
Power producers angrily reject such characterizations. They say market 
forces, environmental regulations, hot weather, depressed hydropower supplies 
and record-high natural gas prices are behind the state's electricity-supply 
and market-volatility woes.

FERC Leaves Calif Pwr Consumer Relief In Lap Of Congress

11/03/2000

(This article was originally published Thursday) 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of Congress representing the San Diego area 
expressed disappointment Thursday that federal regulators found they couldn't 
order refunds to power consumers hard by the state's high-flying power market.
The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday issued an order in 
response to chronic power-supply problems in California that have sent 
wholesale power prices soaring. 
While the order called for a sweeping restructuring of the market to lessen 
wholesale power price volatility, the commission found it lacked authority to 
refund money to consumers. 
"Clearly federal legislative action is necessary because FERC didn't take the 
authority I think it has," said Rep. Bob Filner, R-Calif. 
"All the consumers and utilities are still on the line (to absorb soaring 
power costs) because FERC couldn't find any culpability anywhere," Filner 
said. "FERC should have found some specific culpability here." 
Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who has made the power price shock an issue in 
his re-election campaign, criticized the commission for blaming the market 
structure dictated by state legislators, rather than power providers, for the 
soaring costs. 
"I've never known a federal agency to override a state legislature like 
that," Bilbray said, accusing FERC of shrugging its shoulders by recognizing 
that market abuses occurred, but blaming the state lawmakers for it. 
"FERC's pointing the fingers at the state and not the power companies," he 
said. 
The commission's conclusion will make it all the more difficult to prod 
Congress to provide relief for California consumers, said Bilbray, who like 
Filner has sponsored a windfall profits bill in Congress. 
Bilbray suggested that California Gov. Gray Davis should call back the state 
Legislature in emergency session to address the problem. If he doesn't, then 
Congress will need to step in, he said. 
Filner said he is drafting legislation based on FERC's conclusions to give 
FERC the authority to refund consumers the windfall profits of the state's 
deregulated power producers. 
The bill would allow FERC to provide refunds in cases like California's where 
the commission found rates to be unjust and unreasonable, but found no 
specific companies to blame for the situation, Filner said. 
FERC Chairman James Hoecker anticipated disappointment as the commission 
discussed its order Wednesday. 
"Those eagerly anticipating this order expected two things, a lynching and a 
transfer of large amounts of money," Hoecker said. "Round up the bad guys ... 
and order digorgement of all their ill-gotten gains." 
Hoecker noted that if he were a retiree on a fixed income or a small business 
owner in San Diego, "I'd want my money back." 
But, he said, it's "not as simple as all that." 
Instead, Hoecker put the onus on Congress to act legislatively if the 
commission is to respond for consumers. FERC's ability to order retroactive 
refunds "ultimately rests with Congress," he said.

State Utilities Left With Burden of Reclaiming Costs From Crisis Energy: 
Issue will remain unsettled until next year when a new agreement is reached 
and flaws in deregulation are fixed.

The $6-billion wrecking ball that is waiting to slam either California 
consumers or the utility industry is back in the control of state officials 
after a federal commission this week failed to even address the problem. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission declared Wednesday that California 
has defects in its deregulated electricity market and proposed sweeping 
changes, but declined to deal with one of the most serious problems.
The summer's electricity crisis forced the state's three investor-owned 
utilities to purchase wholesale electricity costing $6 billion more than what 
they could charge consumers under existing rates. 
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric now want consumers to 
pay the full cost of those purchases in the form of monthly surcharges over 
the next five years--a plan that would push into the distant future any hope 
that deregulation would bring relief to the high-cost California electricity 
market. 
But state officials and Wall Street experts doubt the industry has any 
realistic chance of collecting all $6 billion. Despite their confident public 
stand, the utilities will likely settle with consumers. 
"I'd say the chances of utilities being made whole is zero, and the chances 
of them eating all the undercollections is zero," said Steve Fetter, an 
analyst with debt raters Fitch of New York. Fetter is former chairman of the 
Michigan Public Service Commission. 
A high state official who asked not to be named said a majority of the Public 
Utilities Commission believes that utilities are not entitled to the $6 
billion under current law. "The commission has interpreted the law the same 
way five times in a row," the official said. "So if anything is to change, 
the legislature will have to write new law." 
And yet division within the PUC has been evident lately, adding to the 
confusion. Despite repeated PUC declarations that SCE and PG&E cannot raise 
rates under the current deregulation law, the utilities were encouraged when 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said on Oct. 17 that "the basic assumptions 
underlying AB 1890 are ripe for reconsideration." 
The electricity cost issue is a political hot potato that California 
politicians and regulators clearly hoped the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission would handle by declaring costs "unjust and unreasonable" and by 
ordering generators to give back profits. 
But FERC said it found no evidence of specific market abuses and that it 
lacked the legal authority to order refunds of federallysanctioned wholesale 
rates in the absence of market-power evidence. 
Early next year, after a new state Legislature is sworn in and Gov. Gray 
Davis appoints his third of five members on the state Public Utilities 
Commission, lawmakers, officials and stakeholders will have to hammer out an 
agreement, which will probably require a new law. Wall Street is already 
signaling its impatience. 
"Our position has been that it is an unsettled situation as far as utilities 
are concerned," said Richard Cortright, a director at Standard & Poor's 
debt-rating service that downgraded its outlook on California utility debt to 
negative last summer. 
Consumer groups on the one side are clamoring for the utilities and power 
companies to pony up for the costs of a failed experiment in a free market 
for electrons, while on the other side the utilities who want full 
restitution from customers for the electricity they dutifully delivered at 
going market rates. 
"What FERC effectively did was say to California: You guys have to choose 
between utilities and consumers," said Douglas Heller, consumer advocate at 
the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "It's up 
to Gov. Davis and the Legislature to do the right thing and stand up to these 
utility companies." 
FERC's proposed order "really passed the buck" and left the PUC with clear 
jurisdiction over the utilities' transition costs, said Bob Finkelstein, a 
lawyer with The Utility Reform Network. 
The San Francisco consumer group has proposed that the PUC require the 
utilities to use sharply increasing profits earned through deregulation, such 
as from the sale of power into the market, to pay off the cost of electricity 
that they have not been able to pass along to customers. 
Utilities will argue just as strenuously that to make them absorb the 
unexpected costs of a vital service is unfair and would impinge on needed 
investments in electric infrastructure. 
PG&E and SCE have each petitioned the state Public Utilities Commission for 
permission to begin collecting those billions of dollars by approving rate 
increases. In SCE's case, the proposed rate increase would be no more than 
10%, which would add about $5.50 to the typical monthly residential bill. 
Although wholesale electricity rates have risen dramatically, SCE and PG&E 
customers are still protected by a rate freeze until utilities pay off costs 
related to "stranded assets" such as nuclear, wind and other noneconomic 
assets, or until March 2002. 
San Diego Gas & Electric got out from under the rate freeze after paying off 
its stranded assets early in 1999, and began passing along wholesale 
electricity costs directly to customers. But the state legislature imposed a 
rate cap last summer after wholesale rates doubled and tripled, causing a 
political firestorm. 
Steve Baum, chief executive of SDG&E parent Sempra Energy, said Thursday that 
he was disappointed that the FERC did not open the way for refunds from the 
power generators. 
"This is going to make Wall Street less than happy," Baum said. "They say 
they have no basis for refunds but that door is not slammed shut."

USA: Calif. gov. scraps Asia trip to deal with power woes.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov 2 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis Thursday 
scrapped a planned trip to Asia this month to remain at home to cope with the 
state's increasingly troubled power market, officials said. 
"The Asia trip has been postponed. We do not have a date for rescheduling," 
spokeswoman Hilary McLean said.
Davis had been due to visit Singapore, Brunei, Beijing, Shanghai between Nov. 
11-18. Instead, he now intends to remain in California to tackle the energy 
problems head-on. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) this week said that a probe 
into California's newly deregulated electricity markets had shown that 
drastic changes were needed to prevent a repetition of this past summer's 
price spikes and near power blackouts. 
But the regulators, though declaring power prices charged this summer were 
not "just and reasonable," as required by law, said they did not have the 
legal authority to demand refunds from generators, some of whom have made 
huge profits selling power in the California market. 
McLean said that Davis "has been very focused on California's electricity 
problems, and wants to make sure that California's electricity supply is 
reliable and affordable." 
"The governor is going to be needed to here to continue to engage in this 
issue," she said, without providing any further detail.

Calif Legislators Urge FERC To Hold Nov Mtg In San Diego

11/02/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Seven federal legislators from California are 
urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hold its scheduled Nov. 9 
public hearing on California's electricity problems in San Diego, not 
Washington. 
At the hearing, FERC will announce proposed remedies based on a FERC report 
issued Wednesday that found California's electricity market seriously flawed.
The legislators said in a Nov. 1 letter to FERC chairman James Hoecker that 
FERC should hold its hearing in San Diego because that is where people 
affected by proposed remedies live. The letter was signed by Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer; and Reps. Bob Filner, Brian Bilbray, Ron 
Packard, Duncan Hunter, and Randy Cunningham. 
San Diego residents were the first in the nation to be charged deregulated 
rates, and many saw their bills double and triple this summer due to a spike 
in wholesale power prices. FERC held hearings in San Diego in August to 
determine why those prices were so high. 
The letter asked that a supplementary hearing be held in San Diego if the 
Washington hearing couldn't be moved. 
"Clearly, the electricity crisis has caused more than a ripple in San 
Diegans' lives - a tsunami is more like it. For that reason, your Commission 
should hear of the real impacts that your order would have on the people and 
institutions of San Diego," the letter said. 
Nobody at FERC could be reached for comment.

USA: Calif. Senator Boxer wants more help for power markets.
By Patrick Connole

11/02/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - California Sen. Barbara Boxer on Thursday said 
she was "distressed" that U.S. regulators did not provide immediate relief 
for her state's power consumers when they backed draft measures on Wednesday 
for fixing the troubled electricity system there. 
Democrat Boxer, in a letter to U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC) Chairman James Hoecker, urged the commission to take stronger actions 
before their draft order becomes final next month to aid consumers.
"It is imperative that FERC act promptly to address California's energy 
crisis," Boxer wrote to Hoecker. 
Boxer wants FERC to approve a regional price cap throughout the 14 Western 
states on electricity price rates, order utilities to provide refunds to 
California customers and convene the next FERC meeting on the issue in San 
Diego on Nov. 9 so that California consumers can weigh in on the matter. 
San Diego consumers were most impacted by a sharp price rise in California's 
wholesale power markets this summer, since under the state's deregulation 
plan they were forced to pay market rates without a safety net. 
FERC did not order refunds as part of its draft remedies announced on 
Wednesday, saying they legally did not have the power to do so. The Nov. 9 
meeting is scheduled at commission headquarters in Washington D.C. 
The commission approved measures on Wednesday to establish independent 
oversight boards for the California Independent System Operator and Power 
Exchange (PX). Both entities help balance power supplies for state utilities 
and act as auction houses for buying and selling last-minute power. 
Other measures would eliminate the need for the three largest California 
utilities - Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric and SoCal 
Edison - to have to sell power to, or buy power from the PX. 
San Diego Gas & Electric is a unit of Sempra Energy , SoCal Edison is a unit 
of Edison International and Pacific Gas is owned by PG&E Corp. . The three 
are based in the San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, 
respectively. 
Other changes backed by FERC would allow the three investor-owned utilities 
to manage risk by allowing long and intermediate-term power supply contracts 
and would temporarily modify market auction bid processes.

Surplus Power Sold at a Loss
--------------------

Electricity: Cool summer and effective conservation efforts result in exces=
s supplies. Industry officials say it's a routine move.

By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Caught with an excess of electricity as a result of cool weat=
her and heavy conservation, the state government sold power at a loss appro=
aching $14 million in the first 16 days of July.

The loss amounts to roughly 3.5% of the total amount the state spent on pow=
er during that period.

To keep power flowing to 27 million Californians, the state purchased 3.5 m=
illion megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, accord=
ing to the state Department of Water Resources. It sold off 177,000 surplus=
 megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per megawatt-hour. Department=
 of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details in respo=
nse to an inquiry by Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine).

The sales of surplus power "get to the issue of, do these people really kno=
w what they're doing? Are they really competent to be managing this to the =
lowest cost for the ratepayers?" Campbell said. "It reinforces to me that w=
e should get the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."

Industry officials, however, say it is routine for utilities and electricit=
y companies to at times find themselves with more electricity than their cu=
stomers need. They either sell the power at a loss, work out an exchange of=
 power or give it away.

"It's not all that uncommon for utilities to be buying one day and selling =
the next," said one Pacific Northwest trader who asked not to be identified=
 because his company does not permit him to talk to reporters. He said a ru=
le of thumb in the industry is to match supply to demand within 1% to 2%, a=
lthough "5% on a load like California isn't that much."

Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly utili=
ties committee, said he did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.

"Right now the summer is cool," he said. "If this had been a normal July, w=
e would have used all that power."

"The worm could have turned the other way."

Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said the state's crew=
 of 15 power purchasers found themselves selling a "very minimal" amount of=
 electricity in May. In June, more power was sold, but less than was sold i=
n July, he said. The department has not released those figures.

Department officials expect the sales to stop if temperatures heat up later=
 this week.

The water department was thrust into the role of buying 30% to 50% of the s=
tate's overall electricity in January after the state's major utilities bec=
ame so financially crippled by high wholesale electricity prices that energ=
y companies refused to sell to them.

The department has so far spent roughly $8 billion of taxpayer money purcha=
sing power that is sent to the customers of Pacific Gas & Electric, Souther=
n California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.

Hidalgo said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the st=
ate's electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a m=
egawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in =
July.

"If we were out scrambling for power right now," Hidalgo said, "the market =
would reflect that and adjust to it, and we would most likely be paying muc=
h more in overall purchases."

Campbell said he assumes the department sold its most expensive, marginal m=
egawatts of power. But Hidalgo said that is not necessarily so. The departm=
ent does not track what it paid for the power it sells, he said.

The department's statement to Campbell shows sales to 25 different companie=
s, including the federal Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles D=
epartment of Water and Power, and several private energy companies that bou=
ght power plants from California's utilities under the state's 1996 deregul=
ation scheme. Those firms include Dynegy Corp., Reliant Energy, Mirant Corp=

=09    Figures show state lost big on extra power  Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT =
Monday, July 23, 2001  BY JOHN WOOLFOLK   Mercury News    State figures sho=
w California may have lost about $14 million this month selling surplus ele=
ctricity for less than it cost.  The Mercury News disclosed last week that =
some power was being sold at a loss. But the new figures provide the first =
indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate =
effort to avoid blackouts -- and how cheaply some of that power was sold wh=
en it turned out not to be needed.  A Republican lawmaker said Monday the l=
oss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' energy policies are needlessly c=
osting consumers.  ``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Ca=
mpbell, R-Irvine, who requested details of the state's surplus power sales.=
 ``The government needs to get out of the power business before it costs Ca=
lifornians even more money.''  A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 mil=
lion figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average price=
s and that the actual loss probably is less.  ``It's a number I'm sure he l=
ikes very much, but it's definitely an estimated number, and it could be fa=
r lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water =
Resources.  Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher.  The sta=
te has spent $415 million on power so far this month.  State officials last=
 week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left Calif=
ornia holding more power than it needs. The revelation was a stunning turna=
round for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power, expectin=
g shortages this summer.  Price that was paid  The state bought 3.5 million=
 megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an average price of $118 per meg=
awatt-hour, according to a response Friday by the Department of Water Resou=
rces to Campbell's inquiry. The state has sold 178,000 surplus megawatt-hou=
rs in July at an average price of $37, the department said.  Based on those=
 average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus power, which it=
 sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost.  A more precise =
calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased power is acq=
uired at different times and prices and pooled as a ``portfolio.''  Purchas=
es included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour as wel=
l as cheaper spot-market buys.  State officials last week said they were se=
lling surplus at $15 to $30 a megawatt-hour, while some traders cited uncon=
firmed sales as low as $1.  Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent =
just 5 percent of California's July purchases, which totaled $415 million. =
The $6.5 million from sales will help lower the state's power bill, he said=
, adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity.  ``Despite t=
he fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying operation in =
the world is going to have to plan for these types of situations,'' Hidalgo=
 said. ``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal operating procedure for a=
ny utility.''  Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric=
 in Oregon, have said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss a=
nd describe it as a cost of doing business.  The suppliers buying the state=
's surplus electricity on the cheap include the big out-of-state energy com=
panies that the governor has called price-gouging ``snakes.'' Among them ar=
e Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso Power Services, Mirant, =
Reliant Energy and Williams Energy.  `Best bid' taken  Hidalgo said the sta=
te took the best offers it could find.  ``It's only reasonable to get the b=
est bid you can,'' he said.  Campbell said the $14 million loss is troublin=
g because ratepayers or taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a pr=
ivate utility could be forced to eat the expense if regulators determined i=
t was unreasonable.  State officials say what's more important is that the =
overall cost of power is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million=
 in May to $25 million this month, in part because the state has so much po=

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO has received a number of calls from Market Participants asking to
review the confidential attachments to the CA ISO/EOB's March 1 motion
requested recently from FERC pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act
(request attached).  Market Participants argue that they require access to
the attachments in order to respond to the FOIA request.  The March 1 motion
requested confidential treatment for the attachments "although the ISO and
the EOB do not believe that confidential treatment is required under the ISO
Tariff" because they were nonetheless "concerned that release of the
information contained in the appendices at this time could adversely affect
the ngotiations currently underway between the State of California and the
generators".  Since these concerns exist, the CA ISO cannot release the
confidential appendices.  Attached however are the cover sheets to each
table which describe in detail what is contained in each table.  This
information should assist Market Participants interested in the matter to
prepare any response they may wish to submit to FERC.  Again, Market
Participants should not rely on the CA ISO to make their arguments for them.

The Cal ISO, Williams, AES Corporation, Southern, and Reliant moved that the 
CPUC modify its protective order.  People are protesting the fact that they 
have to file their answers before resolution of multiple issues over the 
protective order.  Williams is threatening to file a motion to quash.  It 
says "to the extent the CPUC is conducting a valid investigation within 
jurisdictional bounds, Williams will cooperate."  Richard you may want to 
call their attorney Alex Goldberg to get the details, if you haven't already 
talked to him.  Sorry, I don't have his phone number any more.

Richard,
 I just got off the phone with Nancy Pickover, a Bracewell paralegal,
who obtained for us the CPUC filing with FERC.  She is sending the 500 page
document overnight to me and to you Richard.  I will get a copy to Mike Day.
She is faxing the 16 page pleading and one of the exhibits immediately.  In
essence AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern are the named
entities.  As soon as we have more I will let you know.

Thanks
Gary

today.  Afterwards, we tried to establish the time that the PX declared that 
PG&E and Edison were in default so that we could, if necessary at a later 
time, show that EPMI had terminated before that default.  Unfortunately, the 
PX would not come out and say that a default had occurred, and as the day 
wound down, employees at the PX became more and more taciturn.  Brett made 
all of his calls on recorded lines, but I asked him to summarize the 
conversations in writing.  I thought everyone would be interested in seeing 
this.

Good work, Brett.

Subject: Conversation w/PX re: Default on 2/1/01

Steve, per your request.

Holli Kreb's desk; Presched1: 13:40;   Spoke to David Dan (626.537.3555) @ 
CalPX.  Asked him: 1) if PG&E and SCE had made pmt yet, 2) If anyone had 
defaulted  3)  Has the PX declared a default at this time.  David answer to 
these questions was he hadn't heard of anything, but he isn't in a position 
to know about these events.  He suggested I call Clark Cheng (x3243).  
Immediately called Clark and left message asking these three questions, and 
requested he call me ASAP.  

Donald Robinson's desk; Presched1; approx. b/t 14:00 and 14:30.  Called Clark 
Cheng @ CalPX.  
Q:  Did PX rec. PG&E and SCE pmts?   A:  Can't tell right now.  Back office 
is currently aggregating all of the data and trying to determine PX' position.
Q:  Has there been a default yet?  A:  No.  Too soon to tell.  PX doen's want 
to arbitrarily make that call until they've had a chance to contact the 
participant(s) and confirm an intent to default.
Q:  Has PX declared a default?  A:  No.  PX hasn't determined if they're 
dealing with a default.  So, PX has not made any such claim or notice to that 
effect at this time.
Q:  Once PX has had time to look at the data and determine if there has been 
a default, how will that be communicated to the market participants?   A:  PX 
plans on notifying the market via email.  PX anticipates an email will not go 
out until Friday, 2/2/01.

Hope this helps.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Brett

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,
 I am following up on the electronic data from Tim.  Do we have any
more progress yet?

 I also met with Mike Day yesterday to discuss his views on strategy
for opposing the subpoena if it becomes necessary.  He added an important
fact.  He said that because the CPUC is a California constitutionally
created entity, they take the view that they need not go to Superior Court
for enforcement of their orders.  While Williams and others are claiming
that they should, Michael believes it much much more likely that the
procedural course will be for the ALJ to enter a decision and order which
the full Commission may but need not consider.  If the Commission does not
take up the ALJ's order, at that point, we would be left with seeking a writ
of mandate at the Court of Appeals level.  In other words, if the CPUC takes
that view, then there may be no de novo review anywhere outside of the CPUC.
This is because orders of the CPUC are only reviewable at the Court of
Appeals level.  Thus, there may be no need for the Commission to even bother
trying to find a favorable judge in San Diego since the commission already
has the contempt power.  In short, this wrinkle seems to make the ALJ
approach even less appealing than before.  Williams, however, is still
pressing apparently on the theory that the CPUC should go to Superior Court.

 Michael also had a suggestion for a back channel approach to the AG
that was raised on the governmental affairs side of the house that might be
useful to discuss next week.

Thanks
Gary

Many thanks, Christian - we will be in touch shortly.

>>> <Christian.Yoder@enron.com> 02/02/01 12:07PM >>>
Harry and Kristin (sp??) I am fedexing down documents related to the
indemnity agreement issue.  Here is a narrative background account .


When the CalPX opened its doors sometime in 1998, it offered what is
referred to as the "Day Ahead" and "Day Of" markets.  As the names imply,
these markets were basically daily spot markets.  The transactions were
done on very short terms of one day or less.  This market is what is
referred to in the indemnity discussion as the "Core Market."   Originally,
the PX did not ask any of the Market Participants to sign any indemnity
agreements with respect to the Core Market.

In the summer of 1999, the PX began offering another market called the
Block Forward Market.  This market was for terms of one month or longer and
deals could be done for forward, or future dates, for example, the market
participant could,  in the summer of 1999, agree to buy power for the month
of October in 2001.  When they began this market, the PX opened up a new
software system and related internal bureaucracy and called all of this the
California Trading Systems or "CTS."  That is why the BFM is called the
CTS.

 Because a forward market for terms of one month or longer involved more
financial risk, the non-profit  PX decided to protect the interests of all
participants by going out to the market and getting a big company to post a
Surety Bond to it.  See CTS Surety Bond.  The CTS Surety Bond basically
said that if the PX experienced default liability in its BFM, that the
Surety would pay the PX money to cover it.  Before the Surety would sign
the Bond, however, it required each of the BFM market participants (which
it was theoreticaly protecting since the PX is itself a neutral non-profit
organization) to sign an Indemnity Agreement.  The Indemnity Agreement
basically says that if the Surety has to pay anything to the PX related to
the market participant indemnifior's default, that the indemnifior will pay
the Surety to cover his part of the default.

When the PX came to us and asked us to sign the Indemnification Agreement
with respect to the CTS  Bond, we (at Enron Power Marketing (EPMI), got
them to go to Enron Corp. our parent company, and work something out under
and already existing Indemnity Agreement between Enron Corp. and AIG, the
Surety.  We never did sign the CTS Indemnity Agreement.  You will see
documentation showing that we were advised that we had otherwise satisfied
the PX on this point and did not need to sign the Indemnity Agreement.
NOTE:  In the bizarre world of PX misinformation, incompetency and rank
confusion, they seem to feel that we still need to sign the CTS Indemnity
Agreement!  See Richard Sanders on this point.  We should be very careful
about simply telling them that we have already apparently signed something
which they once told us put us on the hook for this indemnification
obligation.

With all of this CTS block forward market in place and going, the CalPX, in
the summer of 2000, became anxious about the Core Market, and came out with
another bond, this one called the Core Market Bond, and asked all Core
Market Participants to sign a Core Market related Indemnity Agreement.  We
argued and procrastinated and delayed and never did sign the Core Market
Bond.

When we get into arguing with the arbitrator about putting the cash from
our drawn down letters of credit into an escrow account, it will be easy to
get him confused about the two different markets and the two different
bonds and the two different indemnity agreements and what we did with both.
The essential point about this that merits careful handling is:  the PX
drew down letters of credit related to the CTS-BFM, and in doing so, said
they had no choice because we would not sign an indemnity agreement
(presumably related to the CTS market), when, in fact, they had already
told us we were on the hook for the CTS indemnity pursuant to a letter
which you will see in the package I am sending you.  Why would they do
this?

There are two possible reasons.  The first is that they do not know what
they did in the past.  The second one is that they know very well that we
are on the hook for the CTS indemnity and they are intending to talk about
the Core Market Indemnity Agreement.  How can they hold us hostage for the
Core Market indemnity agreement when we are talking about a CTS collateral
issue?  They probably do this because they see the two markets as being
related, insofar as collateral is concerned.  The tariff says a default in
one market is a cross default in the other market for the purposes of
collateral.   NOTE:  The facts and the previous discussions that Richard
Sanders had with them need to be studied very carefully before we put our
final argument together before the arbitrator.

Please give me a call if I can be of any further assistance.  ----cgy

Richard,
 I included a copy of the Berg anti-trust and unfair competition
complaint filed by Tom Girardi and others in Los Angeles.  Tom Girardi is
the single best plaintiff's lawyer in southern California.  You may recall
his results against PG&E, Lockheed etc. where recovered billions of dollars.
He is well funded and has really good lawyers that work for him. He is
reputed to have close associations with many state court judges in Los
Angeles.

 Both Dick Odom and Michael Molland have been opposite Tom Girardi
for other clients.  Dick represented Roberts & Stevens in a complicated
securities case Fightertown v. Roberts & Stevens  that was tried for 8
weeks.   Tom Girardi posted $320M as damages in the case.  He received a
verdict of $7.0M which was eliminated by Dick's motion for JNOV.  Dick is
one of the very few trial lawyers that have gone head to head with Tom in
significant trial and won.  Dick was recently retained in another case where
Tom Girardi is the plaintiff's lawyer.  Apparently, we knew somebody who
happened to be with Tom Girardi when he received Brobeck's appearance.  His
comment was something to the effect of "Oh shit. Not those bastards again."

 Not many defendants have the courage to take a case where Girardi is
the plaintiff's counsel to trial.  Very few of the companies that have taken
him to trial have won.

 Mike Molland has also had several cases opposite Tom Girardi where
Michael represented Browning Ferris Industries as its lead trial lawyer in
the mid 1990s in the serial litigation that arose from the waste disposal
crisis  in Los Angeles County during that time. Girardi's firm sued BFI in
those and other cases during that time.  Michael was able to get BFI
dismissed from all but one of those cases early in the process. The other
case was stayed.

 I know we did not discuss these capabilities when you and Jim were
in San Francisco --in large part, because we did not have the Berg complaint
in hand at the time.  If Enron is considering lining up local counsel in Los
Angeles in the event that it is brought into the Berg case, I hope that you
will consider Dick.

Thanks
Gary

		 Subject: Rate design for 3 cent Rate increase for PGE/SCE

2 proposed decisions were released last night by the California PUC - one by 
the Judge and one by Chairman Lynch.  

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law).  Each decision allocates a 
substantial portion of the subsidy to non-residential classes, although Lynch 
does this to a lesser extent
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers will be put in place; the 5th tier (300+% 
of baseline) gets a 35 cent per kwh rate
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.
In a vindictive outlash, Lynch decision requires federal facilities to pay 
market prices under new schedules to be developed by the utilities
Judge's decision seems to require surcharge to show up as a separate line 
item; Lynch's decision requires that it not be shown separately

Oral argument occurs Friday and final decision is expected to be voted out 
Monday, June 14.

Prepared in Anticipation of Litigation

Here is the list of counsel that attended today's conference call regarding
public events involving the California Power Exchange Corporation.  I
delayed publishing this list until 6:00 p.m. because I kept receiving emails
from interested parties.  I also received the following report from John
Stamper at O'Melveny & Myers who represents SEMPRA and San Diego Gas &
Electric.

John had a conversation with Bob Moore from Millbank representing the
California PX.  Bob apparently told John that invoices for the chargebacks
will be issued on Monday February 5th and will be due and payable by
Thursday February 8th or Friday February 9th.  John asked for February 9th
rather than the 8th.  John raised again the possibility of a standstill
agreement.  Bob Moore reported that the CalPX was amenable to a standstill
agreement if everybody agreed.  They are worried, however, about being sued
for failing to liquidate collateral as soon as they are able etc.  John
pointed out that the CalPX might be subject to claims from those entities
that had their letters of credit drawn down improperly.  Bob then reported
that the number one option that the  CalPX was considering was bankruptcy.
It seems to them to be the one forum where they can get all the parties.
They are also considering dissolution and invoking the ADR procedure
themselves.

We have scheduled a teleconference to discuss the FERC options for 11:00
a.m. PST on Monday February 5, 2001.  The call in number is 1-800-205-3434,
participant code: 653687

I have also received a request to schedule an alternative teleconference for
1:00 p.m. PST to consider non-FERC alternatives.  This would include
litigation alternatives.  We will distribute the dial in number and access
code for that call on Monday morning.

Proposed Agenda for 11:00 a.m. FERC Option Teleconference:

I. Current Status of any proposed filings.
 Note:  Phil Fantle, in-house counsel for Cargill-Alliant sent me a
copy of a filing they made  with FERC on January 29th.  I will send a
copy under separate email cover.
II. Discussion of specific relevant examples where CalPX has violated
the tariff with respect to  specific PX Participants.  The purpose of
gathering these examples is to be able to  demonstrate that CalPX is
acting arbitrarily and capriciously if that is case.  This could
include identification of specific instances of inconsistent treatment of PX
Participants or  inconsistent treatment of the same PX Participant.

 For example, Phil Fantle pointed out that the way he reads the
tariff, if you look at the  chargeback formula set forth in Schedule 2,
Section 5.3, the ratio for each PX Participant  appears to be a fixed number
that  does not vary after the default of another PX Participant.     In
Phil's example, if a defaulting participant has a 25% share of the gross
MWHs sold in the Core market, during the chargeback process only 75%
of the default is paid through  chargeback because there is no provision for
recalculating the chargeback formula.

III. Summary of best arguments of why CalPX application of charge-back is
inconsistent with  tariff.
IV. Impact of Governor Davis' "commandeering" of SCE block forward
contracts.

Here is another hefty ISO  filing that came in this week.  Please let Sue o=

I know if you believe we should intervene/protest.

Summary of ISO Amendment 34:

Filed: December 28

Effective Date: 1/1/01 (expedited treatment requested)

Protests Due: January 17? (need to confirm this)

Filing in a Nutshell: The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t=

clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi=

Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No. 27.=20
(According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended=

and set for hearing.  Settlement negotiations are ongoing.  (Is Enron a par=

Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO=
=20
Tariff.

Specific Proposed Changes

Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity

The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the=
=20
determination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to u=
se=20
transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances. =20
Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing=20
contracts.  This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th=
e=20
ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method.

New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO=01,s Proposed Transmission Methodo=
logy

The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates=
=20
based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating=
=20
TO.  Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they=
=20
are known as =01&license plate=018 rates.  Under Amendment No. 27, this met=
hodology=20
continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO.  Once that=
=20
occurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be=
=20
assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen=
ts=20
of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area.

The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula where=
in=20
new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst=
em=20
average embedded costs.  The goal is that after 10 years there will be only=
 1=20
high voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the curren=
t=20
method, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charge=
s,=20
PG&E and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately $3.2 million and=20
Vernon would be subsidized approximately $7 million.

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale
electricity to the California Power Exchange.
10. Defendant Dynegy, Inc. (hereinafter "Dynegy") is a Houston, Texas
based public corporation doing business in the state of California as Dynegy
Marketing and Trade. It is a generator and trader of wholesale electricity
which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and
the class, and is a WSCC member.  Dynegy operates two electricity generating
power plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the
California Power Exchange.
 11.  Defendant NRG Energy, Inc. (hereinafter "NRG") is a Minneapolis,
Minnesota based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as NRG, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which is ultimately
sold to California consumers, including plaintiff and the class.  In
partnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating
plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California
Power Exchange.
12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter "AES") is an Arlington,
Virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which
is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the
class, and a WSCC member.  AES Pacific Group operates four electricity
generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity
to the California Power Exchange.
13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public
corporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy
Marketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale
electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including
plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  Williams Energy Marketing and
Trading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern
California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power
Exchange.
14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter "Duke Energy") is a
Houston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state of
California as Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, a generator and trader
of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers,
including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates
four electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale
electricity to the California Power Exchange.
 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
SoCal Conference Call Highlights

SoCal Conference Call- The following comments are notes from the SoCal conference call for defaulted debt holders, held 1:30 p.m. PDT, 13 July 2001:

Ted Kravner, the SoCal spokesperson, indicated that there are "a lot of bills floating around.  There's not a lot for us to say at this point."  After such a long delay, he stated that, "We are encouraged to see real action at the legislative level."  Also, the company could not comment as to whether the plans made the utility creditworthy; "We are evaluating that with Senate and Assembly leaders."

The spokesperson stated that on Monday the company will make a regular interest payments on the 5 7/8 notes totaling less than $6 M.  The company will also make payments on its other notes; the total amount to be paid will be $27 to $28 M.

Yesterday the CPUC granted the company's motion on the QF fixed rate agreement with the gas cogen and renewable QFs.  The spokesperson stated that the PUC said SoCal can recover all costs associated with its payments to these QFs.


	Appalucia Management Questions to SoCal
	Q:  	Will SCE defer payment on the "quids" notes, which are backed by a trust that has bonds issued against it?
	A: 	Under the terms of the notes SoCal is allowed to defer payment for up to 20 quarters.

	Q:	Would the CPUC, after providing for the DWR to be reimbursed for purchasing power (through the California Procurement Adjustment, or CPA), leave enough revenue for SoCal to remain solvent?  This was based on reports in the press recently that the DWR had requested a 25% rate increase.  
	A:	These reports were "speculation" and were based on numbers that DWR had submitted several weeks ago.  SoCal stated that DWR must update these numbers; therefore, no formal CPUC decision on reimbursing SoCal vis-?-vis DWR can be made at this time.  SoCal indicated that these numbers would be updated "in a few weeks."

	Prudential Questions to SoCal
	Q: 	What bills are currently in process dealing with the MOU?
	A:	There is the Polanco bill, which is the original MOU; the 	Assembly (Hertzberg) bill AB 82XX, which uses the Polanco bill as its foundation; and a Senate bill crafted around Byron Sher's proposals.  SoCal stated that the Sher bill was "less a matter of using Polanco" and approaches the MOU "from a different direction."  SoCal indicated that "people are currently studying the Hertzberg will to see what the components are."

	Q:	What is your (SoCal's) reaction to the negative article in the LA Times today regarding the legislature's perception of the MOU?  
	A:	SoCal responded that "the LA Times sees the glass as half-empty.  By my comments, I see the glass as half-full.  We are optimistic because there something tangible that people are working on.  The fact that Hertzberg's bill uses the governor's MOU as a foundation provides us with a level of optimism."  However, he emphasized that the company was not in a position to say whether any of the bills would make the utility creditworthy.  

	Q:	Can the governor keep the legislature from recessing in order to force them to pass an MOU?
	A:	SoCal responded, "yes, I understand that he does have that power.  We are running out of days.  The situation is becoming more critical.  We are on borrowed time from our creditors now.  Anything that moves us toward creditworthiness, we support."  (NOTE:  In actuality, the Governor can order legislators to the floor for a vote, but they do not have to comply.  As Burton said in the press today, "Only the legislature can force the legislature to stay.")

Deutsche Bank Questions to SoCal
	Q:	Is the transmission asset sale off the table or not?  
	A:	The sale is in the Assembly bill, but we "think it's more of an option in the Senate bill, like it was in the San Diego deal."

	Q:	What are your (SoCal's) thoughts on how the California Procurement Adjustment (CPA) mechanism could be constructed to keep SoCal solvent and if a change in the mechanism for reimbursing the DWR would be needed?
	A:  	"We are highly focused on this."  The spokesperson stated that if 	revenue is distributed in a manner "that puts the utility in a deteriorating balance sheet situation, this will be seen as a very serious situation.  This would be unacceptable.  Our cash position is currently stable.  These changes, this would be a very serious event."

	Q:	Has SoCal reached an agreement on paying the non-renewables or gas-fired QFs 10% of what they are owed? 
	A:	SoCal indicated that it is still in negotiations with 4 of the larger gas-fired QFs (IEP Projects).  SoCal indicated that it would make its 10% payments once the PUC order to pay is final (a 30-day appeal period is still in effect, according to SoCal).

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

 As set forth in Gary Fergus' e-mail message dated October 6, 2000,
and pursuant to our conference call today, the Enron Entities are producing
the enclosed documents (Bates numbered "Enron Entities 000001-_______")
pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public
Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").

 The Enron Entities produce these documents pursuant to our email
exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission
agrees that by producing these documents, the Enron Entities have not waived
any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any
claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses
have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if
necessary.

 In addition, the Enron Entities produce these documents with the
understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order
than the one currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document
productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In
addition, if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding,
the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests
for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve
the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such
order.

As reported in Tim Taylor's prior email, Judge Moskowitz deferred ruling on
the motion to stay pending resolution of the Section 455 issue.  Judge
Moskowitz rejected plaintiffs' argument that defendants should be required
to formally move to recuse, stating that he felt required to resolve the
Section 455 issue before proceeding further.  On the other hand, he did not
accept our argument that judicial economy favors deferral of the 455 issue
to the MDL Panel, stating instead that he needed to resolve the issue, lest
the Panel designate him as the MDL transferee court for cases he could not
accept.

Judge Moskowitz continued the matter to April 12 at 2:30 pm (PST), at which
time the Court will hear oral argument on both the 455 issue and the stay
motion.  In the interim, the parties will brief the 455 issue in accordance
with the following schedule:

 Plaintiff's brief  -  April 2
 Defendants' response - April 10
 Plaintiff's reply -  April 12

As to the stay motion, Judge Moskowitz indicated he would need to review the
issues raised in the remand briefs before deciding the stay motion.  He
stated that, generally speaking, if the remand motions require substantial
effort and raise issues on which reasonable minds could defer, then he is
inclined to grant a stay, given considerations of judicial economy and the
public's interest in consistent rulings.  While Judge Moskowitz was careful
to note he has not decided this issue, many of the defense counsel who
attended the hearing came away with the impression that the Court is
favorably inclined to the stay arguments.

As to the timing of the remand motion, Judge Moskowitz stated that, if he
does not recuse himself and if he does not stay the cases, the remand motion
will be heard "a couple of weeks" after April 17.   Plaintiffs expressed
concern that the remand motion be heard before the MDL rule in May.  Judge
Moskowitz did not commit to any specific schedule, but appeared receptive to
plaintiffs' position on this timing issue.

A transcript has been ordered and should be available on Monday for
circulation.  Several counsel have suggested that we have a group discussion
after we review the transcript to assess our options on the various issues,
including the Section 455 issue.

As such, we have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, March 28 at 11
am (PST).  The dial in number is 1-800-210-5603 (pass code 5103596#).  I
will circulate an agenda before the call.

Here are the results of our efforts since our last report:

Counsel Interviews:

 Charles Dick
  4:00 p.m.  (he is still waiting for an Orange County jury)
   He is working on clearing conflicts.
   Various offices of Baker have been contacted  for
purposes of this case by:
    NRG, Reliant, Williams, Duke
 David Noonan & Michael Kirby
  Available but not scheduled.  He is working on clearing the
Southern California Edison potential    conflict.
 Michael Weaver
   Will not have conflict results done until Mondayh.
PGE, SDGE and others.  He is still in New York is part of the problem.  He
is available to meet if conflicts clear.  He understands that he needs to
get this done ASAP.
 Dan Lamb
  Available.
Al Stokes Counsel  List
 No action taken to date.
Experts
 Charles River
   Called Gordon Rausser and gave him Richard's contact
information in Houston and suggested he try to meet after meeting with Ken
Lay.
  NERA
   Called again.  Expect to hear back at 3:00 p.m.
today.
Preemption
 Enron's FERC filing today will directly address preemption unless it
is changed immediately.
Removal
 We believe that SEMPRA is a California Corporation with its
principle place of business in San Diego.   Source:  California
Secretary of State On Line Records- Lexis.  If SEMPRA has been served, there
may  be no way to remove based upon diversity unless we can show a sham
(unlikely here.)  If SEMPRA is not  served yet and the other served
defendants agree, maybe we could get removal.  If SEMPRA is later
served, factor in remand.
Election of Judges:
 We are still determining election cycle for Judge Meyer and Judge
Amos.
 According to one counsel that we interviewed, he believes that Judge
Meyer is a "dim bulb on the  chandelier" and Judge Amos is worse.

Attached is the first cut of transaction data we have received from our 
electric desk--physical transactions for about 900 customer meters.  I'd like 
to discuss with you how we can edit or add to this data to make it similar to 
the EPMI data.  Although the customer names are still in here, we will 
replace those with numbers.  MDS

In his comments, Hoecker asks Congress to give FERC retroactive refund 
authority.  By the way this article is wrong about the refund effective 
date.  The current refund effective date is 60 days from the date FERC's 
order was published in the Federal Register.  It was pushed on August 30, so 
if in a future order the Commission were to require refunds, they would be 
calculated beginning October 29th.

Testimony


Law changes needed for retroactive refunds

FERC'S Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority
_______________________________________________
Date: October 2, 2000 -


FERC Chairman James Hoecker (D) told a congressional panel that the 
commission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against 
market power in a competitive environment. Hoecker also urged the congressmen 
to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility 
industry's transition to competition.

Hoecker's plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California, where 
some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after 
prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this 
summer. Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will 
consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the state's bulk 
power markets, it is clear that currently, the commission does not have that 
authority to do so retroactively.

"The [Federal Power Act] would have to be changed," a FERC staffer says.

For its own study -- which began in August -- Hoecker claimed that the 
commission, if proven necessary, would consider ordering refunds if market 
participants were indeed price gouging. However, the Federal Power Act (FPA) 
-- the law that gives the commission much of its authority -- does not 
consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is 
probably needed to see if the commission can do that.

"If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, 
we will do so," Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept. 
21. "If market power is being exercised, we will respond accordingly, by 
revoking or modifying market-based rates or reassuring the basis upon which 
we grant them. We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA, if 
refunds are justified by record evidence. However, the FPA defines the 
commission's authority, and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures 
with California (and other states)."

Currently, the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions 
made 60 days after the commission initiates an investigation, which in this 
case would be Oct. 13. However, the law makes no mention of retroactive 
ratemaking, and FERC officials admit that to do so, the law needs to be 
changed.

"Based upon what I know, the authority of the commission to issue refunds for 
any period before 60 days following our [investigation] order is highly 
problematic," Commissioner William Massey (D) told Electric Power Alert. 
"There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that, it would be 
unlawful and we would need legislation to do that."

The Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), held a 
mid-afternoon Sept. 21 hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a 
severe energy crisis this winter. The committee heard testimony from Hoecker, 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Administrator Carol Browner.

Much of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets, but both 
Richardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for 
failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year. Richardson 
expressed his "disappointment" that nothing passed, while Hoecker claimed 
that FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power.

"Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United 
States under the same rules for non-discriminatory open access and comparable 
service," Hoecker said. "The commission's open access rules are not binding 
on the part of the nation's transmission system . . . owned or controlled by 
entities other than public utilities. Open access over the facilities of 
public power and other non-public utilities would promote greater competition 
in wholesale markets, by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers 
and sellers."

Hoecker pointed to FERC's investigation into bulk power markets and 
California's energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives 
clear legislative direction, FERC will extremely limited in what it could do 
to solve the market problems.

"Congress, too, has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to 
obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices," Hoecker said. "Most 
critically, events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting 
electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition. 
Federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate 
investment in generation and transmission facilities, and higher levels of 
reliability which is crucial to the digital economy."

The chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate 
regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability 
standards. Currently, the House is considering a bill that would make the 
commission a federal backstop for reliability, but most congressional sources 
do not expect the bill to pass (see related story).

FYI.  Attached please find a legal cite that indicates that the federal 
government would be the guarantor of the sales under the DOE order.  I have 
no idea if this is correct.

I do not doubt that the government can order the utilities to keep supplying
electricity, but I think the federal government is now the guarantor of
payment.  See the Supreme Court's 1996 decision in the Winstar case.

Perspective on California and refunds.



GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION'S REPORT

The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis' remarks on the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) report:

"My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity
affordable. That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this
complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making
a good start.

"Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in
San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable
power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support
financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs
up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when
we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a
number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that
reduce the demand on any given day.

"Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult
environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can
work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is
competitive, which it is not.

"I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this
market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial
reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do
recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree
that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I
encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who
were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that
San Diego had to suffer through.

"FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent
service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are
self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market
manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The
good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is
dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is
no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.

"I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going
to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to
drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and
again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give
us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon
us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the
moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for
electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop.

Question inaudible.

"It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this
again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state
deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically
surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of
electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision
today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake
holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be
new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it
is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to
establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press
reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up
over the next several days.

Question inaudible.

"We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of
stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups
from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate
the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what
that consensus is. But we are making progress.

Question inaudible.

"That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the
full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and
the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is
not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can
generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and
day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs
for this ill-conceived scheme.

"I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is
dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not
pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going
to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which
their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment,
critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted
in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our
administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the
consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not
before.

"I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy
have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and
reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is
unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress
could settle

the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long
haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work
but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act
responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may
win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and
citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will
rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation
lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the
immediate horizon.

Question inaudible.

"Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around
but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state
companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity
that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An
electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised
scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am
standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We
are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we
used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson
signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored
by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well
maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in
1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on
whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a
good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some
limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the
generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own
and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out
of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it
is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own
power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no
question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous
and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone
accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You
cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of
electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So
these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no
public official participates on those boards.

Question inaudible.

"You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am
going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers
and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water
and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck.
Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a
question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today.
Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in
1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to
monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state.
FERC seems to be suggesting

today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as
much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable
and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility
that is laid at my doorstep.

"I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights
stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the
prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than
that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to
allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a
profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn
provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the
environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic
growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice
to our public obligations. Thank you for coming out here today.

Hello Energyphiles:

OK, perhaps it was inevitable.  But it is now official.  A team of San
Diego's best anti-trust and class action attorneys has been assembled to
take on the electric generators and marketers in California state court in
an effort to return the electricity overcharges that have battered San
Diego and the rest of California this year.    A press conference will be
held to discuss the consumer class action lawsuit to be filed today.

WHEN:   11am - noon

WHERE:    550 West C  St.  (b/t Columbia & India)
  Suite 1810
  Law Offices of Levine, Steinberg, Miller & Huver
  619-231-9449

WHAT:  Copies of the filed complaint will be made available at that
time.  UCAN's   executive director and the attorney team will be
available
to answer questions   about the complaint.   We are hopeful that
we can
post the complaint to the   UCAN web site later today.

Attached are the cover letter and narrative responses ENA will provide this afternoon to FERC for the non-public investigation into California natural gas prices.  Please advise me as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  

These are basically requests for the same information as we have provided previously in the San Diego  and the CPUC complaint proceedings.  The main difference is in the time period covered.  The San Diego and CPUC data requests were for November-December, 2000 and January-April, 2001, respectively, and this request is for information from May 1999 for any contracts in effect on May 10, 2001. 

I am still waiting for the files with the actual data, and I will forward them as soon as available.

Pursuant to its December 15, 2000 Order (EL00-95-000) (December Order), FERC 
released its Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and 
Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market (Report), 
issued March 9th, addressing mitigation of price volatility in the California 
markets.  Comments on the Report are due on Thursday, March 22nd.  The 
following is a summary of the Report, along with an outline of possible EPSA 
comments.  We will discuss the report and EPSA's comments further on our 
weekly Power Marketers conference call.  To access the call, dial 
1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any 
questions, please feel free to contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or  
eperrigo@epsa.org.

Report Summary

Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five 
percent of the market that remains in real-time and not to the bilateral and 
forward markets, the Report immediately notes that "ultimately the real 
solution to California's problems lies in increased investments in 
infrastructure."

The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a real-time auction 
with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic 
withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of 
scarcity:

(1) Coordinating and Controlling Outages -  The ISO should coordinate and 
approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator 
Agreement (PGA) with the ISO.  Coordination and outage control procedures 
should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review 
should be expedited.  Similarly, the ISO should closely monitor unplanned 
outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation.

(2) Selling Obligations - All capacity that is available and not scheduled to 
run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the real-time market  - this 
obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO day-ahead 
markets.  PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity 
for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to 
calculate marginal costs, such as heat rate.  FERC Staff would then use this 
data, in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to 
determine a price that the ISO would use pre-determined to mitigate prices 
during times of reserve deficiency.  Load Serving Entities should also be 
required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be 
curtailed.

(3) Price Mitigation - When called upon to provide the available and 
unscheduled capacity as mentioned above, PGA unit prices would be mitigated 
in hours when there is a reserve deficiency, or Stage 3 emergencies (the 
Report notes that it is "these hours which are extremely conducive to the 
exercise of market power by suppliers") and will be obligated to sell 
capacity in real-time at the marginal cost of the highest-priced PGA until 
called upon to run.

(4) Real-time Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit - all generating 
units should have a standing, confidential price based on its marginal 
costs.  This price will be used by the ISO to establish the real-time market 
clearing price when mitigation is appropriate.  Staff believes that a single 
market clearing price auction design is appropriate, thus reversing the 
recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order.

(5) Market Clearing Price - All real-time energy offers should be paid the 
applicable market clearing price.

(6) Conditions for Invoking Mitigation - Mitigation measures should only be 
applied to critical operating periods, such as emergencies.

As noted in the Report, Staff recognizes that there are potential 
difficulties in implementing the proposal, and that "there are no easy 
answers to the current problems in the California market."  Among the 
purported difficulties, Staff notes implementation problems with bidding 
obligations on imported power, incentive effects on load scheduling, 
treatment of purchased power, mitigating prices during emergencies, and 
setting a price component for scarcity.

Suggested EPSA Comments

EPSA has a number of concerns with the proposal, however there are a few 
things we commend.  Namely:  (1) the Staff's timely turnaround of the report, 
as directed in the December Order; (2) their admission that the overarching 
problem cannot be solved by these shorter-term mitigation measures, only by 
increased investments in infrastructure; and (3) recommendation of the single 
price auction in the real-time market, noting that it should be used for only 
approximately five percent of the market.  Also, to stress the importance of 
regulatory certainty, the Report recommends a date-certain "sunset" for the 
mitigation approach of no more than one year.

Areas of concern include:

(1) It is not acceptable to use a cost-based model to explain what happens to 
prices in a shortage period.  The oil shortages of the 1970s are a good 
illustration - a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first 
quadrupling of oil prices from about $3 to $12 per barrel.  Similarly, prices 
rose to $42 in 1980 with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply.

(2) Staff's proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not 
create a market clearing price in scarcity situations, and does not take into 
account the customer's value of the commodity.  To the extent seller's costs 
are used, full costs are not included Staff's recommendation.  As outlined in 
EPSA's recently filed white paper on market monitoring, full costs should 
include opportunity costs, scarcity value, capacity value, and risk.

(3) The Report fails to link high prices to any anti-competitive behavior, 
yet still alleges such behavior throughout the Report.

(4) EPSA opposes the forced bidding into the real-time market as 
recommended.  This prescription precludes and preempts competitive business 
decisions and retards the healthy development of the market.

(5) The Report's method for calculating the market clearing price is not 
illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing 
price.  The method proposed in FERC's refund order of March 9th may be 
preferable to the method proposed in this Report.  Staff's method only 
includes participating generators and does not include imports, and 
out-of-market purchases.  EPSA prefers a method that is more inclusive of 
details and characteristics of a true market.

Calif. Reconsiders On Utility Fees

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California regulators agreed Tuesday to reconsider 
whether utilities can charge customers for the billions of dollars in losses 
that piled up during a summer of soaring electricity prices.

Responding to an emergency petition by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and 
Southern California Edison Co. [AMEX:SCEq - news], the California Public 
Utilities Commission left open the possibility of reversing five prior 
decisions that blocked the companies from recovering the losses from 
customers.

Regulators turned down the utilities' request for an immediate stay of those 
past decisions, but the mere chance of rate relief may be enough to allow 
PG&E and SoCal Edison to dodge a possible bullet in the stock market.

Had the PUC reaffirmed its previous decision, the utilities probably would 
have had to write off several billion dollars in losses on their financial 
statements in the third or fourth quarter.

Disclosures about the likely losses almost certainly would have been made in 
a third-quarter Securities and Exchange Commission filing due by mid-November.

If the utilities were forced to make grim financial disclosures, ``it would 
be very negative for the stocks,'' said Carol Coale, a utility industry 
analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston. ``Right now, the fate of these 
utilities is in the hands of their regulators and their bankers.''

Coale estimated PG&E faced the prospect of writing off as much as $3 billion 
in losses this year.

PG&E had little to say about Tuesday's decision.

``This is a very serious issue and we want to thoroughly review the material 
before commenting further,'' said PG&E spokesman Ron Low.

Consumer activists blasted the PUC's decision.

``This is a sop to the financial markets,'' said Nettie Hoge, executive 
director for TURN, a San Francisco watchdog group. ``By reopening this case, 
the PUC is unleashing a tsunami of lawyers that is going to come in and argue 
why we should have to pay for these losses.''

TURN plans to release a report Wednesday contending that California utilities 
have generated an additional $18 billion in revenue from deregulation, more 
than enough to offset recent losses.

Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights, accused the PUC and Gov. Gray Davis' administration of ``caving in to 
the utilities. These companies just want to be able to go to Wall Street and 
say they still have a chance of getting this money back.''

PUC President Loretta Lynch did not return a call seeking comment.

Rosenfield said his group will ask the SEC to investigate whether accounting 
laws require the utilities to write off their losses immediately.

San Francisco-based PG&E says it has lost $2.2 billion this year from a 
freeze on electric rates imposed as part of industry deregulation. 
Rosemead-based SoCal Edison places its losses from the freeze at about $2 
billion.

The utilities are losing money because they must buy the power in the 
wholesale market, where prices have unexpectedly tripled and, at times, 
quadrupled over the past year. The freeze on their customer rates isn't 
scheduled to expire until March 2002.

To insulate themselves, the utilities this week filed a petition with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeking to cap wholesale prices for 
electricity at $100-per-megawatt hour. The current cap in California is 
$250-per-megawatt hour.

The chasm between the utilities' wholesale costs and retail rates is hurting 
the companies' standing on Wall Street.

In a filing with the PUC last week, SoCal Edison noted that ``the investment 
community is expressing growing concern'' about the utility's ability to 
recover its losses. SoCal Edison urged regulators to ``take action which 
will, at a minimum, send the right signal to the financial markets.''

Attached find a draft of Seabron and Carl's white paper in the Section 206 
proceeding with my suggested revisions and comments in redline and 
strikeout.  I think they did an excellent job.  I have also attached a short 
(but detailed) outline of the white paper for those of you who don't have 
time to read the white paper.  If you have any comments on this please get 
them to me ASAP as I would like to file this paper at FERC on Friday.  Ron 
Carroll is drafting a pleading to accompany it to FERC.  

A couple of general comments for Seabron and Carl: 
I did not move it but the section on information and governance should be 
moved to the beginning of the paper as these are the most important problems 
to Enron.  
It's not always clear whether you are referring to the FERC doing something 
or the PUC.  
You may want to add some of the recommendations and observations that the PX 
made in its recent analysis of price activity: May - July 2000.
I hope I didn't mess up you numbering too much.

Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP") for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excess energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything wrong."  

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk.


Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38

Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].

ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.

Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?

ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I've got to get something.

Unknown:  Stage one at 11.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I'm on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid in?

Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.

Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].

ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,?.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn't on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn't matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price.

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we're not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We're not.  No, we're not, okay.  We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we wanted you, if it's possible, to continue to set that, whether it's 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um?..

ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back?.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up high.   

Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.

Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it back?.

ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that's ridiculous.

ISO:  Allen:  That's really ticking us off and right now . . .

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that's probably Powerex, isn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  There's about four of them right now.

Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.

ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn't, we didn't, we took them out.  Basically, we're not allowing  anything over the ties.

Enron:  Ryan:  I didn't submit one for 17 or ?.

ISO:  Allen:  That's fine.  They'll probably go to a penny and they'll probably get excited and do a bunch, and we'll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It's actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it.

Enron:  Ryan: Okay.

ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.

Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:46:55 - 14:47:40 (3 minutes later)

Enron:  This is Ryan.

ISO:  Hey Ryan, its Allen.

Enron:  Ryan:  Yeah.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, did you put it in for the next hour?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16?

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah, no, they already ran 17.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, I didn't do 17, no.

ISO:  Allen:  Well, see, we're gonna run, we're gonna run 18 coming up here in the next fifteen minutes.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.

ISO:  Allen:  If you have any questions, let me know.  I hope you know this is me from the ISO.  I don't know if you think I'm somebody else but you can call me at the hour-ahead desk.

Enron:  Ryan:  Well, I mean, I'm talking to my boss right now as far as, because of, you know, I don't want to be doing anything that's wrong.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah? 

Enron:  Ryan:  Even if it is helping you guys out, if it's wrong, I can't do it.

ISO:  Allen:  I know, but if you continue to bid in at, um, the market, that's the best thing to do.  For replacement.  All right.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  Thanks, man.

So, why did the ISO make the attachments confidential if it does not believe that they are confidential.  If the attachments are to be released, they should be released to everyone. How do we make that happen?

Further, the CA ISO is in receipt of an interim order from the California
Public Utilities Commission in its OII 00-08-002, providing for additional
protection for confidential information, including information subject to
the subpoena issued to the CA ISO (circulated to Market Participants on
September 25 and attached herein for your convenience).

Finally, the EOB has requested copies of the ISO operator logs and morning
reports that are responsive to the CPUC subpoena.  These documents would be
subject to the agreement as to confidentiality for confidential information
produced to the EOB that was arrived at this summer (see letter circulated
to Market Participants on September 25 and attached herein for your
convenience)

The CA ISO will proceed with production in response to the AG and CPUC
subpoenas (and provision of responsive logs and morning reports to the EOB)

Subject: University of California/California State University Litigation

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication

Rex,

Vicki asked me to provide you with a description of this litigation.

The University of California and California State University are Direct 
Access customers of EES.  Many of their campuses are in the PG&E and So Cal 
Edison service territories.  Last fall, due to their deteriorating financial 
condition these two utilities began defaulting on their obligation to remit 
to EES the "negative CTCs" attributable to EES's customers.  "Negative CTCs" 
reimburse EES for the cost of procuring power for its customers.  It is EES's 
position that these amounts are owed to it under a 1998 settlement agreement 
with the utilities, as well as under the utilities' tariffs.  EES has filed a 
complaint with the California Public Utilities Commission against both 
utilities to collect the amounts owed.  PG&E owes approximately $380 
million.  So Cal Edison owes approximately $120 million.  The complaint 
against PG&E is stayed due to the bankruptcy filing.  The MOU and Advice 
Letter between So Cal Edison and the State appear to provide for the payment 
of Negative CTCs to ESPs, but that agreement has not been approved yet.

In early 2001, there was a growing concern that because of their worsening 
financial condition PG&E and So Cal Edison might not be able to pay the 
future Negative CTCs.  EES therefore decided to cap or end its exposure to 
the cost of procuring power on behalf of its customers.  It effectively did 
so by "re-sourcing" its customers back to the utilities. This occurred on 
February 1, 2001.  Thenceforth, (until the Department of Water Resources 
stepped in), the utilities bought power for EES's customers.

The only customer to object to EES's action (to the point of filing suit) has 
been UC/CSU.  Almost all of the other customers have been indifferent, 
largely owing to the fact that EES has kept the customers financially whole 
on their contracts with EES (i.e., the customer continues to pay 5% less than 
the frozen rate for its power, just as it always did).  UC/CSU may have 
viewed the situation differently because, once the DWR began purchasing the 
power instead of the utilities, the State had the supply risk.  The UC/CSU 
contact is one of the few contracts that permits a court challenge to a 
party's actions; almost all of the other contracts provide for mandatory 
arbitration.

The suit was filed in March in federal district court in San Francisco.  
UC/CSU moved immediately for a preliminary injunction (i.e.an order to 
preserve the status quo pending a full trial on the merits) to be restored to 
Direct Access service.  The State Attorney General filed an amicus curiae 
brief supporting the Universities' application.  On April 20, the court 
granted UC/CSU's request for a preliminary njunction.  The court ruled that 
there was a strong likelihood that UC/CSU would prevail on the merits, and 
that they would suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the injunction were 
not granted.  The "immediate and irreparable harms" cited were loss of 
specialized metering services, uncertainty about being eligible for Direct 
Access in the future, loss of scheduling coordination services, and general 
uncertainty caused by the bankruptcy of PG&E.  We think the Judge erred, and 
have filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit and have requested a stay of the 
court's order.  Because of the standard of appellate review, we are not 
highly confident of having the decision overturned.  We expect a ruling early 
next week.     

If the decision stands, it is estimated that EES will incur $144 million 
procuring power for UC/CSU until the contract expires in March 2002.  This 
will increase the Negative CTC amounts already owed by PG&E and So Cal Edison 
(this may not be dollar-for-dollar, depending on how the Negative CTC will be 
calculated in the wake of the bankruptcy of the PX).  Obviously, to the 
extent we are able to recover the Negative CTC from PG&E and So Cal Edison, 
this exposure is mitigated.

It is difficult to predict whether other customers will follow suit.  Since 
they are not affliated with the State, they do not have the same incentive as 
UC/CSU to challenge EES's action.  Moreover, their contracts do not contain 
the number or sophistication of services as the UC/CSU contract, so it will 
be more difficult for them to obtain an injunction ordering specific 
performance.  Arbitration may also be a bar to suing in court. 

Please let me know if you need any additional information.  My cell phone 
number is 281-414-0364.

Here is the quick overview of the false claims act in California.  Keep in
mind that the California AG has offered a $50,000,000 bounty or more for
information leading to successful false claims act cases that show that
wholesale prices were too high.

> * Knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to an officer or

> subdivision. (Sec. 12651(a)(3))
> * Having possession, custody, or control of public property or money
> used or to be used by the state or by any political subdivision and
> knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered less property than the
> amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt.  (Sec.

> * Being a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim to
> the state or a political subdivision who subsequently discovers the
> falsity of the claim, and fails to disclose the false claim to the state
> or the political subdivision within a reasonable time after discovery of
> the false claim.  (Sec. 12651(a)(8))
>
> Section 12652 of the CFCA provides, inter alia, that a person ("a qui tam

> Several other provisions of Section 12652 could be extremely important:
>
> * When a qui tam plaintiff brings an action under this subdivision, no
> other person (qui tam plaintiff) may bring a related action based on the
> facts underlying the pending action. (Sec. 12652(c)(10))
> * A qui tam plaintiff may not bring an action that is based upon
> allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an
> administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the state or
> political subdivision is already a party.  (Sec. 12652 (d)(2))
> * A qui tam plaintiff may only be "an original source" with direct and
> independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are
> based.  A qui tam plaintiff may not obtain information from the news media
> or from public disclosure of the information in governmental or regulatory
> hearings, investigations, reports, etc. and use it to bring suit under the
> CFCA. (Sec. 12652 (d)(3))
> * If the qui tam plaintiff is a state employee, that person must
> exhaust various internal procedures before filing suit under the CFCA
> (Sec. 12652 (d)(4))
> * If the state, a political subdivision, or the qui tam plaintiff
> proceeds with the action, the court may award to the defendant its
> reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the party that proceeded
> with the action if the defendant prevails in the action and the court
> finds that the claim was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought

>
> Other relevant provisions of the CFCA include:
>
> * The CFCA defines "knowing" and "knowingly" to mean that a person,
> with respect to information  "(A) Has actual knowledge of the information.
> (B) Acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the
> information. [or] (C) Acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity
> of the information."  Importantly, proof of specific intent to defraud is
> not required.  (Sec. 12650(b)(2))
> * The CFCA has various damages limitations provisions for defendants

> * The CFCA has various "whistleblower" provisions protecting employees

I attended the U.C. Berkeley POWER (Program on Workable Energy Regulation)
Conference on March 16.  Here is a brief report on the relevant parts.
Notably, the Lieff, Cabreser duo of Bill Bernstein and Barry Himmelstein
were there, listening carefully.

The program consisted of the presentation of 8 economic studies, followed by
comments from two discussants, followed by audience questions/comments.  The
following is a list of the papers and the discussants who presented with
slides, taken from the website of the U.C. Energy Institute,
http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/conf2001/order_papers2001.html:  You can
click on this to see the slides, in PDF format.  The papers in green are not
particularly relevant for our purposes, and I won't say more about them
beyond the note in brackets.  The presenter's name is in bold.

  "Bidding Asymmetries in Multi-Unit Auctions: Implications of
Bid Function Equilibria in the British Spot Market for Electricity" by Greg
Crawford, Duke University, Joe Crespo, NERA, and Helen Tauchen, University
of North Carolina
  "Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated
Electricity Market" by Steve Puller, UC Berkeley
   Discussion by Anjali Sheffrin, California
Independent System Operator
  "Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using
Observed Bid Data: An Application to Electricity Markets" by Frank Wolak,
Stanford University [A paper about economic "tools" to study power markets.]
  "Forward Contracts and the Curse of Market Power" by Jeffrey
Lien , University of Maryland
  "The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity
Consumption in San Diego" by James Bushnell and Erin Mansur, UC Berkeley
[This looks at whether consumption declined with price increases.  Not
much.]
  "Consumption and Home Energy Costs: How Prevalent is the
'Heat or Eat' Decision?" by Julie Berry Cullen, University of Michigan,
Leora Friedberg, University of Virginia, and Catherin Wolfram, UC Berkeley
[A macro study on how consumers change overall spending patterns when they
have to shell out more $$ for power.]
  "A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior in California's
Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000" by Paul Joskow, MIT, and
Edward Kahn, Analysis Group
  "Electricity Restructuring and the Cost of Pollution
Reduction" by Dallas Burtraw, Karen Palmer, Ranjit Bharvirkar, and Anthony
Paul, Resources for the Future

Before I discuss the specific papers and presenters, one big picture point
needs to be made.  There was an unchallenged consensus at this conference
that the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions of
dollars.  The focus was on how and how much, not whether.  The good news is
that I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory; the thought was
that generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowing
they could influence the market price given the auction rules and the
completely inelastic demand.  On the other hand, I would have to say that
the economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at best.
The bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggering
-- >$5 billion.  The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damage
study.

Crespo, Bidding Asymmetries in UK:  This is a marginally relevant paper
examining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in a
leader-follower mode, i.e., asymmetrically.  Crespo's model shows that in a
uniform price-setting auction with clearing price rules, a price setter will
emerge and take all prices above marginal cost.  Thus, above marginal cost
pricing does not require coordination.  Crespo (from NERA) appeared
knowledgeable, but is not an inspiring speaker.  His paper also got roughed
up a bit in the audience questioning segment.

Puller, Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity
Market:  This is a very relevant paper, as it tries to determine whether
market power (presumably) exercised in California was static or dynamic,
meaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking (static) or tacit
collusion (dynamic).  The period studied was 4/98 to 12/99.  Puller found
evidence of static market power consistent with so-called "Cournot pricing."
This theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivals'
observed price/output decisions as a given and decide how to maximize
profitability given that behavior.  He then tried to determine whether any
dynamic games were occurring, meaning a game where firms recognize their
interdependence and try to follow a "supergame trigger strategy" in which
firms try to induce favorable responses from rivals.  It's quite complicated
how he goes about this, but fundamentally he tries to correlate observed
output decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a change
in its behavior to affect its future share of the market.  With this
methodology, Puller finds what he called "weak evidence" of forward-looking
dynamic pricing for a brief time in 1998, but not otherwise.  My impression
was that the evidence for 1998 was very weak, and the logic used to arrive
at this conclusion was also weak.

Puller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts to
determine what a firm's "supply function" would look like if it was
exercising static and dynamic market power, and then comparing this to an
estimate of that firm's actual supply function.  I found this even more
speculative than the first theory.  Nonetheless, the results are basically
the same:  evidence of static, but not dynamic market power.

Puller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during the
questioning segment.  He's not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to me
to be a strong expert candidate.

Anjali Sheffrin's commentary was very important.  She is the Director of
Market Analysis for CAISO.  After general comments on Crespo and Puller, she
launched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the California
experience.  This turned out to be a preview of the CAISO FERC filing of
last week, in which they allege $5.5 billion in market power-related
overcharges from May 200 to Feb. 2001.  That filing and Sheffrin's report
follow.  They are essential reading.

  <<2001032214541122276.pdf.pdf>>  <<2001032214585222924.pdf.pdf>>

Sheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this period
that left the market power of the California generators unchecked.  This
permitted the in-state generators to engage in either economic or physical
withholding of power.  (Economic withholding is bidding a higher-than-needed
supply curve; physical withholding is cutting output at the plant.)  Her
study was intended to (1) Identify individual firms engaging in market power
activity, and (2) Analyze how each firms' actions set market clearing
prices.  She utilized full bidding data in CA ISO real time market for
each hour between May and Nov 2000, defined and categorized bidding patterns
and identified economic or physical withholding, and then calculated
bid-cost mark-up and a monopoly rent.  She found what she claimed was strong
evidence of both types of withholding, but that economic withholding is the
dominant bidding pattern used by the five large California generators.
While Sheffrin's study does not name names, it claims that "most of the five
in-state suppliers and many of the [16] large importers displayed bidding
patterns which were consistent with the exercise of market power."

Bernstein and Himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentation.

On the question of collusion, Sheffrin's study is not terribly illuminating.
She maintains that "the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with two
characteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolist
pricing."  I take that to mean Cournot, which is a static, non-collusive
model.  However, when you read her study, you'll see the picture is not
entirely clear.

Lien, The Curse of Market Power:  This is only marginally relevant for us,
as its thesis is that forward-looking supply contracts are better for both
producers and society.  Everyone seemed to agree -- and were confused why we
needed a paper to prove it.  Lien (U. Md.) is young and not expert material.

Joskow and Kahn:  http://www.mit.edu/people/pjoskow/JK_PaperREVISED.pdf
(paper);  http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/conf2001/Slides/Kahn_Slides.pdf
(Kahn's slides).   I'm sure many of you have already read this; everyone
should.  Prepared for SoCal Edison, it contends that 4 in-state generators
(Reliant, Dynegy, AES/Williams, and Southern/Mirant) exercised market power
by withholding capacity during the summer or 2000.

J&K use publicly available data on loads, market prices and generation to
(a) quantify combined effects of "market fundamentals" on market prices, (b)
calculate "price gap" (difference between actual prices and "competitive"
market benchmarks), (c) account for quantify effects of ISO's ancillary
services requirements and forced outages, and then (d) calculate the "output
gap" for high priced hours, meaning the difference between observed and
maximum profitable levels of generation.  They conclude that prices were far
in excess of the competitive benchmark and that the 4 in-state generators
could have produced more power at competitive prices but chose not to.
Hence, market power was exercised.

Kahn, the Analysis Group economist who presented, is a very colorful and
rather undisciplined advocate of his position.  He threw around allegations
of conspiracy rather casually, but mostly to be funny.  I couldn't tell
whether he believed his study proved that; I don't think it even speaks to
it.  But Bernstein and Himmelstein applauded him when he finished, grinning
ear to ear.

Severin Borenstein, UC Berkeley and the conference director, was supposed to
comment on J&K, but hardly did.  He said that the generators would have been
stupid not to exercise market power given the supply/demand conditions and
the market rules, and argued that permitting long term contracts and
requiring real-time residential pricing were the solutions to all of this.
Borenstein was the best expert material I saw at this conference, and the
fact he took a pass on the details of the J&K paper is puzzling to me.  It
made me wonder whether he already has a horse in this race, or perhaps is
trying to "stay above it all."

Hope this is useful.

Richard,
 We need to have an electronic copy of the Real Time spreadsheets for
EPMI located on the M Drive in Houston for the period 1/01/00 to date.  They
are needed for two purposes:  (1) to respond by next Wednesday to a FERC
request for data about Out of Market Transactions; and (2) to evaluate the
contents of those spreadsheets in the context of the California litigation.
The specific documents that we need have been identified by Jeff Richter.
We need approval to have these documents copied to a CD and sent via courier
to me today.  I believe that Dan Dietrich is also aware of the specific
documents that are needed.  If the approval is granted, Jeff Richter can
make the CD in Portland and have it sent via courier to me.  Alternatively,
if the CD is made in Houston, it should be sent to me for guaranteed
Saturday delivery at the following address:

Subject: CAISO Notice:  SCE's  Letter Notification and ISO Response


Market notice:

On January 24, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received by fax a letter
from John R. Fielder, Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Policy Affairs
at Southern California Edison (SCE).  Mr. Fielder stated that SCE was
providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO Tariff "that
SCE will not be performing all of its obligations under the ISO Tariff
because it will not be paying every invoice due to Uncontrollable Forces, as
defined in the ISO Tariff."  Mr. Fielder stated that the Uncontrollable
Forces were "regulations and restrictions imposed by governmental
authorities, including without limitation, the CPUC's order of January 4,
2001, that failed to authroize SCE to obtain, and restricted SCE from
obtaining sufficient funds to enable SCE to meet its payment obligations."
Mr. Fielder further stated that, "[b]ecause SCE's action is due to
Uncontrollable Forces, the ISO should not attempt to exercise any remedies
against SCE for non-performance and SCE will hold the ISO responsible for
the consequences of the ISO exercising any such remedies."  Finally, Mr.
Fielder stated that SCE was using its best efforts to mitigate the effects
of the regulations and restrictions and would continue to do so.  The CEO of
the California ISO has written to Mr. Fielder stating that it is studying
the position taken in Mr. Fielder's letter and that for the moment it
neither accepts nor rejects the position.  The purpose of this market notice
is to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against
SCE based on SCE's failure to pay ISO invoices.

FYI.  Appears that the Davis administration has thrown down the gauntlet, 
looking to position itself in a way that will allow it to blame the FERC/Bush 
administration for California's electricity crisis, unless FERC agrees to the 
ISO's price cap plan.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: FW: CAISO Notice - Draft Market Stabilization Plan


Greetings:
Late last night the ISO released a Market Stabilization plan that would
essentially impose cost based pricing control caps and apply a strict
California First Policy.

Here's ISO's 3-page sketch to impose cost-based pricing intended to control
costs on consumers on very short order.  Unit-specific cost-based bid caps
will apply to ISO markets.  ISO will have dispatch control over all CA
generation.  Capital costs and return appear to be excluded from the bid
caps.  ISO will pick of the day-ahead and day-of energy markets lot to the
demise of CalPX, thus ending the "market separation."  There appears to be
language that intimates direct unit dispatch, but the document is very thin
on this. ISO proposes payments based either on the "as-bid" up to unit bid
cap, or apparently a uniform market-clearing price based on marginal units
cap.  Out of state resources are paid California capped rates.  Settlement
will be on numbers other than those posted (so much for transparency).
There's looking to procure AS based on optimization, although this is not
spelled out well (it appears that self-provision is gummed up completely).

To prevent "MW Laundering" CA will required in-area generation to make all
capacity
available whenever Stage 1 or higher emergency (i.e., reserves below 7%).
This California
First! rule means the generation must be scheduled against CA loads or bid
into day-ahead
market.  If you don't bid your bid cap is applied.  There will be a capacity
element
similar to RMR.  This change will require FERC buy-in, which obviously will
be
litigation-central, and its likely to create a cascade of similar
requirements from other
states ...

Thanks Andy for the quick summary!

IEP will monitor the Friday call and review all documents to let people know
what is happening.

Attached is the EWS Tax Group's analysis of California Assembly Bill No. 128 
- the proposed "excise tax" on energy marketer's gross receipts on the sale 
of electricity in excess of a predetermined amount (initially set at 
$60/megawatt).  Please call me with any questions.  Best regards.  Steve.

FYI.
Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC's questions.  It is still
missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting.  I
believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft.
He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego
litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to
specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers
market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine
that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.
Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate
the problem.  There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get
it, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal
court that there has been preemption.  As a practical matter, however, our
preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to
preempt anti-trust laws, for example, the preemption argument may be
difficult to make anyway.  Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the one
chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.  If FERC does make the
finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not know how to assess the
likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding, and if they do whether
it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit
analysis.

 If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional
phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  "if they were not in
violation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs."

 Talk to you tomorrow.

Thanks
Gary

Subject: Draft Responses to Chairman Hoecker's Questions


As you will see, the attached draft incorporates Sue's and Mary's drafts as
well as additional text from me.  The comments filed on Nov. 22 are
literally one foot high. If the Commission is serious about getting an order
out by mid-December, it is thus highly unlikely that it will carefully
review any of the Comments other than the major players (CPUC, Gov. Davis,
the UDCs).  I do believe, however, that Chairman Hoecker, the Commissioners
and the high level Staffers will be more likely to review the responses to
Hoecker's questions.  Thus, if we are to have any realistic hope that they
will focus on our arguments, I thought it advisable to use these responses
as an advocacy piece rather than a mere discovery response.  Hence, I
suggest a lengthy rather than minimalist response.

I thought that Gary's concern in an earlier email about Alan's rebuttal to
the J&K piece was well taken.  I have thus taken out all references to a
need to do more analysis on the market abuse issue, and recast his write-up
as simply a rebuttal of the J&K Study.

Finally, the draft (which I have included in Word and WP formats/ the WP
format may paginate more accurately) is no doubt in need of wordsmithing;
any suggestions would be well appreciated.

I would like to file this tomorrow, so please call or email me as early in
the morning as possible.  (I am not sending this email from my computer, so
please create a new email to me when you respond rather than simply hit the
"reply" button to this email.)  Talk to you tomorrow (Friday).

Ron

In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.  However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.  

At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.  As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty.  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.

The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.

Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding.

Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.

Attached is a memo I prepared for Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes regarding FERC's investigation into potential refunds for Pacific Northwest spot sales.  I'm circulating the memo in anticipation of questions during the conference call tomorrow.  Gary Fergus and/or Dan Watkiss will likely have further observations.

Here is today's status report:

FERC

 Megawatt Daily reports that requests for rehearing before FERC have
been filed even though the November 1, 2000 draft order is not yet final.
Cal PX said they could not implement the software necessary to run the soft
caps by January 1st.    The City San Diego requested rehearing on the issue
of whether FERC has the authority to order refunds.  The City of San Diego's
Friday filing said the SDG&E had $800M in its "balancing account" that it
would be seeking from ratepayers.  The City argued that because their were
not just and reasonable rates, the filed rate doctrine is not called into
question.

Charles Dick

 I spoke with Charles Dick about his personal availability.  He told
me that he understood we were asking for a personal commitment from him.  He
has one matter that is set for arbitration in June, 2001 that will take a
significant amount of this time.  He has other matters, but is willing to
personally commit the time necessary for this engagement.  He had the same
approach as in the interview- not selling himself, but being completely
responsive.

David Noonan

 David called to tell me he had left messages for Richard but they
had not connected yet.  In part, it was because David was in deposition.  We
discussed conflict issues at some length.  In the copper cases where he
represents SCE, they have a 1.5% and 3% share of the damages at issue.
Thus, he is not acting as longstanding SCE counsel.  He said that he did not
believe that he could get a written forward looking waiver, since the
general counsel does not see this representation as a current conflict.  He
agreed, however, that he would be able to confirm that in the event that
Enron and SCE become adverse, while he would not be able to represent either
entity in that litigation, if he is still representing them in the copper
litigation, SCE would not claim that his continued representation of Enron
in the non-adverse matters was a violation of the duty of loyalty.  David
was going to continue to try and connect with Richard.

Larry Ruff

 Larry has reviewed the preliminary data that we were proposing to
release to the PUC.  In particular, I asked him to take the view of a
regulator and use the data to show market power, withholding electricity,
etc.  He told me that the data was not all that helpful in any of those
regards.  First, he found the same anomalies later in the year with respect
to energy purchased and energy sold.  He also had some questions about the
identity of various counterparties used in the system.  He found that the
data did not include price by the hour -- instead only the 24 hour
aggregate.  To the extent that we want to understand what happened during
peak periods, we would need the detailed data.  We also discussed finding
out what sources of public market data were available to understand what was
happening in the market to compare the Enron data with.  Larry has completed
the initial quick look that we asked for.  He will be in Australia for the
next few months.  We have made arrangements for encrypted email etc. to be
available so that we may consult with him as needed.

Tariffs and FERC related Materials

 Jean asked for the reference to the legal requirement to submit a
balanced schedule etc.  Peter Meringolo from our office gathered this
material earlier and we include it below.  We also enclose Ron Carol's brief
that he sent us that challenges the penalty provisions of the ISO tariff.
That litigation has been ongoing for a number of years.

 The requirement for EPMI to submit a balanced schedule is found in
the ISO tariff at section 2.2.7.2:

  A Scheduling Coordinator shall submit to the ISO only
Balanced Schedules in the Day-Ahead Market and the Hour-Ahead Market.  A
Schedule shall be treated as a Balanced Schedule when aggregate Generation,
Inter-Scheduling Coordinator Energy Trades (whether purchases or sales), and
imports or exports to or from external Control Areas adjusted for
Transmission Losses as appropriate, equals aggregate forecast Demand with
respect to all entities for which the Scheduling Coordinator schedules in
each zone.  If a Scheduling Coordinator submits a Schedule that is not a
Balanced Schedule, the ISO shall reject that Schedule provided that
Scheduling Coordinators shall have an opportunity to validate their
schedules prior to the deadline for submission to the ISO by requesting such
validation prior to the applicable deadline.

 The ISO Market Monitoring & Information Protocol ("MMIP") sets forth
the standards for Anomalous Market Behavior.  See MMIP 2.1.1.

  Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that
departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that
do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

  withholding Generation capacity under circumstances in which
it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

  unusual trades or transactions;

  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports form
or exports to other markets and exchanges.

 The MMIP also prohibits Gaming.  See MMIP 2.1.3.

  'Gaming,' or taking unfair advantage of the rules and
procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules,
or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial
Congestion, to the detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the
ISO Markets.  'Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other
conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation
capacity, such as loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or
seasonal limits on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors
that may otherwise render the system and the ISO Markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 The ISO MMIP allows the ISO to do any of the following, among other
things, as a result of an entity's Anomalous Market Behavior or Gaming:

* "impose such sanctions or penalties as it believes necessary and as
are permitted under the ISO Tariff."  See MMIP 7.3.

* refer "to such regulatory or antitrust agency as it sees fit to
recommend the imposition of sanctions and penalties."  See MMIP 7.3.

* publicize "in whatever medium it believes most appropriate" the
"activities or behavior of Market Participants in the ISO Markets [revealed
to] have the effect of, or potential for, undermining the efficiency,
workability or reliability of the ISO Markets to give or to serve such
Market Participants an unfair competitive advantage over other Market
Participants."  See MMIP 2.3.2.

Richard --

PG&E and SCE (along with TURN) filed at FERC seeking refunds.  As Seabron 
highlights below, I wouldn't put it pass them if they already have an idea of 
who to "charge" for this summer.

Last I remember, we were not too concerned about the utilities filing in 
state court seeking redress.  Given that the undercollection number is 
approaching $4 billion, I just want to make sure that we have thought about 
this angle.  The utilities are going to start trying to fix their problem in 
every way possible (I sure as hell would if I were them).

Mary and Jim:

Did you see in the PG&E/SCE filing that the two companies have kindly
volunteered (p. 32) to "assist the Commission in developing a full record
and in undertaking the rigorous analysis needed to fix the problems in the
California markets and determine refund responsibility". How kind and
public-spirited of them. More seriously, I would expect that they already
have a full economic analysis going on prices, damages, etc.

Subject:=09RE: Proposal re CalPX Methodologies

It seems to me that FERC's July 25 Order required Judge Birchman to make
findings about the exact amounts owed by each buyer to each seller.  The
proposal to establish methodologies does exactly that, among other things.
Therefore, it seems to me that it needs to be part of the the pending
California proceedings.

That is not to say, however, that it should not also be part of the
Chargeback proceedings under the April 6 FERC order.  It should also be
applicable to those proceedings.

Therefore, we need to develop a strategy to make it part of both
proceedings.  Timing is obviously critical, and I am soliciting the
Chargeback movants' views on that subject along with the substance of the
proposal.  I would like to point out that I have learned from the settlemen=
t
proceedings before Judge Wagner that we must submit the proposal early in
the proceedings to ensure that they are considered and can have an impact.

I sent an email to Ron Carroll letting him know that I am available for a
conference call at the following times:

Weds Aug 22 after 11 am Pacific time,
Thurs Aug 23 prior to 1 pm Pacific time,
Fri Aug 24 anytime except 1130 am to 2 pm Pacific time

Please let me know when we can discuss this further.  Thanks for your help.

Talked to a couple of people on this today.

Elena Schmid, ISO VP of Strategic SOmething, said that the ISO wants to know 
right away if the subpoena will be challenged in court.  If so, the ISO will 
not submit the info to the EOB.

I talked with Rob Lamkin, VP Southern, to see if he knoew anyone who planned 
to initiate a court challenge. He said he didn't.-- he said that Southern had 
sent a letter to the EOB and ISO yesterday, asking for an extension to the 
deadline and requesting a meeting to sit down and talk about how to maintain 
confidentiality. He said his attorneys believe that the EOB's subpoena 
authority is "questionable" but that Southern didn't want to have a fight 
about it in court.

On price caps, Rob also mentioned that he had heard that Greg Blue (Dynegy) 
was going around trying to get a group together to support a motion for $250 
!! He said that Richardson (DOE) told the WAPA Board member not to support a 
lower price cap. (but then, someone else told me the opposite -- I'll let you 
know if I hear more on that).

We still have Enron people working on four Board members to see if we can get 
one to turn.

Y'all:

FERC has requested (see attached letter) data similar to the data we have
been ordered to provide beginning 1/1/01 but for the refund period that
began on 10/1/01 (i.e., they need data for the front end of the refund
period: Oct-Dec). December is due March 30.  October and November due April
6. I am working with commercial attornies (Steve C Hall) and with traders
(Jeff Richter and others) to prepare a report.

We are ascertaining whether we can meet the March 30 deadline and may need
to request an extension.

An open question is the extent to which we need to submit transactions for
pricetaker bids.  Since Jan 1 we have only reported transactions where the
bid was above the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Using that criterion, we had no
transactions to report. There is also an open issue of how we report costs
since we are not generators.

Greetings:
As many of you are aware the EOB has filed a subpoena with the ISO requiring
them to provide confidential market data.
Jan knows that there may be people planning on filing an injunction of this
requirement and wanted to communicate that he thought this was a bad idea
and that there were other legal means to provide the protection you are
looking for to maintain the confidentially.
 If you have any questions regarding this please call Jan on his cell phone
at 916-296-8584.  If you are planning to file an injunction please call Jan
ASAP to let him know.
Thanks,
Katie Kaplan

Subject: FERC reports on Plant Closures in Callifornia and Northwest Prices 
in Nov & Dec

Good News.  FERC issued three reports yesterday:  a Response of the Staff of 
the FERC to Questions Posed at December 20, 2000 Western Governors 
Association Denver Meeting; a Staff Report to the FERC on Northwest Power 
Markets in Nov. and Dec. 2000; and a Report on Plant Outages in the State of 
California.  All three reports can be downloaded from FERC's page on bulk 
power markets, found at http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm. 

>From a quick scan of the pricing and outage reports, the results are very 
favorable.  FERC found no evidence that plants were down for other than 
maintenance or emissions problems.  The pricing report found that prices in 
the NW during the two months tracked the increased demand and supply 
shortfall.

Mary and Jim:

Did you see in the PG&E/SCE filing that the two companies have kindly
volunteered (p. 32) to "assist the Commission in developing a full record
and in undertaking the rigorous analysis needed to fix the problems in the
California markets and determine refund responsibility". How kind and
public-spirited of them. More seriously, I would expect that they already
have a full economic analysis going on prices, damages, etc.

Williams, Southern, Reliant and AES have filed motions to make the
protective order significantly stricter, and to stay the production of
documents until the protective order issues are resolved.  These generators
are taking a much harder line.  Counsel for Southern has advised me that
some of the generators may challenge a large part of the data request on
grounds of jurisdictional, burden, and trade secret intrusion.  It seems to
me that it may be best to let the generators fight for a stronger protective
order, and not take their side at this time.  We might well want to consider
proposing a "most favored nations clause" in our letter to the CPUC tomorrow
in order to take advantage of what ever tighter protective order is
eventually agreed to.  Generally, I feel the generators' stance will allow
us to be right where we want to be, not out front leading the charge, not
turning over everything right away, but instead making "just enough" of a
production to avoid being the center of attention.

I will forward the generators' pleadings to you as attachments to this
e-mail.  Gary, I believe, already has them.

We know that some generators, such as Reliant, are planning to turn over to
the CPUC most of the data being requested, after trying to obtain a more
restrictive protective order.  Many other parties are just beginning to
deal
with the process and are only at the stage of asking for two week
extensions.  We are trying to gather additional data about other retail
marketers.  Mike Day

Subject: SCE Motion for Supoena to MSC


On December, SCE filed a motion with FERC in which it request FERC to issue
a subpoena for the production of documentary evidence to the ISO's Market
Surveillance Committee.  The subpoena seeks information related to the
exercise of market power

While FERC's regulations allow 15 days to file an answer to motion, I
recommend that we file a response as soon as possible if this is something
that we either wish to oppose or have conditions established.

I an having a copy of the motion and subpoena faxed to you.  Ron

EOB Developments (Peter Meringolo)
On December 4, 2000, the Electricity Oversight Board ("EOB") issued a
subpoena to the ISO.  (The EOB previously issued a subpoena to the ISO on
July 20, 2000).  The 12/4/2000 subpoena seeks data related to, among other
things:  actual transmission flow; scheduled outages; out-of-sequence calls;
schedules, forecasts, and reserve information for Day Ahead and Hour Ahead;
Ancillary Service bids; and information related to BEEP calls.

 It is my understanding that Enron must inform the ISO on Monday,
December 11 whether or not it has any concerns with regard to
confidentiality.

 The Chief Counsel of the EOB has stated that it "will maintain the
confidentiality of individual market participant information that reflects
proprietary business practices and that has been identified as confidential
when submitted" to the EOB.  The EOB can disclose to the PUC and AG if they
agree to maintain confidentiality.

 This raises two questions:

 (1) Will the ISO be producing data that reflects Enron's
"proprietary business practices?"

 (2)  If so, who makes the confidentiality designation:  Enron or
ISO?  In other words, does Enron intend to rely on the ISO's confidentiality
designations, or should Enron seek an opportunity to review the data in
order to make its own decisions regarding confidentiality before the
production?

 To date, Enron has not objected to these requests from the various
agencies investigating the electricity market.  We believe the same strategy
should be followed here.  In other words, this does not appear to be a
battle worth fighting.

Calendar Dates

 Here is a summary of the immediate calendar dates:

12/4   Complaint Served
12/14  Last day for plaintiff to exercise preemptory challenge
12/14  Plaintiff may commence discovery by interrogatories, request for
production or    request for  admissions
12/26  First day for plaintiff to serve notice of deposition
1/3/01 Last Day to plead in response to complaint

Note: If Enron's first appearance is on 1/3/01, then the last date to file a
preemptory challenge for Enron will be within 10 days after first appearance
or 1/12/01.
1/29/01 Last day for plaintiff to serve complaint and file proof of servicre
4/30/01 Last day to hold case management conference.

Investigation Report Materials

They have been sent for Saturday delivery at the addresses indicated.

Thanks
Gary

That's a good point.  I think all of the data on the spreadsheet represents 
retail sales.  However, we have also been asked to provide data on wholesale 
transactions.  EES does about 95% of its wholesale business with EPMI.  What 
are your thoughts on disclosing data relevant to the 5% of the wholesale 
purchases that are not with EPMI?

Mike --

Before we send this in, I want to make sure that EES is submitting "retail" 
transactions clearly jurisidictional to the CPUC.  Your note says that EPMI 
will not be turning over similar wholesale data.

PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Mike and Sue--attached is the Excel spreadsheet of EES/EEMC trading info that 
we are considering turning over to the Cal PUC in response to the Subpoena.  
EPMI will not be turning over similar wholesale data, at least not at this 
point.

In that you have done much of the EES retail regulatory work in California, 
please let me know if you see any regulatory implications in turning over 
this info.  It seems to me that by doing so we would be at least tacitly 
admitting to the jurisdiction of the PUC to request and receive this info.  
By doing so, would we be undoing groundwork you have already laid?  Would we 
be jeopardizing our right to object to similar requests in the future?  Would 
we be opening any doors to more of this type of regulation?  My concern is 
that this info is innocuous and irrelevant now, but what about future 
requests for info that we do care about?

Also, what do the FERC info we learned on Friday and the new ISO price caps 
do to our response strategy?

Please respond asap--we need to be able to tell the PUC something in the next 
48 hours.  You can call me at 713 853 9503.  Thanks.  MDS

FYI.  Just so you know what we're saying in California.

The attached draft answers the California Municipal Utilities Association 
complaint that California markets are not workably competitive and therefore 
FERC should establish cost-based rates.  In its complaint, CMUA argued that 
the market isn't workably competitive because the prices were higher this 
summer than in previous years even in hours where demand was no higher.  
Seabron's paper shows that high prices have resulted from a number of 
unrelated structural and market design factors and increasing attempts at 
regulatory intervention.  He also debunks the assertions that cost-based 
rates will fix the problem in California and will be easily administered by 
FERC.  Our answer is due at FERC tomorrow so please get me your comments ASAP.

Steve,
	Here is the draft summary of Enron's ripple claims against
non-claimants (entities that are not seeking refunds in the PNW proceeding.)

	For illustrative purposes, we have used three different reference
prices:  (1) ISO; (2) Seattle; and (3) Tacoma.  We believe all three are
substantially flawed, but they give you a comparison to work with.  Please
let me know if you need more detail.

Davis to push backup diesel By Chris Bowman Bee Staff Writer (Published May=
 24, 2001)  In a major reversal of environmental policy, Gov. Gray Davis wi=
ll announce a plan to relieve California's overloaded electricity grid this=
 summer by paying businesses to run their high-polluting backup generators =
in advance of anticipated blackouts, a top energy adviser to the governor s=
aid Wednesday.  "The backup generators will help us get through the summer,=
" said S. David Freeman, who recently resigned as general manager of the Lo=
s Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis' drive for energy con=
servation.  Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of =
the plan.  "The governor will announce what he's going to do," he said Wedn=
esday in a wide-ranging interview on energy issues with The Bee.  Roger Sal=
azar, the governor's deputy press secretary, would not confirm when or whet=
her Davis would make such an announcement.  "I don't know that the governor=
 has signed off on anything like that," Salazar said.  Under the plan, part=
icipating businesses would turn on backup generators and simultaneously dis=
connect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage 3 -- nea=
rly depleted.  The state would pay the companies for the much-needed power =
that would be saved by converting to diesel generation.  Deploying diesel-p=
owered generators -- the dirtiest of internal combustion engines -- to fore=
stall blackouts is another sign of the governor's struggle to get more mega=
watts flowing through California.  Earlier this week Davis lowered his esti=
mate of the amount of new power that will come on line this summer from 5,0=
00 megawatts to 4,000 megawatts. A megawatt is enough power for 750 to 1,00=
0 households.  The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Da=
vis administration's policy.  The governor and his appointees at the state =
Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries,=
 utilities and the operator of the state's electricity grid, arguing that r=
outine use of the backup diesels would endanger public health.  San Diego G=
as & Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by the Davis=
-appointed state Public Utilities Commission.  Environmentalists who have b=
een catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter t=
he governor's repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards duri=
ng the energy crisis.  A letter signed Wednesday by several of the state's =
leading environmental organizations, including the American Lung Associatio=
n of California, urged Davis to reconsider.  "Given your awareness of the p=
ublic health threats of diesel emissions, please stop and have these propos=
als considered in a more thoughtful and public manner," the letter states. =
 Freeman argued, however, that the additional health threat from non-emerge=
ncy use of diesel generators is "marginal" compared with the health and saf=
ety problems triggered by power outages.  "This is a no-brainer," Freeman s=
aid. "You've got human lives at stake here. This is a scary situation."  Fr=
eeman cited, for example, people on life-support systems that could go awry=
 in blackouts.  But Sandra Spelliscy, attorney for the environmentalist Pla=
nning and Conservation League, countered, "If the health impacts are so mar=
ginal, why has the governor's own air quality enforcement agency opposed th=
is?"  Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data =
management centers have diesel-powered generators -- some the size of locom=
otives -- that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power.  Unlike=
 diesel-powered trucks and buses, most diesel standby generators run with l=
ittle or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergenci=
es.  Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently, most genera=
tors in use today produce about 500 times more emissions of smog-forming ni=
trogen oxides per megawatt-hour as a new natural gas-fired power plant, acc=
ording to air board engineers. Further, the diesels spew high amounts of br=
eathable soot particles that can cause cancer, the engineers say.  Davis' p=
lan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator de=
clares a Stage 3 alert, meaning the power supplies are running low and roll=
ing blackouts may be ordered to keep the state's entire grid from collapsin=
g, according to Freeman.  Salazar, the governor's spokesman, said only, "An=
y backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort =
to prevent blackouts."  Environmentalists who are trying to head off the pl=
an said it would have the state paying participating businesses at least 35=
 cents per kilowatt-hour, roughly three times the rate consumers typically =
pay for electricity. Freeman would not confirm the pay rate.  The Davis adm=
inistration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to=
 the state 50 percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need=
 to comply with smog rules.  For operators of existing power plants, the go=
vernor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above =
allowable limits in order to keep the lights on.  The latest plan to pay co=
mpanies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the e=
nvironmental reins.   The Bee's Chris Bowman can be reached at (916) 321-10=

Bush-Davis meeting set for energy crisis By David Whitney Bee Washington Bu=
reau (Published May 24, 2001)  WASHINGTON -- President Bush will meet next =
week with Gov. Gray Davis to talk about California's worsening electricity =
crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly =
favors some controls on West Coast wholesale electricity prices.  Details f=
or the Bush-Davis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday, but the fa=
ct that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor, w=
ho is often mentioned as a possible challenger in 2004, was seen as a sign =
that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issu=
e.  "California is a very big state," said White House spokesman Ari Fleisc=
her. "It represents one-sixth of the United States. It's the sixth-largest =
economy in the world. And the president is very pleased to sit and talk wit=
h Governor Davis. It's important."  Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said =
electricity price caps will be at the top of the governor's agenda for the =
meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. But Fleischer did not commit the president=
 to that kind of meeting.  In his first visit to the state since the campai=
gn last year, the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tues=
day night in Fresno.  Until now, the White House has steadfastly refused to=
 meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis des=
pite repeated pleas from the Democratic congressional delegation.  Price co=
ntrols have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and a hand=
ful of Republicans, but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them a=
s counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawatt-short st=
ate.  In recent weeks, however, there has been a developing shift in the at=
titude toward price controls on Capitol Hill. Bush's two nominees to the Fe=
deral Energy Regulatory Commission, whose names were forwarded to the Senat=
e floor Wednesday for confirmation, declined to rule out price controls onc=
e they are seated on the panel.  And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen. =
James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in contr=
ol of the Senate, moving Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a price-control =
advocate, to the helm of the key Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commit=
tee.  California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a committee Democrat, said Wednesda=
y that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legis=
lation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production.  Four=
 Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of p=
rice-control legislation.  On Wednesday, Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, annou=
nced that he is introducing a bill that, while not technically a price cap,=
 would give greater price relief for West Coast consumers than federal regu=
lators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer.  Ose, chairma=
n of the House Government Reform Committee's energy subcommittee, said his =
bill would extend throughout the West a price-mitigation plan approved last=
 month by the FERC. But instead of that plan taking effect only during powe=
r emergencies as the commission directed, it would operate around the clock=
 under Ose's bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of th=
e least-efficient plant selling into the California market.  Ose said his b=
ill would encourage generators to sell their power through long-term contra=
cts rather than on the volatile spot market.  "I am looking for a middle gr=
ound," Ose said.   The Bee's David Whitney can be reached at (202) 383-0004=

Energy Digest: GOP unveils plan to help utility By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol =
Bureau (Published May 24, 2001)  State Assembly efforts to develop a bipart=
isan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and =
avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan =
of their own.  The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and v=
ote along party lines on an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $2.76 =
billion state purchase of power lines.  Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox=
 of Fair Oaks said Wednesday's split was necessary because there are few di=
fferences between the governor's plan and the Democrats' plan.  The Republi=
can plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectr=
ic facilities.  Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer ra=
tes to allow Edison to pay off $3.5 billion in debts. In return, ratepayers=
 would receive either an equity stake in future power plants or the right t=
o purchase electricity at discount rates.=09








Few escape blame for crisis in poll By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau =
Chief (Published May 24, 2001)  Utility companies and out-of-state power ge=
nerators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in Californ=
ia's energy crisis, but Gov. Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically o=
ver the past five months, according to a Field Poll released Wednesday.  An=
d Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's power =
woes -- except themselves.  Every player in the power drama gets poor marks=
 except "residential energy consumers," which 39 percent of poll respondent=
s say are doing a good or very good job to improve the energy situation. On=
ly 22 percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job.  Public opinion=
 of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January, when 32 perc=
ent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave them high m=
arks.  "The public sees themselves as conserving energy," said Field Poll D=
irector Mark DiCamillo. "That's the only positive movement in the survey." =
 For Davis, who faces re-election next year, the movement is far from posit=
ive.  In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from=
 41 percent of those surveyed, average grades from 31 percent and poor rati=
ngs from only 22 percent.  But when the Field Institute conducted its recen=
t poll between May 11 and Sunday, opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After =
months of energy angst, a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases=
, only 27 percent think Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave hi=
m failing grades. The poll also shows that Californians believe the crisis =
will continue by an average of a year and a half, well through the upcoming=
 re-election battle.  "All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effec=
t early on is not going over well any more," DiCamillo said. "The public is=
 starting to view this as a long-term problem, not some temporary policy sh=
ift."  Still, Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- =
President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry.  The pu=
blic's view of energy interests, which was pretty dim in January, drops eve=
n lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from half t=
he public in January, but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or v=
ery poor job. Out-of-state energy generators, whom Davis has accused of gou=
ging ratepayers, fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 percent =
in the May poll.  Bush, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the st=
ate Public Utilities Commission are not far behind, drawing poor grades fro=
m more than half the public. Cheney, the architect of Bush's energy proposa=
l, received low ratings from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask=
 about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office.  Davis has re=
peatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity, =
and has called Cheney "grossly misinformed" on the state's energy problems.=
 Cheney, in turn, has called Davis' energy proposals "harebrained" and "goo=
fy."  The state Legislature receives poor marks from 41 percent of those po=
lled, while only 16 percent believe it is doing a good job.   The Bee's Dan=

        New views emerging on power More elected officials support the conc=
ept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau  (Published May 23=
, 2001)  If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least k=
now when to break out the candles or send the workers home.  That's the gro=
wing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including Gov. Gray Davi=
s, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving business=
es and residents ample warning.  On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's offi=
ce said Davis supports longer public notice than the 24 hours called for un=
der a proposal by the California Independent System Operator, which runs th=
e state's power grid.  Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill=
 that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could ma=
ke plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all oth=
er days the lights would stay on.  Briggs called his plan an improvement on=
 the existing system in which "every day is a potential blackout day."  A S=
enate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a strate=
gy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state=
 will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask Washing=
ton and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel."  If the power genera=
tors refused to sell at the lower prices, the state would gut it out with p=
lanned blackouts.  "Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michae=
l Shames, head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, to=
ld the Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. But Shames and other=
s stressed the need for warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no long=
er than 90 minutes.  "Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how=
 the buyers' cartel could work," Shames said.  On a visit to Chicago on Mon=
day, Davis said he talked to officials about the city's system for giving t=
he public warning days before possible power blackouts, with definite notic=
e right before.  "There is no reason to keep that secret from the public wh=
en their safety is likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday.=
 The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at I=
SO to explore the idea of a system like Chicago's.  The grid operator annou=
nced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a half-hour notice=
 of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more war=
ning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will go beyond ISO's.  There are=
 potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking advantage=
 of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts might inc=
rease the number of outages.  If people have been warned that a blackout is=
 coming, and a last-minute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid=
 managers would have to decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothroc=
k, vice president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=
  If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possi=
bly leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.  "Obviously, there are tra=
de-offs," Rothrock said.  Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be=
 gaining ground as a way for the state to get back some control of the ener=
gy crisis, sorely lacking in recent months.  "It would help us as Californi=
ans to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush, we're going to handle this our=
selves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove.  Overman said he has been bu=
rning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone who will listen that sch=
eduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier.  Briggs said he has bee=
n told by constituents, including irrigators and food processors, that sche=
duled blackouts are the way to go.  Irrigators would know that they shouldn=
't plan on getting water on a day that their electronic gates might be clos=
ed.  Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arran=
ge for backup power generators, he said.  "We would be very interested in i=
t," said Ed Yates, senior vice president of the California League of Food P=
rocessors.  Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, =
requiring some plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for =
more than a day.  Some processors might choose to close on days when they f=
aced a blackout, he said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands=
 of pounds of food.  "It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a v=
ery difficult situation," he said.  Briggs said that his plan would result =
in possible blackout days every two weeks. The plan would assume that a cer=
tain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operatin=
g. If the electricity shortage went above that amount, people might still f=
ace unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.  One question is public safety. S=
ome are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur. But pluses=
 include the ability to arrange for temporary stop signs at road intersecti=
ons, or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved.  "I=
f the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult int=
ersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departments =
and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said.  The manufacturers' =
association and other business groups haven't endorsed the idea yet, but sa=
y it's worth a look.  "It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothr=
ock said.  The Bee's John Hill can be reached at (916) 326-5543 or jhill@sa=

        Californians' priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a F=
ield Poll * Related graphic   By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief =
 (Published May 23, 2001)  Californians have some clear ideas on how to sol=
ve the energy crisis: build more nuclear power plants, cap the wholesale pr=
ice of electricity and relax air-quality standards to allow older plants to=
 be upgraded.  And, according to a Field Poll released Tuesday, they're not=
 so hot on the recently approved $13.4 billion bond authorization to pay fo=
r electricity, or the idea of Gov. Gray Davis seizing power plants through =
eminent domain.  Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by =
respondents' unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes =
of the state's power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an arti=
ficial crisis created by power companies to make money.  But on one longsta=
nding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear preference and a dr=
amatic shift in public opinion.  In the highest recorded support for nuclea=
r power in California since before the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, =
59 percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide elect=
ricity.  Support among registered voters grows to 61 percent, with 33 perce=
nt opposed. Among Democrats, 53 percent support more nuclear plants, and th=
ree-fourths of Republicans and 55 percent of others agree.  "The change in =
attitude is very significant because they know this issue," Field Poll Dire=
ctor Mark DiCamillo said.  Californians' support for nuclear power reached =
nearly 70 percent in the mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy =
crisis. But it plummeted to 37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown a=
t Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island plant and fell to 33 percent in 1984 -- =
the last time Field surveyed the question.  In 1989, voters demanded that t=
he Sacramento Municipal Utility District's Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shu=
t down. The utility complied and has spent more than $200 million decommiss=
ioning it during the past 12 years.  Although the poll results are in line =
with some private surveys done recently by nuclear-energy advocates, oppone=

        Offshore drilling waits in the wings   (Published May 23, 2001)  WA=

Bush, Davis to meet, discuss state's energy crisis =09



By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  May 23, 2001  WASHINGTON - After weeks=
 of holding California and its electricity crisis at arm's length, Presiden=
t Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a two-day visit to the=
 state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov. Gray=
 Davis.  White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday=
 that the state's energy crisis will be "at the top of the list" when the p=
resident and the governor meet. The president's aides said that the time an=
d place for the meeting are still being worked out.  Bush's visit to the st=
ate will be his first since last fall's campaign. With their party enjoying=
 only a slim majority in the U.S. House, some California Republicans have e=
xpressed dismay over their state's absence from the president's extensive p=
ost-inaugural travel schedule, fearing that the energy crisis could cost so=
me GOP lawmakers their seats in next year's elections. =09



Fleischer's announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas=
is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no h=
int until then that the president would address the issue during his upcomi=
ng trip to California.  However, Davis called the White House on Tuesday ni=
ght proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy. =
 He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quick=
er action on the energy front: "Californians can't afford to wait four or f=
ive years for a permanent solution. We need relief today."  In the longer o=
f two letters, Davis wrote: "You and I don't agree on everything. But here'=
s something we do have in common: we both inherited an energy mess. And the=
 people that elected us expect us to clean it up."  Davis also offered in t=
he letters to "introduce" Bush to "business owners and everyday citizens wh=
o have been personally affected by this energy crisis."  Fleischer said Wed=
nesday that Bush would meet with "business leaders and energy consumers."  =
Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis, Fleischer suggested the preside=
nt's schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis' suggestions.  "This=
 is a case of they both want to meet with each other, and we're very please=
d to be able to make it work out," he said.  As for the meeting with the bu=
siness leaders, Fleischer said, "The president has several events on his sc=
hedule that already include business leaders and energy consumers, and so i=
t very well may happen that we're each suggesting similar things, which wou=
ld be a healthy sign."  Bush's itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at=
 the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base designed to showcase his order direct=
ing the military to cut their energy use by 10 percent at California facili=
ties.  Fleischer said that the president wanted "to talk about how the fede=
ral government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California i=
n the cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as=
 they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are mo=
st at risk."  The White House released an outline of the president's Califo=
rnia itinerary on Tuesday afternoon. It indicated that the visit would not =
give prominent attention to the state's energy woes.  Fleischer declined to=
 say whether the president would expand on his energy plan in any way while=
 in California.  Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply cri=
tical of the Bush administration for failing to take decisive action to hel=
p alleviate the electricity shortage's toll on the state and its citizens. =
 They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before =
the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in=
 the state. The administration and most of the state's Republican lawmakers=
 oppose the measure.  Last week, Bush showcased an administration task forc=
e report on the nation's energy challenges that stressed long-range solutio=
ns focused mainly on increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded =
role for nuclear power. The report also suggested incentives to encourage e=
nergy conservation and greater fuel efficiency.  Bush's trip will begin on =
Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in Arizona to Los Angeles wh=
ere he will spend the night. He will return to Washington on Wednesday nigh=
t after a visit to the Fresno area.  Bush assumed office despite losing the=
 nation's most populous state by a decisive margin and then launched into t=

California Democrats seek price caps on electricity

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE=20
May 22, 2001=20
WASHINGTON - Accusing power generators of price gouging, a group of Califor=
nia House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislate price=
 caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state.=20
Rep. Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the price-cap measu=
re, said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday. At that ti=
me the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bill=
 designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this sum=
mer due to shortages in the supply of electrical power.=20
Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fund-raising events on Mond=
ay and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney, c=
harging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situ=
ation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campai=
gn contributions.=20
"This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection =
laws," Waxman said. "It is a contrived crisis in order to produce 1000 perc=
ent increases in profits for some of these generators."=20
On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep. Joe =
Barton, R-Texas, that would allow California Gov. Gray Davis to temporarily=
 waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state =
when blackouts are imminent.=20
It also would include:=20
  federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valle=
y;=20
  mandated power savings at federal facilities;=20
  state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time;=20
  an easing of the ties of some small, independent power generators to larg=
e utilities.=20
Earlier this month, a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxman's pric=
e-cap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of =
limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve=
 California's crisis.=20
The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps, saying t=
hat such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity sh=
ortage in California and many other western states by discouraging explorat=
ion and production.=20
Waxman's plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa=
le power rates to production costs, plus a "reasonable" profit.=20
At the press conference, Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, derided Republican o=
pposition to price caps.=20
Referring to wholesale power generators, Filner argued, "They were making m=
oney at $30 a megawatt; now they are charging up to $2,000. Believe me: The=
y can make money off the market with a cost-base rate. They have done it fo=
r 100 years. They can continue doing it."=20
Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, said that California Republicans on the =
energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from p=
arty leaders to oppose the price-cap bill.=20
"There are no party affiliations for rate payers," said Harman, a committee=
 member. "Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rat=
es in California."=20






Mexico: No limit on number of new plants to be built =09
=09




Energy chief says 'anyone who requests a permit will get it' By Diane Lindq=
uist  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  May 22, 2001  Mexican Energy Secretary Er=
nesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't set any limit on the number =
of power plants in Baja California supplying electricity north of the borde=
r.  "Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in Cali=
fornia for electricity, anyone who requests a permit will get it," Martens =
said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin Ame=
rican Energy Conference in La Jolla.  Power plant construction in Baja Cali=
fornia has become one of the most immediate solutions to California's elect=
ricity shortfalls. At least three plants being built in Baja California in =
the next four years will send electricity north of the border, where blacko=
uts have interrupted normal activity.  One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. =
power plant near Mexicali, will export all of its electrical output to cons=
umers north of the border. The San Diego company's project gained quick app=
roval from Mexican authorities because the facility is not subject to restr=
ictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican=
 market.  Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprise=
s are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California.  Such a=
 mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border t=
hat the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public h=
ealth and safety.  In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to=
 preserving the environment and local communities.  But afterward, he said =
Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve Califor=
nia consumers.  "I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of th=
e interconnecting lines to transmit the electricity that is produced," he s=
aid.  With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission inte=
rconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja Californi=
a will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of electricity fo=
r the California market produced by the new Baja California plants -- let a=
lone any additional facilities.  Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric sub=
sidiary owns both the interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconn=
ector near Mexicali, spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvemen=
t will transmit electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the c=
ompany substation in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego =
and Tijuana.  Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building B=
aja California plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives o=
f the firms could not be reached yesterday.  Even if the companies find a w=
ay to send electricity across the border, the California grid system presen=
ts another obstacle.  To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the=
 Southern California grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing wh=
at capacity it has for transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess=
 tariffs for the service.  "It's become very important because of our proxi=
mity to Mexico," said district spokesman Ron Hull.  The ability to transmit=
 electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja Californ=
ia. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities.  Sempra again is=
 a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that wi=
ll supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja Califor=
nia and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The pipeline won't provi=
de fuel for any other facilities.  "It's fully subscribed," said Clark. "In=
 the future if there is enough demand, the compression could be increased."=
  Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natur=
al gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural =
gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada.  While several c=
ompanies have expressed an interest in such an operation, Martens' comments=
 were the first to indicate that two, and not one, might be approved for Ba=
ja California. =09

Over the past four months, Californians have developed increasingly negativ=

A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas & Electr=
ic's bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provi=
de service to its customers.=20
Fifty-seven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute, a Sa=
n Francisco-based nonpartisan polling organization, gave California's priva=
te electric utilities a poor rating. That's more than the 40 percent of res=
pondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January.=20
The same negative feelings held true for out-of-state energy providers. Fif=
ty-five percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poor, =
a noticeable increase from the 44 percent of respondents who gave them a po=
or rating in January.=20
Specifically, those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by offic=
ials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state.=20
The poll found that:=20
* The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Comm=
ission a poor rating rose from 42 percent in January to 52 percent in May.=
=20
* 41 percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in =

* 38 percent gave Gov. Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of =
the state's energy woes, a sharp increase from 22 percent who gave him a po=

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from re=
spondents. In May, 52 percent said FERC was doing a poor job, as opposed to=
 40 percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January.=20
Those surveyed were also asked if PG&E's bankruptcy would make it more diff=

What we need to do is tune in, turn off and drop out.=20
Tune in to how you use energy. Turn off those things that use electricity. =
And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and alter=
natives to power sources.=20
That's the only thing we can do in the short term.=20
In the long term, you can almost see what will be coming down the pike.=20
As the state's energy problems worsen, as the state throws its surplus down=
 a rathole, as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across=
 the state, someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on =
the ballot.=20
It will do two things.=20
First, it will undo the deregulation of the state's energy industry. It wil=
l try to put everything back the way it was.=20
Second, it will punish the producers of power and energy.=20
It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ=
ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirel=
y.=20
Huge amounts of money will be spent against it. Opponents will outspend sup=
porters by a substantial amount.=20
TV ads will run constantly, predicting dire consequences if the initiative =
is approved.=20
We'll be told it will be bad for business. Labor leaders will tell us that =
it will cost jobs. Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem, =
or make the problem worse.=20
All of that will probably be true.=20
The initiative will pass easily.=20
It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a=
s the two main causes of the current energy crisis -- a badly bungled dereg=
ulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers.=20
It will pass because the initiative's authors will understand that most of =
us are furious about the way this mess was created and that we're eager to =
take it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains.=20
It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldn't=
 are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place, and we wo=
n't believe them.=20
It's much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate =
political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo=
r the problem -- such as the state Legislature and Gov. Davis, who could ha=
ve done something about this a year ago and chose not to.=20
Yes, the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi=
s and the Legislature.=20
But elections for office are not yes/no propositions -- you don't get to vo=
te up or down on Davis.=20
They are a contest between two major party candidates, which means election=
s are always a matter of comparisons -- Davis compared with his opponent. S=
omeone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bette=
r than Davis.=20
There might, indeed, be such people. It's unlikely one of those people will=
 appear on the ballot in 2002, however.=20
The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in disco=
uragement -- people who, fearful of losing, lack the nerve to run against a=
 well-financed incumbent.=20
The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that pr=
oblem -- rather than being stuck with a well-financed incumbent, we'd force=
 him out of office.=20
In reality, we're stuck with the well-financed incumbent until his term lim=
its are up -- in six or eight years.=20
That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to ei=
ght years. It has done nothing to embolden would-be candidates. Now, they j=
ust meekly wait their turn.=20
And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Cap=
itol with people who don't know what they're doing, only where they're goin=
g next. Meanwhile, the people who do know what they're doing have been kick=
ed out office.=20
It's no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu=
ll of people elected during the term-limit era.=20
A statewide initiative, brave candidates, ending term limits -- those are a=
ll things that will happen in the future.=20
Right now, it's time to tune in, turn off and drop out.=20
Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer -- cast a critical =
eye at your own habits.=20
Turn off your appliances, your lights, your air conditioner and reduce your=
 individual energy consumption. It's much easier than it appears.=20
Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by swit=
ching off some lights, converting to fluorescent light bulbs, turning down =
the refrigerator and connecting some appliances to a power strip, so that t=
hey truly are turned off.=20
Finally, drop out of the power grid. Look for other ways to power your home=
 -- most notably solar power, which is readily available.=20

I live in Sacramento, where we do use air-conditioning in the summer. I cov=
ered two skylights with aluminum foil to keep the heat out. Two east- facin=
g windows have exterior roll-up blinds. . . . I adjusted my pool pump from =
six hours per day to two hours from 6 to 8 a.m. This saves electricity and =
puts the usage in the morning, which is not the peak usage. I keep my compu=
ter power strip and music/VCR power strip switched off. This alone saves ab=
out one kilowatt hour per day. I replaced four of my most used lights with =
fluorescent bulbs. You really don't need to change all of your bulbs, just =

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring=
 that Californians be given at least one hour's notice before blackouts hit=
, according to a top administration official.=20
The one-hour notice is double what the California Independent System Operat=
or, managers of the state's electrical grid, proposed earlier this week. Th=
e ISO board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today.=20
Details of Davis' plan were still being worked out, said the administration=
 official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But any plan would have=
 to order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts.=20
Davis also hopes to give 48-hour and then 24-hour notices of probable black=
out scenarios. Administration officials said the two-day notice would go to=
 law enforcement, while everyone would get a 24-hour warning.=20
Business groups welcomed the executive order.=20
"We need to plan, we need to make adjustments in business schedules," said =
Jeanne Cain, vice president for government relations for the California Cha=
mber of Commerce. "There are concerns about employee safety issues. The mor=
e notice we have, the better we can accommodate the blackout."=20
Carl Guardino, an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manu=
facturing Group, has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and wor=
king with the governor.=20
"Sixty minutes is twice as good" as 30 minutes, he said.=20
With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer, lawmakers have been =
searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses.=20
"As much notice as possible would be helpful. It's helpful to have some adv=
ance notice for planning purposes, but small businesses will still be hurt =
by the blackouts," said Shirley Knight, assistant state director of the Nat=
ional Federation of Independent Business.=20
"Most small businesses are in the service sector so they're open during the=
 day, which means small-business owners aren't going to be able to recoup t=
hose blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to," Knight said.=20
But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackout=
s from happening in the first place.=20
"It's like saying you're going to know a half hour earlier that an earthqua=
ke is coming," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=
 Rights. "We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy gene=
rators, rather than giving us an extra 30 minutes."=20
'POWER WATCH'=20
The Independent System Operator's proposed plan for forecasting potential b=
lackouts envisions a system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high- de=
mand days. A "Power Watch" would be declared whenever a Stage 1 or Stage 2 =
alert is likely, while a "Power Warning" would be issued whenever there is =
at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage 3 alert, when electricity reserves =
drop below 1.5 percent.=20
Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning =
of blackouts, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a=
 chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it would welcome the advance notice to be=
 able to notify customers who rely on electricity for life-critical equipme=
nt and large businesses.=20
"We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate =
to customers about pending rotating outages," said Ron Low, a spokesman for=
=20
PG&E.
The public safety aspect must be taken into account, said one consumer grou=
p.=20
"Blackouts have serious consequences, not just economic," said Mindy Spatt,=
 spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "They create =
public safety hazards, and all of those issues cannot be addressed from war=
nings. But knowing in advance is better."=20
E-MAIL ALERTS
The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most c=
urrent information about how much electricity is being used and how much is=
 available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that =
information can be sent in an hourly e-mail.=20
This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan=
 their operations.=20
Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Here's some advice from PG&E a=
nd local utilities about how to prepare for blackouts:=20
-- Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light=
 candles, observe the usual safety precautions.=20
-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if your home alo=
ne is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in whi=
ch case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau.=20
-- Unplug or turn off all appliances, TVs and computers. Leave one light on=
 to warn you when the power comes back on.=20
-- When the power returns, turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power=
 surges.=20
-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can sen=
d a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power work=
ers.=20
-- Don't open your refrigerator, so your food will remain cold.=20
-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, turn off the TV and com=
puters and not to use candles.=20

Californians angry across the board in energy crisis=20

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has hand=
led the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their energy =
doghouse, a Field Poll shows.=20
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush =
and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey.=20
"Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings=
" when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are ha=
ndling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the F=
ield Poll.=20
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent rating=
s skidding for anyone connected with the energy business.=20
"Everyone has gotten tarred," DiCamillo said.=20
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric =
Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or ve=
ry poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers rank=
ed almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very p=
oor category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis=
sion to the same level.=20
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked w=
ith the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are supp=
orted by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said.=20
"To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue=
, " he said, "I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather disma=
l."=20
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect=
 the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are indi=
cations that that strategy may not work forever.=20
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job =
with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new=
 survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jum=
ped to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January.=20
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It=
 has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.=20
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their =
own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe=
 residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding =
to the problem, up from 26 percent in January.=20
"People think they're making an effort to conserve," DiCamillo said. "In th=
e public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be do=
ing."=20
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousne=
ss of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or =
more before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced=
 it will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity.=
=20
"The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for=
 a long haul," DiCamillo said. "The state hasn't been able to fix the probl=
em in a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen."=20
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that =
PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to =
its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if busines=
ses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts.=20
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state, Di=
Camillo said.=20
"This is recognized as a major statewide issue," he said. "People think it =
will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live."=20

House panel calls off vote on Calif power bill WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The =
U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee has called off, at least temporarily, a =
vote on legislation to aid California and other states during this summer's=
 expected electricity shortage.  Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republica=
n chairman of the committee, said lawmakers needed more time to seek a bipa=
rtisan deal to get agreement on immediate help for power-starved California=
 and the West.  ``We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreeme=
nt,'' Tauzin said.  He hoped that talks on Thursday would allow a vote on t=
he pending legislation as early as today.  The legislation was written by R=
epublicans to reduce demand and encourage more supply of power in Californi=
a this summer. Many Democrats on the committee objected to the bill, saying=
 it needed a provision to cap wholesale prices in the entire Western region=
 or else it fails to help the situation.  Republican lawmakers, along with =
the Bush administration, strongly oppose price controls.=09








Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism LOS ANGE=
LES (AP) -- California would get a little power and a lot of pollution from=
 a proposal being considered by Gov. Gray Davis that would pay owners of ba=
ckup generators to produce electricity.  The proposal, one of several optio=
ns the governor is considering, would pay for diesel power -- which at its =
dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than the cleanest natural gas power pl=
ants -- when electricity supplies are stretched.  ``If backup generators we=
re to be used, it would only be as a last resort to avoid blackouts,'' said=
 Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ``Unfortunately, we are in an emergency sit=
uation. Everything is on the table.''  California's persistent power shorta=
ge has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year, w=
ith more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air cond=
itioning.  If all of the state's backup generators ran full time, they woul=
d produce about 425 tons of nitrogen dioxide per day. That's more than nine=
 times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999, accor=
ding to state Air Resources Board data.  And the state would get only about=
 550 megawatts of electricity -- barely 1 percent of the state's peak power=
 needs -- from the backup generators. That would be enough to power about 5=
50,000 homes.  ``They could have a huge negative effect on air quality,'' s=
aid Ellen Garvey, executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management=
 Agency. ``It's one thing to run these generators during blackouts and emer=
gency conditions, but using them for other purposes could be devastating.''=
  Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Proc=
essors, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Die=
go Gas & Electric.  ``These generators could go a long way to taking some d=
emand off the electric grid and putting some supply back into the power sys=
tem,'' said Gino DiCaro, spokesman for the manufacturers and technology ass=
ociation.  Most of the state's 17,200 backup generators are small units tha=
t run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls. Some are rentals, and oth=
ers can be found at hospitals, office buildings, sewage treatment plants an=
d university labs.  Unlike backup generators intended for home use, which a=
re not regulated, industrial-sized units are limited in the number of hours=
 they can operate. But since the state's power crunch began, regional air-q=
uality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more fre=
quently.  Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen -=
- a building block of asthma-inducing smog.=09










   Small generators fight for payment from utilities  Posted at 11:24 p.m. =
PDT Wednesday, May 23, 2001  BY JENNIFER BJORHUS   Mercury News    BAKERSFI=
ELD -- A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy, a small =
natural gas-fired power plant on the city's gritty northeast edge. The clam=
or of machinery and trucks -- sounds that meant prosperity here -- is gone.=
 Employees have painted Oildale's machinery, insulated the boilers and twea=
ked the motionless 13-ton turbine.  Now they wait.  ``It's kind of like a s=
keleton,'' says plant manager Mike Pankratz, surveying the octopus-tangle o=
f pipes and tanks.  Choked by the $10 million Pacific Gas & Electric Co. ow=
es it, Oildale shut down Feb. 6, taking its 40 megawatts of badly needed el=
ectricity with it. The hush here is the sound of small generators locked in=
 one of the most serious issues of California's energy crisis -- one that s=
tate regulators plan to wrestle with today.  Oildale is part of a growing l=
egion of small generators, from geothermal to gas-fired co-generation plant=
s, battling California's utilities and state price controls they say are cr=
ippling them. These small generators, owed about $1.5 billion, supply up to=
 a third of California's electricity.  At least 25 have sued Southern Calif=
ornia Edison over unpaid bills. Four have sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy =
proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least 19 smal=
l generators, including Oildale. In many cases, these companies want to end=
 their long-term supply contracts with the utilities so they can sell their=
 electricity on the more lucrative open market.  ``What this is, basically,=
 is the revolt of the mice,'' said Bill Short with Ridgewood Power Manageme=
nt, a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gas-fired generators in Cali=
fornia and sued PG&E.  Officials to weigh debt  The companies are hoping fo=
r action from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is schedule=
d today to weigh whether to order the utilities to pay the back debt. Meanw=
hile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by d=
isgruntled generators and counter motions from PG&E.  The deteriorating fin=
ances of some of the approximately 690 small generators threatens Californi=
a's fragile power supply just as the state heads into the summer months up =
to 3,700 megawatts short.  The deep and often unexpected economic impacts o=
f California's energy crunch add up daily. In Oildale's case, the shutdown =
not only jeopardizes the jobs of its 10 anxious employees, but those of mor=
e than 150 employees at the refinery next door.  It's one of the biggest pu=
blic policy botches in the energy crisis, some energy experts argue. Califo=
rnia is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clea=
n and efficient small power suppliers in its own back yard, they say. Gas-f=
ired co-generation plants, which provide power to nearby businesses and sel=
l electricity to utilities, are some of the most efficient producers in the=
 state. And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like t=
he sun and garbage fumes, lessening the state's dependence on high-priced n=
atural gas.  ``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while =
we're paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else=
, this is just nuts,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University =
of California Energy Institute, mentioning companies that own major power p=
lants in the state. ``This is really a major blunder.''  The immediate cris=
is started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained. That's when PG&E =
told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in Decembe=
r. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz said, which halted the=
 plant's supply.  Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine.  The move socked=
 Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over Oildale. Unable =
to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies, Golden Bear canno=
t heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces. Golden Bear filed for b=
ankruptcy April 23. Last week it announced plans to lay off 172 employees. =
 Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale, Golden Bear's exclusive =
source of steam heat for nearly 20 years, was a key reason his group bought=
 the refinery four years ago. Having it go under was ``gut-wrenching,'' he =
said.  Power unavailable  The California Independent System Operator, keepe=
r of the state's electricity grid, reports that 1,400 megawatts of power fr=
om small generators are off line. It estimates that about half of that -- 7=
00 megawatts, or energy for as many as 700,000 homes -- is due to the finan=
cial squeeze of natural gas prices, money owed by the utilities or both. Ot=
hers say financial problems have 1,100 megawatts off line.  Lawmakers haven=
't been much help. The state Assembly on March 22 rejected a hastily crafte=
d rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies. The issue has languis=
hed in Sacramento.  Days later, the utilities commission ordered California=
's utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future =
-- which saved many of them -- but it did not order the utilities to pay th=
e hefty back-due amounts. It also set a new rate for what utilities should =
pay the generators for electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too =
low for business, some argue.  The commission's position has been that the =
small generators should abide by their existing contracts, said commission =
attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the extent that some of them are facing financial=
 hardship, the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to =
help them vis-a-vis the back debt.''  The lack of stronger action to suppor=
t these generators baffles some critics.  ``It's like talking to a starving=
 man on a desert island and saying, `How long can you hold up until the shi=
p comes?' '' said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficien=
cy and Renewable Technologies.  Some of the companies have appealed to the =
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but regulators are waiting to see if =
the state and the courts can resolve the issue.  ``We're in what essentiall=
y amounts to an abusive relationship,'' said Short with Ridgewood, the inde=

      Electricity notebook  FERC may renew price caps  May 24, 2001  From R=
egister wire services  Federal regulators this week announced that they mig=
ht reimpose caps on the cost of transporting natural gas into southern Cali=
fornia.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the publi=
c 20 days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps, which were tem=
porarily suspended by the commission this year. The price controls were lif=
ted in an effort to expand the reach of deregulation.  This proposed action=
, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., "could make a real difference."  "S=
ince FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap, the price of nat=

thern California is $12.59 per million British Thermal Units and only $3.70=
 in the rest of the Western region. Gas fuels most electricity-generating p=

      Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison  Davis' tack is politicall=
y volatile. The aim still is to steer clear of bankruptcy.  May 24, 2001  B=
y HANH KIM QUACH  and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register  SACRAMENTO Law=
makers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov. Gray Davis made to rescue =
the state's No. 2 utility from financial ruin with something more political=
ly palatable.  Davis' deal, some have complained, is sweeter for Southern C=
alifornia Edison than for taxpayers. So at least four proposals are being f=
loated to supplant that plan. But legislators are far from a consensus on a=
ny of them. Plans emerge, recede and are reconfigured daily.  Energy expert=
s and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling could resu=
lt in what neither side wants: bankruptcy for Edison.  Bankruptcy means the=
 state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and Pacific Gas & Ele=
ctric - which is already in bankruptcy - complete the Chapter 11 process, w=
hich could take years, experts and lawmakers said.  The state's wallet woul=
d shrink, affecting its ability to build schools and roads. Ratepayers migh=
t be on the hook for an additional $1 billion for the company's legal fees,=
 because bankruptcy would freeze its assets, said Brian Bennett, vice presi=
dent of Edison International, the utility's parent company.  Southern Calif=
ornia Edison has said it's willing to be flexible on the governor's plan, w=
hich calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission grid for $2.76 billio=
n. Company officials wouldn't comment on the various alternatives.  "We und=
erstand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are op=
en to variations on it,'' Bennett said.  Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, =
said the governor also remained committed to his deal.  "Edison is going to=
 survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Public Utilities Commiss=
ion from 1986 through 1991 and a past president of the agency. But the ques=
tion is "whether it will survive via the (plan) that the governor negotiate=
d or they do the same kind of thing PG&E did."  "There is still a very real=
 risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers to=
o much with the deal, or fails to move ahead promptly,'' Wilk said.  PG&E c=
hose to file Chapter 11 last month because it was dissatisfied with the pro=
gress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company. PG&E's m=
ove was an embarrassment for Davis, who had vowed to keep the state's big u=
tilities solvent.  "One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is=
 not filing for bankruptcy,'' said Ed Feo, a lawyer involved with the PG&E =
case. "It would be a black eye for the state. As long as the company stays =
out of bankruptcy, they have something to trade."  Edison's creditors are s=
till waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature. Some have a=
greed to defer receiving payments until the end of June.  Dean Vanech, pres=
ident of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot of things need to=
 happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison into bankru=
ptcy.  "In general, we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope=
 in a deal being made,'' Vanech said. But, he admitted, "there's a concern =
that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of =
time.''Meanwhile, Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve =
the transmission deal. The company has launched a public-relations campaign=
 to persuade the public that it is in its interest, said John Bryson, chief=
 executive of Edison International.  "Bankruptcy is a last resort,'' Bryson=
 said in a recent interview. "We believe there will be a solution.''  But c=
hanges are necessary, said Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, "bec=
ause people didn't like Plan A.''  Lawmakers cringed at some elements of th=
e plan, which many thought was overly generous to Edison: limiting investig=
ation of the utility's parent's company and guaranteeing the company an 11.=
6 percent annual return on investment.  Alternatives include: requiring pow=
er generators to accept up to one-third less than the collective $3.5 billi=
on they're owed; taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off=
 its debts; and allowing Edison to build more power plants. The latest prop=
osal would require the state to sell bonds to pay off Edison's debts and gi=
ve the state the option to buy the transmission lines later. Most of the pr=
oposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off deb=
ts.  One hurdle the legislature faces: rallying two-thirds of each house be=
hind one plan, necessary any time the state spends money. Republicans have =
been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines, and half the =
alternatives include that element.  But Stanford University professor James=
 Sweeney thinks compromise is possible. Lawmakers and the utility will stri=
ke a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the=
 state's political leaders. Sweeney believes, however, the outcome might be=
 more fair in court.  "Bankruptcies are messy ... but so is the political p=
rocess,'' Sweeney said. "We're in a situation where the leadership (politic=
ally) seems not willing to bite the bullet. It may be better for our state =
to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isn't planning for a =
higher office.''   =09








      Long Beach obtains lien on Edison's assets  The city is the fourth sm=
all supplier with an attachment on the utility.  May 24, 2001  By KATE BERR=
Y The Orange County Register  The city of Long Beach became the fourth smal=
l power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Ed=
ison, a move that could push the utility closer to bankruptcy.  Last week, =
Edison was ordered to freeze at least $9 million in bank accounts to cover =
payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city's trash-t=
o-energy plant.  Getting a lien on the utility's assets ensures the city wi=
ll be paid, even if the utility files for bankruptcy.  Stephen Pickett, Edi=
son International's general counsel, said the utility plans to appeal.  Lon=
g Beach also is suing Edison International, the utility's parent company, f=
or breach of contract, claiming the utility should not have transferred $4.=
7 billion to its parent company over a four-year period beginning in 1996, =
when deregulation was implemented.  "Edison International was required to h=
onor the debts of its subsidiary,'' said Robert Shannon, Long Beach's city =
attorney.  So far, Edison has been sued by 27 small power suppliers, known =
as qualifying facilities, or QFs. The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on=
 the utility's assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate 20-ye=
ar contracts to provide power to Edison.  Edison owes QFs about $1 billion =
and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles.  B=
ut Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay i=
n its contract with Edison.  "We just want to be paid under our contract. W=
e still want to deliver them power,'' said Shannon.  As a municipality, Lon=
g Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs =
must.  Ed Feo, a lawyer for wind, solar and biomass QFs, said liens on Edis=
on's assets could have a domino effect.  "Two things will accelerate a bank=
ruptcy filing by Edison: Either the deal to sell its transmission lines (to=
 the state) is going nowhere and alternatives are not acceptable - or if at=
tachments are made to the company's property that the utility doesn't want =
to run the risk of losing.''  Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain l=
iens against Edison. They include Caithness Energy, which got a lien on Edi=
son's 56 percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Moh=
ave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev.; IMC Chemicals, a unit of IMC Glob=
al Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., and that won a $7 million lien; and Herber Geo=

Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdin=
gs,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi=
ng
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewate=
r
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. Th=
e
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


"The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region," said Curt Hildebrand, vice president a=
nd
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  "We look forward=
 to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center."


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


"We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,"
Hildebrand added.  "We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible."


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the officia=
l
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental an=
d
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops =
and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  =

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gra=
y
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving constru=
ction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

"California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapo=
n is
to build more power plants," Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natu=
ral
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which ha=
s
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than=
 they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants an=
d the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax m=
oney
so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them.


Among other measures to ease the power shortage, the state government has c=
alled
for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can, especially durin=
g the
peak-hours during the day.Residents have been told to brace for a worse
situation during the incoming summer.

Lockyer: Probe may spark suit=20
Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging=20
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU=20
SACRAMENTO -- State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his invest=
igation of alleged multibillion-dollar price gouging by power generators ha=
s laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could win huge refun=
ds.=20
"But the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said in an interview with =
ANG Newspapers.=20
The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eigh=
t weeks also may yet yield criminal charges, which could result in power co=
mpany officials being locked up "with my tattooed dude."=20
Lockyer, a former East Bay legislator, rattled electricity suppliers earlie=
r this week when he told the Wall Street Journal: "I would love to personal=
ly escort (Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he coul=
d share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.'"=20
Houston-based Enron, like other energy-trading firms, has denied wrongdoing=
 in the California market. It dismissed Lockyer's comment as not warranting=
 a response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration. Other power co=
mpanies have expressed outrage.=20
"I was trying to convey a message to ... the out-of-state energy generators=
," Lockyer said. "I decided to make the point with the energy generators th=
at they've got a serious fight on their hands."=20
The attorney general, however, conceded he has "felt guilty about it ever s=
ince because I'm a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about these=
 sorts of accusations or claims."=20
"But I know it won't be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to=
 ... pump up the rhetoric," he said.=20
"We don't care if they're multi-millionaires. We don't care if they run big=
 corporations. They're buccaneers. They're ripping us off.=20
"Now, while we're still in the legal analysis of whether it's legal or ille=
gal greed, it's clearly immoral. There's no debate about that."=20
Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transa=
ctions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the strength of =
the state's case.=20
"I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful=
 civil action, but the whole house hasn't been built," Lockyer said.=20
A civil case could result in refunds that "disgorge the obscene profits," h=
e said.=20
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's elect=
ric transmission grid, estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged =
California by $6.8 billion since early last year.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered Cal=
ifornia suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as pa=
rt of that agency's ongoing probe.=20
Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that comp=
any officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices.=20
The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eig=
ht weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three ene=
rgy firms -- Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta.=20
The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal document=
s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe.=
=20
"They've been throwing $500-an-hour lawyers at us in high volume to drag th=
eir feet and stall our investigation," Lockyer said.=20
The attorney general's comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and allegati=
ons by California officials against power suppliers, as well as ongoing pro=

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MS").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint "warrants expeditious action."

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO "maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay."  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could "choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets."

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, "To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW."

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace."  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  "Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price."

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, "ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs."  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market ("OOM") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, "such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff."  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, "and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price."

ISO is then "put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets."

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to "straddle the fence" and that, "Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role."  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, "Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move."  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, "thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' "  Hebert states that, "The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter."  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, "including the California markets."

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dan

In the Room

Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a 
few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended 
for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other 
ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).
Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the 
IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The 
prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered.
Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible 
on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).
IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., 
BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.
Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.
Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part 
existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with 
the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate 
increase.
Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough
Enron able to take low profile.
SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing 
could be achieved.
Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed 
epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.  

Out of the Room

Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.
Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.
Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC 
involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable 
resolution.

Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks

Judge asked everyone to consider how to "Share the Pain" for Thursday's 
meeting and said not to expect any "win:win" scenario. His view is that FERC 
is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.
His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 
12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its 
supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward 
contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose 
this, I believe.
Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.

Subject: Hendricks (SDWR case) - TRO Order



Per Doug Tribble's prior email, attached is a copy of Judge McConnel's order
denying Aguirre's TRO application in Hendricks v. State Department of Water
Resources.

Also, for those of you who may not have seen it, here is Doug's status
report:

The TRO was denied based upon the court's finding that the plaintiff
has failed to establish a reasonable probability of success. From the tone
of the opinion it would appear that the DWR has a very good shot at
defeating the case at demurrer. The AG told me the demurrer must be filed
today and the court set a hearing on the demurrer this Friday! I will have
the order sent out shortly. DRT

I've reviewed the attachment that I previously forwarded to you with Gary 
Fergus.  Basically, the CalPX "converted" any unsigned performance bond into 
"additional collateral requirements" for both CORE and CTS markets [this 
relates to the letters received by EPMI, EES, and PGE today regarding 
unsigned indemnity agreements; please let me know if you did need a copy of 
them].

Questions are (1) do they have a right to do this although it is not under 
the tariff and (2) I thought Enron was already obligated under the CTS bond 
requirements via the "rider" to Enron's existing surety bond w/AIG that was 
handled in 1999 supporting CTS activity?  Richard, didn't they verbally 
communicate that to you when you visited them last week as well?

With respect to the letters received by all 3 Enron entities:
EPMI received (2) letters from the CalPX - one for the CORE and one for the 
CTS market.  However, EPMI did not receive a margin call today (as indicated 
in the letter that the PX would do) for any deficit...based on the attachment 
below, EPMI has a deficit in the CORE market of ($32.2MM).
EES received (1) letter from the CalPX pertaining to the CORE market.  EES 
also received a VERBAL margin call today i/a/o $18MM.  EES has current 
collateral in the form of a $2MM letter of credit (which was originally 
posted to the CalPX in order to establish EES as a market participant so that 
EES could use the PX for market viewing purposes).  Since EES has been an 
inactive PX participant and I did not see how EES could get a margin call 
based on the definition of charge-backs, I called Chris Anderson at the PX to 
get an explanation.  Chris Anderson indicated that yes, although EES has 
never been active, Lynn Miller (CalPX CFO) is taking all steps to send out 
letters to any and all participants who have not signed the indemnity 
agreement and following through with any necessary margin calls.  The $18MM 
margin call is per Chris Anderson "a formality measure" although he did not 
figure that EES would post $18MM collateral.  He also stated that he did not 
see EES getting an invoice in the future or being paid anything in the future 
given its inactive status.  I expressed my concern that the PX would 
potential draw down on the existing $2MM letter of credit if EES did not post 
the $18MM margin.  He said that the PX would only draw down on the L/C if 
"EES did not pay an invoice from the CalPX."  So, unless something new arises 
out of the tariff [such as a revision in the definition of charge-backs], I 
do not foresee EES receiving an invoice in the future from the CalPX but you 
never know.  IT IS STILL A MARGIN CALL for $18MM.
PGE also received (1) letter from the CalPX pertaining to the CORE market.  
However, PGE did not receive a margin call today (as indicated in the letter 
that the PX could do).  I spoke with Tyesha Woods, credit mgr at PGE, 
regarding the letter and its current collateral position with the CalPX.  
Tyesha Woods indicated that during her last conversation with the CalPX, 
since PGE was due money for power deliveries, the CalPX should "net" any 
required collateral from PGE from its expected receivables.  The PX at that 
time agreed to use the as an offset.

    Tim,
     Wednesday the California Deputy
Attorney General agreed to the following treatment of email at the Portland
facility.  I confirmed this procedure in writing to him and have not heard
any disagreement:

    In Portland, we proposed to handle business
email related to the topics in your preservation letter by instructing
employees not to delete any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that
is personal and does not relate to the business topics you have identified
can be kept, discarded etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a
backup made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After
24 hours, each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem
appropriate to the business needs (e.g. keep, discard).

     In addition, I discussed with the
Attorney General the following procedure for when an employee runs out of
hard disk space on his/her computer.  Again, I have not heard any
disagreement regarding this procedure.

    When an employee runs out of hard disk space
on their computer, it is an acceptable practice to copy files from their
hard disk to the network (where they will be backed up) and then delete
those copied files to make sufficient work space for the employee to work.

    Below are our recommendations for the text
of an email to all EPMI personnel in Portland.  Dan Dietrich has confirmed
that the IT backroom support for this policy is in place and that we may
implement today.  Please send me a copy of the email that you distribute.

    Thanks
    Gary

    Text for your email:

    This message will update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

    We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


    Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

    (1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

    (2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

    (3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

    (4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

    (5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

    (6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

    (7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

    (8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


    In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

    Please respond promptly to this notice via
email.  Your email should state that you understand and intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Campbell v. SDGE
 Enclosed is that docket sheet, complaint and removal petition for
the Campbell case filed against SDGE in November and removed to federal
court.
  <<Campbell.v.SDGE.PDF>>
EPMI Current Trading Activities
 We reviewed the FERC orders from Friday night and discovered that a
penalty has been created for generators that refuse to sell energy to the
ISO in an emergency.  You will recall Tim Belden telling us that he had made
the decision not to sell out of market to the ISO because of the refund risk
and the credit issues.  When I asked Tim whether in his view we would be
considered a generator if we are long on power that we have the exclusive
right to sell.  He said he did not know and welcomed our advice on the
topic.  He wanted to know, for example, when is it an emergency.  He also
told me that the ISO has sought from the Secretary of Energy a declaration
of emergency under Section 202(c) of the power act.  Under that provision,
apparently if asked for energy, you have to deliver and worry about getting
paid later (my uninformed interpretation.)  At Robin's suggestion, I
contacted Dan Watkiss who was going to get his team to evaluate quickly and
provide advice by tomorrow morning.
Selected Contract Analysis  (Randy Conner)
 Tomorrow we will be sending to all of you copies of the contracts
and draft contracts selected by Christian Yoder and Steve Hall that might
relate to marketing of various strategies to customers.
Subpoena Scorecard
 Peter Meringolo is preparing a scorecard of which agency has asked
for what documents and information for distribution.
Extended Contact List
 Here is a contact list that includes experts and some key Enron
personnel.

Resend of status report. The hearing date is April 17, not April 12.


> As reported in Tim Taylor's prior email, Judge Moskowitz deferred ruling
> on the motion to stay pending resolution of the Section 455 issue.  Judge
> Moskowitz rejected plaintiffs' argument that defendants should be required
> to formally move to recuse, stating that he felt required to resolve the
> Section 455 issue before proceeding further.  On the other hand, he did
> not accept our argument that judicial economy favors deferral of the 455
> issue to the MDL Panel, stating instead that he needed to resolve the
> issue, lest the Panel designate him as the MDL transferee court for cases
> he could not accept.
>
> Judge Moskowitz continued the matter to April 17 at 2:30 pm (PST), at
> which time the Court will hear oral argument on both the 455 issue and the
> stay motion.  In the interim, the parties will brief the 455 issue in
> accordance with the following schedule:
>
>  Plaintiff's brief  -  April 2
>  Defendants' response - April 10
>  Plaintiff's reply -  April 12
>
> As to the stay motion, Judge Moskowitz indicated he would need to review
> the issues raised in the remand briefs before deciding the stay motion.
> He stated that, generally speaking, if the remand motions require
> substantial effort and raise issues on which reasonable minds could defer,
> then he is inclined to grant a stay, given considerations of judicial
> economy and the public's interest in consistent rulings.  While Judge
> Moskowitz was careful to note he has not decided this issue, many of the
> defense counsel who attended the hearing came away with the impression
> that the Court is favorably inclined to the stay arguments.
>
> As to the timing of the remand motion, Judge Moskowitz stated that, if he
> does not recuse himself and if he does not stay the cases, the remand
> motion will be heard "a couple of weeks" after April 17.   Plaintiffs
> expressed concern that the remand motion be heard before the MDL rule in
> May.  Judge Moskowitz did not commit to any specific schedule, but
> appeared receptive to plaintiffs' position on this timing issue.
>
> A transcript has been ordered and should be available on Monday for
> circulation.  Several counsel have suggested that we have a group
> discussion after we review the transcript to assess our options on the
> various issues, including the Section 455 issue.
>
> As such, we have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, March 28 at 11
> am (PST).  The dial in number is 1-800-210-5603 (pass code 5103596#).  I
> will circulate an agenda before the call.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

Sue,

I noticed Hoecker's statement too.  I do not, however, believe that he is 
breaking new legal ground here, although the reference to Section 309 is (I 
believe) the first time in these cases that FERC or any of the individual 
Commissioners cited specifically to this section of the FPA as possible 
authority for ordering retroactive refunds prior to the 10/2/00 "refund 
effective date."  (I have attached Hoecker's opinion; the reference to 
Section 309 is on page 11.)

Section 309 is the provision of the FPA that grants FERC authority to take 
action "necessary and proper" to carry out the other substantive provisions 
of the Act, such as ensuring "just and reasonable" rates under Section 206 of 
the Federal Power Act; however, the courts have interpreted Sec. 309 as not 
expanding FERC's substantive authority otherwise granted under other 
provisions of the Act; it only provides FERC with authority as necessary for 
it to fill in the "missing blanks" in the substantive provisions of the Act, 
such as Sec. 206.)

Several years ago, FERC ordered retroactive refunds in a Washington Water 
Power case where the utility had violated its tariff.  Here, Hoecker is 
simply suggesting that FERC could do the same if it turns out that any seller 
violated the ISO's or PX's tariff last summer by engaging in "collusion, 
predatory pricing, or unlawful manipulation of prices."  As long as EPMI 
followed  the ISO's and PX's market rules last summer, I see nothing in 
Hoecker's opinion that undermines our view that the filed rate doctrine 
prevents refunds of all amounts collected in accordance with the market rules 
prior to 10/2/00; i.e., in the absence of a violation of the tariff or FPA, 
nothing in Hoecker's opinion suggests that Sec. 309 modifies the prohibition 
of Sec. 206 against retroactive refunds prior to the refund effective date 
(10/2/00).

Dan and/or Ron,

Hoecker is quoted here as saying (p.2) that FERC has all the authority it
needs to "disgorge" profits under Section 309 of the FPA.  What are your
thoughts?  Is this the first time that section has been mentioned?

Sue

I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information.  Here are
the facts we have so far.  On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with
FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel
the production of documents and to shorten time to answer.  According to
Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC
moved against the following entities:  AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant
and Southern.  Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B.  This is not to
say that we could not be easily added to the group.  While the motion reads
as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they
state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.  We will
have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this.  To
repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Thanks
Gary

Subject: Important - CPUC Motion - Confidential Attorney Client
Privilege and Work Product


As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a
protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened
from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this
on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.

They request that we be required:
   to answer their motion on Thursday,
   to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering
   production, and
   to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals,
   specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and
   price.

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its
proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would
oppose their requests for:
   the information to be provided for "government eyes only" -  this would
   prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants.
   a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to "share" this
   information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding)
   pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission
   to make information available to state commissions as may be of
   assistance in state regulation of public utilities.  We should argue
   that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public
   utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale
   marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are
   the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this
   information.)
   the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the
   competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the
   Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's "unfettered access" to the
   forwards market.  This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can
   get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from
   the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

 Senators Dunn and Bower and their staffs met with representatives of
Mirant, Wiiliams, Duke, Reliant, and Dynegy- and me- for over two hours at
the State Capital yesterday. I will report fully on the meeting by telephone
tomorrow morning, however, this report summarizes the principal issues
covered in the session.
 Dunn spent about a half hour describing the scope of his
sub-committee's investigation. He styled it as an investigation into whether
anti-competitive behavior has occurred or is occurring in the California
wholesale market. If they find that it has, they will recommend curative
legislation. If they find the behavior was criminal they will refer evidence
to the AG. Dun vowed that he would not allow parties adverse to the
generators to participate in this investigation. At the same time he is
inviting other county and state lawyers to help him- the first volunteer is
the San Joaquin District Attorney. He said there was no predetermined
conclusion and he would allow the generators to explain the "suspicious"
facts. He said the investigation would be fair and that if there was a leak
of information we should "let him know". He had two initial requests- first,
he wants immediate production of Enron's document retention (he actually
called it document destruction) policy. We are to let him know by Wednesday
if we will produce the current version. Second, he wants the parties to
stipulate to an order pledging that each will not destroy documents. He says
he will go to court to get such an order if we refuse.
 The rest of the meeting was spent negotiating a confidentiality
order. The generators had earlier sent sub-committee special counsel, Larry
Drivan,  a discussion draft of such an order. Dunn and Drivan discussed it
point by point. At the onset Drivan acknowledged Enron had not seen the
draft and said nothing said at the meeting would bind Enron to any position
about it. The generators and Dunn seemed to agree on many of the principal
points- e.g. they would in fact consent to such an order; the subcommittee
could contest claims of confidentiality; the subcommittee could require the
logging of privileged documents and the assertion of privilege could be
challenged in court; they would all initiate a procedure for a court to sign
such an order and preside over discovery disputes. Surprisingly, most
generators did not object when Dunn suggested Sacramento Superior Court as
the proper venue-although there was no final agreement on this. The dispute
between the committee and the generators was primarily over who could view
"confidential" documents. The generators wanted NDA's signed by all staff,
as well as all consultants and experts. Dunn refused.
 Last week the subcommittee subpoenaed the ISO for documents that
pertain to ISO conclusions of market manipulation. The ISO has refused to
allow the generators or Enron see the documents they will produce. The
generators have discussed seeking a protective order- venue uncertain- but
Dunn (and most of the generators) seemed to believe the stipulated
confidentiality order under discussion would solve the problem of ISO
production. Duke asked Dunn to delay the production date for ISO for a few
days until they can work out the terms of the confidentiality order. Duke
(per Kleinman) is in charge of drafting the order. Kleinman said he would
get a draft to Dunn early next week. Dunn said he had no objection if the
generators got documents from ISO. He asked that the generators call ISO
directly and see if ISO would give the documents to them. Several generators
said they would do that.

 The meeting was maintained at a very professional level. Dunn's
approach was one of a class action lawyer in a roomful of big corporate
defendants- urging everyone to get along because as "professionals" everyone
knew how the game gets played. However, he is seriously understaffed. He has
few resources for litigation- nor has he resources to review the millions of
documents he has requested. He must be relying on either outside experts- or
outside allies- to do that. Given that, it is hard to see how a
confidentiality order could be enforced against him, regardless of what he
staff discloses. Further,` if he uses outside experts to do who are not
bound by the order they will likely go to work against us later with the
information. The generators already have made considerable productions to
the AG and they may be less troubled by this. They certainly seemed willing
to play ball at the meeting- although privately they may have other plans
which they did not air with Dunn. We should talk to them about that.

The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a
court tells them not to.  DO we care about this?

Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC--
given the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info?

Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's
request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC
claims identify those who have abused market power.

To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO
Tariff
section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC
subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly,
the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20
unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator
unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4
which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is
providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the
requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in
the
past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an
outage and projected in service date since this information could be used
by
Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a
request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current
requests.

The prehearing conference in the CA case was an interesting proceeding.  It=
 became very apparent that the ISO was primarily responsible for the delay =
in producing data.  The parties complained that they had not received what =
the ISO had promised.  The PX complained that they had received NO reliable=
 data from ISO (it was riddled with errors) and that they were at the same =
point as at the beginning of the entire proceeding.  The PX needs the ISO d=
ata in order to commence generating the data that the PX itself needs to pr=
oduce.  In any event, the new, delayed schedule is a positive development. =
 It is noteworthy that we were able to group consideration of refunds issue=
s and offsets to refunds on the same date- October 26 (previously refund te=
stimony was considered first, and testimony related to possible offsets to =
refunds was considered on a subsequent date).  This is very positive since =
it reduces the chance that the proceeding will be only about refunds and th=
at the offsets issue will be marginalized.  Ray Alvarez

The DC Team (Linda Robertson, Ray Alvarez) attended and reported on today's=
 prehearing conference in the California case.  The schedule has moved back=
 about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to prod=
uce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on tho=
se revised prices.  Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due un=
til October 26.  In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported th=
at the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order=
 until October 15, 2001.

A revised schedule is attached.  (To see how it has changed, you can toggle=

The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections =
rather than actual changes to the schedule.  Notably in today's case, Seatt=

I wanted you to be aware that we may start to see some negative press from 
Sen. Peace.  We be working up some potential responses, although we may end 
up simply not responding publicly.

		 Subject: Peace Targetting Market Players

FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the 
street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the 
"misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney 
thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of 
California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain 
child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also 
set up the Governing Boards.

hly updates, and clarification on confidential treatment


To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

Today the ISO received an amendment to the subpoena from the California
Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC")  issued May 25 (and circulated to
Market Participants on that date) and requiring a response by June 4.  The
subpoena of May 25 and the amendment require monthly updates on an ongoing
basis. The ISO intends to comply with the monthly update requirement.  In
addition, the ISO received a letter from the CPUC clarifying the
confidential treatment it will afford confidential information produced in
response to the subpeona and amendment.  The May 25 subpoena and the
amendment and letter on confidentiality are attached.

In its June 4 production and subsequent monthly updates, the ISO will mark
as confidential documents it produces to the CPUC that contain information
subject to 20.3.2, and will request confidential treatment in accordance
with the CPUC's letter on confidentiality. Concerns related to the subpoena
should be relayed directly to the California Public Utilities Commission.
The CPUC contact related to the subpoena is Robert Cagen who can be reached
at (415) 703-2197.   The ISO would appreciate being notified also of any
concerns.  The ISO contacts are Jeanne Sol, at jsole@caiso.com and Norma
Formanek at  <mailto:nformanek@fbm.com> nformanek@fbm.com both of whom
should be copied on correspondence.

We have put together the following list of issues for the request for 
rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input 
about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who 
will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests 
for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001.

We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap 
and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit
$150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?)
Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not 
be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts.
The FERC should clarify its statement that "to the extent the IOUs' resources 
exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at 
wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules."  A literal 
interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and 
prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their 
generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options 
but we are concerned about less liquidity.
Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request 
for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from 
Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs.
We oppose the 27-month refund period
We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF)
The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being 
paid the cost of cover for exports

Richard and Elizabeth,

At Christian's suggestion, I am sending a memo I prepared summarizing some of 
the more exotic strategies used by our traders.  Christian has reviewed the 
memorandum and believes that it will assist you both in preparing for our 
Thursday meeting.  Between now and Thursday, Christian and I are going to 
analyze the ISO tariff to determine if the tariff prohibits any of these 
strategies.

Steve

As promised, attached is a further draft reflecting our conversation this
afternoon.  The significant changes are in paragraph 3.   I may not have
included all of the persons to whom this email should have been addressed
(my list group email addresses is running out of room for email addresses),
so please forward this email to anyone at your company who should have this
that I have neglected.  And . . . convey my apologies.

I have advised Larry Drivon that he will have a draft midday tomorrow.  I
told him that I can "walk" him through the draft tomorrow afternoon if he
wants (but that I am NOT authorized to "negotiate" the provisions), that we
should schedule a call for early next week to address areas of disagreement,
and that we should address how we get an order before a court.  I told him
that that means that he probably will have to delay the ISO compliance
somewhat farther, but that we can take this a step at a time.

My secretary will circulate call in instructions tomorrow morning for our 11
a.m. EDT call (8 a.m. PDT).

As you may know, prior to the start of the last day of the FERC meetings in
Washington DC on Monday, the CalPX submitted to the setttlement judge an in
camera list of the issues that the Committee has been discussing with the
CalPX.  The list did not describe the pending proposals as to how the issues
were to be resolved; it only listed the issues according to the CalPX.

Based upon the list submitted to the settlement judge, I wanted him to know
that the Committee is discussing the issues with the CalPX.  I had a meeting
with the judge and his staff, with the CalPX and its FERC counsel present,
to let the judge know that settlement discussions were underway, but I did
not know whether the Committee would ultimately approve the proposals that
were pending at that point (the July 8 proposal that was sent to the
Committee).  He asked for a copy of the proposal, which I handed his staff,
and he suggested that I describe the proposal to all the sellers in the room
after the California and IOU representative leave.  I told him that I could
not describe the proposal as anything other than a proposal that Powerex
supported and that there were others on the Committee that both supported
and did not support the proposal as it stood at that point.  He told me to
make the presentation and to tell the group that it was not a Committee
proposal at that point because there were both Committee members that
supported and did not support the proposal at that time.  I did indicate,
however, that I was working hard to develop a consenus on the Committee to
support the proposal.

At the judge's request, I made a presentation to all the sellers that were
in the room after the State and IOU representatives left at about 4 pm.  I
did not indicate the names of any Committee members that supported or did
not support the proposal, although I did tell the group that Powerex
supported the proposal.  The lawyer for Mirant told the group that Mirant
was not in support of the proposal at that time.

Lynn Miller from the CalPX and her FERC lawyer were in the room, which was a
good thing as it turned out.  A number of sellers asked whether there was
some way to avoid sending any money to the CalISO without some assurances
that it will be distributed to the appropriate sellers in that market.
Although the CalPX had previously been reluctant to include in the proposal
any language regarding how the CalISO makes distributions, based on the
discussion in the room, CalPX has agreed to escrow amounts payable to the
CalISO, subject to Committee oversight, to ensure that the CalISO directs
that the funds be distributed to the parties entitled to the funds and does
not just turn them over the CDWR or someone else, like the Governor.

Similarly, based on the discussion in the room, the CalPX has agreed to
modify the proposal to provide that any funds that come in the future can
first be used to "true up" the prior distributions back to the beginning
based on the differences in the amounts previously distributed and the
amounts that would be distributed based on a net receivable approach.

There were a few other changes that seemed to make sense, which I have
incorporated into the revised draft attached hereto.  I also attach a
redlined copy to show the changes from the July 8 draft that was circulated
last week.  It appears that the Committee now has more time to discuss and
consider the proposal, although the judge's staff indicated to me that the
FERC would like to receive a proposal that is endorsed by the Committee as
soon as possible because the FERC is anxious to resolve the remaining CalPX
issues.

During my presentation to the seller group at FERC on Monday, a number of
sellers asked for a copy of the proposal.  I was handed about 100 business
cards asking me to send out copies.  At this point, I would prefer to send
out copies only after the Committee has developed a consensus to support the
proposal.  Therefore, I am not sending out copies at this time.  I ask that
all Committee members also not send out copies at this time.

Thank you all for responding to calls on short notice last week.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
