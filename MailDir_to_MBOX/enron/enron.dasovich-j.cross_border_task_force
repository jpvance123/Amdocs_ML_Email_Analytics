Listen, in order that Jeff is not tagged to do double duty ( or half duty), I 
think I should ask Mary Hain to join the group to work with Rob (and Jeff if 
he wants) on the Northwest.  Agree?

Jeff--

Over the last couple of weeks, I have been compiling some information 
regarding the Rio Bravo project and other Mexican affairs that Enron is or 
could be involved with.  This is not a complete list, but at least it is a 
starting point.

I just want to confirm how we have agreed to proceed:
We will start our work focussing on " b)  Commercially Significant 
Interfaces"  rather than "a) Identification  etc." , on the understanding  
that our work on the regional issues may shift into a discussion of  a). 
We will work in three sub-groups:  Northeast (Roy Boston, Steve Montovano, 
Aleck Dadson), South (Ricardo Charvel, Kathleen Magruder, Jeff Dasovich) and  
Northwest (Rob Hemstock and one or both of Jeff Dasovich / Mary Hain*).     * 
I will approach Mary Hain to join the group and work in the Northwest 
subgroup. 
Each subgroup will produce a workplan  and focus document by the end of 
February.  Those three documents  will be circulated to the whole group and  
discussed on a conference call for the whole group  in the first week in 
March.  
Each subgroup will make their own  determination about  how they will  carry 
out their work:  meetings, telephone calls, e-mail, etc.; but the  group will 
endeavour to do all  of its group-level  work by e-mail and telephone. 
We will aim to have a work product to deliver from the group  by May.  At 
this stage, it is likely that the final work product will consist of a 
document  or documents  identifying impediments and opportunities and  the 
ways of mitigating/pursuing them.  However, as we discussed on the call, we 
should keep an open mind about the nature of the work product.  We will have 
a better idea of what work product to aim for after the completion/review  of 
the initial workplans.

Tom,

I hope I gave you enough information in our conference call today.

Attached you will find a translation of a document that was given to the 
developers by CFE (Federal Commission of Electricity/ incumbent 
monopoly/national electric utility) in which after describing what it wants 
to do with RIo Bravo III project it asks 10 questiont to the possible 
participants.

Basically in this bidding process they want to give the alternative of 
buiklding an IPP or of importing energy based on a long term contract.




On the West coast the opportunity is the other way around.  Theoretically we 
could export energy from Mexico to the U.S. The problem here is that the 
California ISO will not make capacity payments for a plant in Mexico.  If we 
do not have those capacity payments the economicas of the projects will no t 
work .  Dave Parkay from West Origination I think sits on the board of the 
ISO.


If you need anything else please call.

A quick download on our conference call:  We agreed to split the larger group 
up into 3 working groups.  The 3 of us are in the southern group.  (I, for 
one, would be happy if all future meetings were held in Mexico City or San 
Francisco.)  By Feb 29, we are to circulate to the larger group a report on 
existing commercial problems along the US/Mexico border, e. g. continuing 
difficulties with El Paso Electric and moving power across the border, and 
recommendations for their solution.  Those recommendations could be much 
farther reaching than just a complaint action against the utility.

It is my impression that there could be significant opportunities if we could 
move more power south across the border, but that there is real intransigence 
on the part of the utilities on this side.  I have no idea what the situation 
is on the other side of the border.

Why don't we trade emails and voicemails over the next few weeks and try to 
schedule a conference call the week of Feb 14?  That will give us about 2 
weeks to get a written report together and to follow up on our brilliant 
discussions.   If you have a better idea, let me know.
