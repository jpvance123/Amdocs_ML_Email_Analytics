  Market Participants,

  The California ISO is conducting an Internet site usability
study to determine how we can improve our Internet site. Toward this end, we
have contracted with Carta, Inc. to conduct a site study and recommend
revisions for the site. Stakeholder involvement is an important part of this
process.  We have prepared a Web Site Usability Survey as a part of this
effort. This survey is on-line at our site.

  Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey at
http://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html
<http://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html> . Your feedback is vital to the
success of this program. Responses will be sent directly to Carta for review
and tabulation.

  Please note, this project does not involve the OASIS section
of our site. The OASIS redesign project is a separate effort. See
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/xml/ <http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/xml/>
for information on the OASIS redesign effort.

  If you have any questions, please contact the ISO Webmaster.
Thank you for your continued support.

I somehow created two of the same files that are linked, and I cannot unlink 
them. The files are xxx4:1 and xxx4:2. I have tried closing the iles and 
closing excel, but when I re-open xxx4, both the files are re-opened. This is 
a very important file, so I need help as soon as possible. Thank you.

Jeff and Bob, 

At Tradition's request, I put together a one-page explanation of CAISO Firm 
Energy.  I thought you might find it handy to have it to hand when discussing 
this with counterparties.

please tell people that it was prepared by a market participant at 
Tradition's request.  I'd rather keep Enron's name out of it.

Thank you in advance for helping us with this.

Bob,
Wanted to say hello. My trip to Ireland and England
was a blast. Had a good time in both countries. A lot
of history blah, blah, blah. Been with the first
Marines for about two weeks and I am beginning to
figure my way around. Working out every day and
running (on my own) a great deal. Do not want to be
the wimp of the bunch. Should be fun two years with a
lot of training which will culminate with a deployment
to WestPac next year sometime and thats it.

Otherwise thing are good for me. I will be heading bck
to NY for the third week in Sept to attend a wedding
of my HS friend Gary. You probably remember him. Will
be home for a week. First time since I left Med
school. Taking my girlfriend with me back home. She
has already met the Rat in Vegas. She also met Gary
and his bride to be when they came out here for  a
week in the winter.

Hope all is well with you. Any little Bobs in the
future? Stay in touch and I hope the Yankees can hold
on and the Knicks finally unload the old man. Now,
there is no way they can compete with Miami.

Later,
Fran

Below is a summary of my SWPTF, CAISO and SW IOU's meeting 10 days ago.  The 
meeting was very positive and it looks like we are getting traction on 
getting the SW IOU's to join the CAISO as an option to continuing with DSTAR.

Call me if you have questions

possible merger of the California and Desert Southwest regions into a

On June 5, a meeting was held in Phoenix to discuss the terms under
which various parties would seriously consider a proposal for
consolidation of California and the DSW under a single RTO operated by
the CAISO.  This was the second meeting that was held to discuss this
idea.  Represented were the CAISO, APS, PNM, TEP, EPE, TNP, APSES,
NewEnergy, Enron, Calpine, PG&E Gen, Southern, Duke, Cal PX, and DOE.

The issues that were discussed included the CAISO's ability to implement
the major components of the DSTAR commercial model, the changes that
would need to be made in the CAISO's governance and internal structure,
and costs.

The parties at the meeting were generally in favor of:  (i)
consolidating the existing control areas into a single control area as
soon as possible, (ii) migrating to a common set of market protocols on
a fairly rapid basis, (iii) creating a single, independent, RTO
governing board with no bias in favor of either California or the Desert
Southwest region, and (iv) migrating from a regional advisory committee
structure to a single advisory committee structure as soon as possible,
to avoid balkanization and accelerate convergence.  Most parties felt
that there were, at this time, no "show-stoppers" on most of the issues.

For many of the participants, the most significant outstanding questions
were: (i) the costs (both $/MWh and cost shifts) that Desert Southwest
parties would incur under the consolidation scenario, and (ii) timing -
i.e., whether the necessary implementation, governance and
organizational changes could be put into place by a target date of June
2001.

It was agreed that the next step was for the CAISO, working with
interested parties, to provide a tentative implementation cost (both
with and without consolidation of DSW control areas, but in both cases
with independent procurement and operation of ancillary services).

The agreed-upon Action Plan was as follows:

June 9: CAISO to develop list of questions which need to be answered to
enable it to develop a cost estimate

June 16: CAISO to respond to the list of questions generated at the June
5 meeting

June 16:  CAISO to be provided with responses to the CAISO's list of
questions

June 16: Transmission owners to provide to the CAISO their definition of
the scenario(s) that they desire the CAISO to consider in developing its
cost estimate

July 10: CAISO to provide cost estimate

July 20: Meeting in Phoenix to discuss the cost estimate, address any
additional questions, and discuss the viability and possible contents of
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

July 31:  Decision from all interested parties regarding their desire to
move forward

August 15: Assuming a positive outcome on July 31, meeting to discuss
finalization of an MOU which would address the commitments of the
parties, market structure, changes in governance, organizational goals,
priorities and structures, etc.

Status:  The first four items above are close to completion.   The CAISO
has sent a list of technical questions to Carl Imparato and he is
completing a response.  The CAISO is completing its response to the list
of questions it received on June 5.  The interested transmission owners
have defined the scenarios that they wish to see considered by the
CAISO.

When all of these documents are finalized, which I expect to occur in
the next 2-3 days, I will forward them to all of the addresses.

If you have any questions, please give call me at 510-558-1456.

 *DJ Calif Assembly Delays SDG&E Rate Roll-Back Vote To Thu

 Question About Who Will Pay Elec Bills

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The California State Assembly has postponed until
Thursday
 a vote on restoring electricity rates for customers of San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. to
 pre-deregulation levels, according to a spokesman for Assemblywoman Susan
Davis
 (D-San Diego), who is sponsoring the bill.

 The bill was sent to the assembly's appropriations committee because some
 representatives are concerned about who - if not SDG&E customers - will pay
for
 electricity in the city this summer and past spring. The difference between
what SDG&E
 customers would pay under the legislation and what SDG&E is paying for
supplies in
 the skyrocketing electricity markets has been estimated at $1.5 billion.

 Assembly Passage Of Measure Uncertain

 The legislation would roll back electricity rates to June 1, 1999, levels
for customers of
 SDG&E, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE). This spring and summer, the utility's
 customers have received electricity bills that are nearly triple what they
were last year.

 Electricity rates for the state's other utilities haven't been deregulated
yet, so their
 customers are receiving fixed prices per kilowatt-hour of power used.

 Prospects for passage of the bill, AB 2290, are unclear in the Assembly.
The California
 State Senate passed the bill unanimously last week. But it would need 54
votes to pass
 through the 80-member Assembly before Gov. Gray Davis could consider
signing it into
 law.

 If all 47 Democrats approve the measure, it would need at least seven
Republican votes
 to pass. But, as reported Tuesday, only three Republican lawmakers said
they would
 support the bill.

 The rollback would provide some economic relief to SDG&E's 1.1 million
customers,
 who have been paying market-based rates for electricity since June. If the
rollback is
 approved, utility bills for residential customers would be about $55 to $60
a month,
 according to SDG&E.

 Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said the governor hasn't decided
whether he
 would sign the bill into law if approved.

 Monday, the state's Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposal to roll
back rates,
 instead approving a stabilization rate plan that would reduce the cost of
electricity to
 about $68 a month for residential customers who conserve usage.

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL / CALIFORNIA 

Critics Seek
More Control
Over ISO 
By Marc Lifsher 

08/09/2000 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page CA1 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Some people want the California Independent System Operator to be a lot less 
independent. 
The Folsom-based nonprofit corporation, which acts as the traffic cop for the 
state's electricity grid, has been a lightning rod for criticism during this 
summer's power crisis. Though generally praised for keeping lights on in the 
face of severe shortages of electricity, the ISO has come under fire for 
failing to move more quickly to lower the maximum price it will pay 
generators for emergency power to meet demand and prevent blackouts. 
Pressure on the ISO has eased considerably since last week, when its 
governing board voted to lower the cap on such same-day, emergency purchases 
-- the only type of pricing it has the power to affect directly -- to $250 a 
megawatt hour from $500. But the heat hasn't been turned off completely. Some 
lawmakers still are calling for changes in the 26-member ISO board, which 
includes people nominated by power generators, utilities, middlemen, and 
commercial and residential customers, among others. The critics want to 
streamline the board and make it more accountable to the state's elected 
officials. 
The ISO was created by the state's 1996 utility-deregulation act to transmit 
electricity smoothly between generators and utilities. Lawmakers devised the 
independent board as a way to give the various "stakeholders" -- generators, 
utilities, middlemen, customers and environmentalists -- a say in how energy 
is supplied. Members serve for up to three years. 
"It's inappropriate for the ISO governing board to vote on issues that 
benefit them financially," says Sen. Dede Alpert, a Coronado Democrat. She 
questions the wisdom of allowing out-of-state energy sellers and marketers to 
sit on the ISO board and vote on emergency prices, especially when they have 
an interest in keeping those prices high. 
Sen. Alpert spent much of the Legislature's recent summer recess fielding 
complaints about high electricity costs from her constituents, customers of 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Last 
summer, SDG&E became the first investor-owned utility in the state to have 
price regulations fully lifted. This summer, its rates have doubled, as high 
temperatures and power shortages have swept the West. 
In response to a series of price spikes in Southern California and the wider 
contention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation, 
state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing tomorrow in Sacramento. High 
on the agenda: possible changes in the ISO's governing structure and scrutiny 
of the way it handles power statewide on hot days. Critics say emergency 
purchases should be no more than 5% of electric-power sales, but were as high 
as 33% of the market on hot days earlier this summer. 
Key legislative leaders -- including Sen. Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democrat 
who was the architect of the 1996 deregulation law -- would like to make the 
ISO more accountable to state elected officials. 
Possible changes include preventing industry representatives with conflicts 
from sitting on the ISO board, as well as abolishing the ISO entirely and 
shifting its responsibilities back to state utilities, under the supervision 
of the state Public Utilities Commission. Until 1996, the PUC regulated all 
electric utility rates and services. 
ISO board members say legislative critics are unfairly focusing anger over 
the price spikes on the ISO, which has only a limited ability to set prices. 
Most electricity isn't sold through the same-day, emergency market -- but 
through long-term contracts between sellers and utilities, or at least a day 
in advance through the California Power Exchange, which is a nonprofit 
corporation established by the 1996 law to serve as a trading floor. 
"We need to create a government structure that is not susceptible to pressure 
from one state senator or anyone else," to keep prices artificially low, says 
ISO Chairman Jan Smutney-Jones, who represents the Independent Energy 
Producers Association, the trade group for non-utility power generators. He 
dismisses criticism of the board's out-of-state members. There needs to be 
"an independent, interstate board" because energy is transmitted across state 
lines, he says. Two Houston-based power sellers on the board, Dynegy Corp. 
and Enron Corp., deny any conflict. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief 
executive, blames state officials for expanding the ISO's role to include 
monitoring prices. "If there's any finger-pointing," Mr. Watson says, "they 
probably should start with the big finger pointed right at them." 
Substantial restructuring of ISO governance could prove difficult. The state, 
through the governor-appointed Electricity Oversight Board, has limited power 
to make changes. Past efforts by the Oversight Board to exert control didn't 
go far. 
Last year, state lawmakers tried to give the Oversight Board the power to 
confirm or reject ISO board members to make them accountable to state 
officials. (Nominees had previously gone on automatically.) The effort was 
opposed by officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 
Washington, D.C., which argued that the state couldn't have veto power over 
the nominees of out-of-state power producers. In a compromise, California 
officials were given authority to veto half the board -- those nominated by 
residential, industrial, commercial and agricultural power-users. 
The federal energy commission has final regulatory authority over the ISO and 
has viewed state attempts to meddle with the agency as an unconstitutional 
attempt to hinder interstate commerce. 
Any proposed changes in ISO's governing structure "would be looked at very 
closely by FERC," says ISO attorney Richard Jacobs. 
This summer, the ISO board displayed an independence that was annoying to 
state lawmakers. In June, Sen. Peace called on the board to lower its price 
cap for emergency purchases, from $750 a megawatt hour (roughly the amount of 
electricity needed to power 1,000 homes) to $250. The board responded by 
lowering the cap to $500 a megawatt hour. A second attempt to lower the cap 
to $250 failed to get a majority vote. 
The reason? The three private power-seller representatives, including the 
Independent Energy Producers Association, were joined by those representing 
agricultural, industrial and commercial users in opposing a lowering of the 
cap. 
Then, the pressure on the ISO board really intensified. Gov. Gray Davis 
weighed in, by sending the ISO board a letter asking it to lower the cap "to 
the lowest possible level." Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered the 
representative of federal-public-power sellers to change his vote from no to 
yes. A consumer representative from the League of Women Voters also moved to 
the "aye" column, allowing the cap to be lowered to $250. 
Lowering the cap removes some of the rate pressure on residential and 
commercial consumers in San Diego -- and takes some of the heat off the ISO 
board. But not entirely: A Public Utilities Commission report on the state's 
electricity market that was sent to the governor after the vote said that the 
members of the ISO and the Power Exchange boards "can have serious conflicts 
of interest" and that both organization aren't "accountable to the state or 
its consumers." 
An ISO spokesman said the board is in the process of producing a formal 
response to the report and it declined to comment. A spokesman for the Power 
Exchange said that it has followed the law regarding conflicts and that it 
does protect consumers.

MARKET NOTICE---EMERGENCY OPERATING ORDER RELATING TO UNINSTRUCTED
DEVIATIONS JULY 31, 2000

This notice is to advise all Scheduling Coordinators and owners of
Generation in the ISO Control Area that the ISO is issuing an operating
order for July 31, 2000, that all resources must follow final Hour Ahead
Schedules, as adjusted by RMR Dispatch Notices, or by Dispatch instructions
verbal or electronic, on Ancillary Service or Supplemental Energy bids.  NO
UNINSTRUCTED DEVIATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED.  Section 2.3.1.2.1 of the ISO
Tariff requires Market Participants in the ISO Control Area to "comply fully
and promptly with the ISO's operating orders." Any Generating Unit with real
time output that reflects an excessive deviation from the real time output
consistent with its Final Hour Ahead Schedule as adjusted by Dispatch
instructions, and assuming a 20 minute ramp across the top of the hour for
hourly Schedule changes, will be deemed to have failed to comply with this
operating order.  For the purpose of this determination, an excessive
deviation shall be the smaller of 10% of a Generating Unit's maximum
capability, or 10 MW.  The only exception to this finding is a Generating
Unit that provides the ISO with timely notification of a unit outage or
derate. Failure to comply with this operating order threatens the reliable
operation of the ISO Control Area.  In particular, uninstructed incremental
deviations by Generating Units that are "chasing" the BEEP Interval Prices
published by the ISO are directly responsible for the frequency excursions
the ISO experienced  June 13, 2000. The ISO will take the following actions
with respect to those Generating Units that fail to comply with this
Operating Order: 1) ISO Management will deliver a report to the ISO
Governing Board that provides a copy of this notice, and a comparison of the
instructed and actual output profile for each Generating Unit that fails to
comply. 2) The ISO will assign any WSCC RMS penalties associated with
frequency deviations to the Generating Units that fail to comply.

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you.

Subject: Steve Peace


Bob:

I cannot make this stuff up.  Steve Peace, the Senator famous for his
fight to protect the California Rate Payers, came to fame as the writer
of the Critically aclaimed film, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.  I
didn't believe it either until someone sent me this web page, with his
link attached to it.

http://www.lexingtonnet.com/tomatoes/creators/index.htm


title.gif (1905 bytes)

This page is dedicated to the three demented geniuses who brought us the 
Killer Tomatoes films!

?

John DeBello - Director/Writer

John DeBello was the director of all four Killer Tomatoes films. He also 
played small roles in each film, even playing himself in a few! He still runs 
many parts of Four Square Productions, I'm told.

?

Steve Peace - Writer/Actor

Steve Peace is probably best known in the KT films as Wilbur, the dim-witted, 
parachute-wearing leader of the Killer Tomatoes Task force. He also wrote 
parts of the films as well. Now, he's a state Senator, and even has his own 
page at http://www.stevepeace.net

?

Costa Dillon - Writer

Last, but definitley not least is Costa Dillon. He's responsible for the 
entire concept of Killer Tomatoes! Like everyone else here, he played small

library in the original film, who cleared out the room by merely saying 
"Tomato!". This little part was later used as a major character in the 
cartoon series.

Both SCE and PG&E have been authorized to purchase energy, capacity, and 
ancillary services through bilateral contracts.
Quantities are limited to previously authorized limits in the forward market 
(the PX Block Forward Markets)
The contracts must expire on or before 12/31/05.
For both PG&E and SCE, these contracts will be subject to limited 
reasonableness review.
PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition 
period ends (3/31/02). The Commission will continue e to oversee the 
procurement practices on a quarterly basis. 
This was an emergency motion, so it is reasonable to assume that both PG&E 
and SCE can enter into such transactions immediately.

SDG&E is authorized to enter into bids for 6*16 delivery period or a 7*24 
delivery period for terms of 8/00 through 12/00 or 8/00 through 3/01. 
SDG&E will submit bids to buy energy a levelized price for both terms.
SDG&E will bid only for small commercial and residential customers under 20kW
The quantities are limited to the quantities that they had approved in the 
BFM participation spelled out in advice letter 1234-E. I do not have a copy 
of that advice letter off hand but will provide you with the information 
tomorrow.

We will provide you with more details soon.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Attached are the decision related to the above issues.

FYI,
We are at a point with the mail server that is going to require me to shut it 
down during the day today and perform hardware upgrades. That is unless 
everyone and I mean everyone goes through their mail and cleans out the sent 
mail, inbox and trash folders. If this is not done soon then mail will stop 
functioning all together.
I would prefer to upgrade the hardware in the evening but this will take 
several hours.

So please help out by cleaning house on your mail, otherwise we will be 
forced to do the upgrade in the middle of the day.

Thanks,
MIke Mc.

  The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholder
meeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO.  The meeting is a broad
stakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001.
Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions on
lessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technical
standards, contractual issues, and load management.

  Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that would
aggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day ahead
energy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.
This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order to
accelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot program
to test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program will
test the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,
ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demand
responsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in the
afternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to the
stakeholder group.

  In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that the
ISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has  experienced
considerable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that would
include entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for both
Generators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.
This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining to
installations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providing
Ancillary Services to the ISO markets.

  The agendas are attached for both events, including
directions and lodging information.
  Please RSVP by September 13, 2000 to Sue Happ at
shapp@caiso.com.
  Thank you.

Legal has been assessing the risks of doing block forward trades as financial 
and for now, subject to future changes that may be required  as discussions 
with the CAPX legal experts continue,  we can state the basic rules as 
follows:

It is okay to do up to 50% of  our Block Forward business as financial.
It is very important to monitor this 50% level very closely and we should not 
exceed it. We should not rely on the PX to tell us what the level is. We 
should confirm it ourselves.  A skeptical regulator, looking at PX records 
should never be able to see that we ever did more than half our block forward 
business as financial.  
One of the legal rules that we must comply with in this area is that there 
must be a bona fide commercial reason for going financial.  This 
dumbfoundingly simple sounding rule is important.  Somehow, when we 
communicate our decision to the PX to go from physical to financial, we 
should give our reason.  I'm not sure whether our decision is expressed by 
phone, or electronically, but in either case,  the person making the change 
with the PX should get in an expression something like this:  "we would like 
to change these trades to financial because we think the elimination of 
physical risk will benefit us commercially."  Please be patient with this 
self serving requirement and do it. 

 I have not worked out with any of the other back office groups how this new 
practice will be handled. Obviously any changes it will require in 
scheduling, settlements and accounting need to be dealt with too. Please call 
me with any questions.  ----cgy

FYI,
It has been a valiant effort but as soon as we free up space on the Notes 
server it fills back in. 
So as a result we will be shutting down the notes server tonight from 8:00 PM 
until 12:00 AM to rebuild the data drives. This will provide more space to 
work with and allow for room to grow.
We will also be turning on a purge agent in 2 weeks that will eliminate mail 
from your Inbox, Sent Mail and Trash after it reaches 30 days of age.
Please shut down Lotus Notes before you leave to night to help ensure we do 
not lose any data.

Thanks,
Mike Mc.

We recently installed two new digital copiers in the break room.  For the 
most part, they are very user friendly, and I have been able to make 
different types of copy jobs without any training at all.  However, we have 
the capability to provide formal training with a Xerox representative on a 
prescheduled basis.  

A training session, which can accommodate five people for training, is 
scheduled for Thursday at 9:30 a.m.  The training takes an hour and a half.  
If more than five individuals request training on Thursday, I will schedule 
another training session at a later date.

For your information, if you are not interested in formal training there is 
an instructional CD that you can borrow to learn about the features of the 
equipment, and there is a manual you can borrow if you would like to borrow 
it for instructional purposes.

Please contact me if you are interested in attending Xerox training on 
Thursday at 9:30 a.m. or if you would be interested in training at another 
time, and I will coordinate these training efforts.

Let me know if you have any questions.

 THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

=0F"Are those folks smoking crack?=0F" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =
Ol=0F'
Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power
business here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint
Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to
improve either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment
California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.

=0F"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing
utilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F" he mused between sips
of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F"Come to think
of it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F" I recalled,
=0F"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the
ISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build
them.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB
Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State
agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F"

I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know
California will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out
of the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.

=0F"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the
ISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator
planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F" Dave added. =0F"So you agree
with Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F" I retorted. =
=0F"Oh,
I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,
and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest
market went against me,=0F" Dave recalled.  =0F"I called everyone who I tra=
ded
with, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what
will it cost for 50 MW?=0F"

=0F"Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F" I wondered.  =0F"I didn=0F't want to=
 show him my
position.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for
50, first,=0F" Dave chided.

=0F"What happened?=0F" =0F"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=
=0F'd
take it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took
that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F" lamented Dave.  =0F"He just
wanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say
the traders are jigging it.=0F"

=0F"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is
what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess
at the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess
wrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on
to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of
a generating plant.=0F"

And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a
target for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=
l
wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average
trading price climbs even as the so-called =0F"dysfunctional=0F" price spik=
es
are eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic
principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the
imposition of an additional constraint.

I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.

>>> Things in the Mailbag

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report
 @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings
 @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market

>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)

>>> Things in the Mailbag

It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.
Here is what my friends have been writing me.

FPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F"Please Gary=
,
no more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the
year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really
not know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on
with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???
Bay!!!!=0F"

It is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation
so much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger
sorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to
participate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about
Fentergy PLus?

Next, from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F"As you've heard from
others, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material
each week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a
sprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral
regarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I
think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the
industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to
successfully open this market.=0F"

Thanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this
stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have
learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk
(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of
how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.

A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note,
which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F's.
It=0F's okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for
that sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions
are cool with us.  =0F"Just curious - has anyone been comparing high
unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are
up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego
consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated
unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few
months?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from
how much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those
who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford
the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the
consumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the
unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side
responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`I
can't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F'
vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F"

Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not
telling who, I received the following: =0F"I ... broke down and listened to
the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that
the "speak fast" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,
what a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke
volumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye
out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]
... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,
the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do
all that much.=0F"

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report

Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the
PUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of
it for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's
website.

=0F"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of
certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to
the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13
and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage
instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone
-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific
local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of
generation from outside the area.

=0F"The Report states that the ISO =0F"never tried=0F" to call upon consume=
rs to
reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO
had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to
reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under
which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail
energy use in exchange for a fee

=0F"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by
=0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=
1.2
billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the
mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by
the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the
total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward
contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy
markets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F"lock-in=0F" a specific
price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are
specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and
are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that
some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the
recent price spikes.

=0F"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F"might well=
=0F"
have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in
May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would
have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of
peak demand, when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted, the
ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order
to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral
basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control
area.

=0F"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F"are not now
competitive=0F" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the
normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee
has noted that =0F"market power in the California energy market appears to
arise
primarily during periods of peak demand,=0F" and warned that demand growth
would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.

=0F"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested
board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the
case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and
to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that
wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public
interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and
approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every
aspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.
The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the
state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants
in the FERC proceedings.

=0F"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected
by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made
California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is
unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states
coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both
generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability.
Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.
Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and
siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will
this significant shortage be addressed.=0F"

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings

If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California
legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs
of electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight
Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their
facts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly
hearing was like.

It started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one
of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to
heap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill
Keese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,
and he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.
One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a
single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land
with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are
searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace
of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal
returns on investment.

Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)
of the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San
Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did
not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He
said it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a
solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done
listening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price
hikes.  Yikes!

Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but
in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese
correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California
problem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked
what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and
construction process?

Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week
to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a
6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the
applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and
air offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get
to the CEC.

The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too
hard on her last week, calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.
Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer
instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the
pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction
of the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised
to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact
SDG&E rate caps (told you).

The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.
Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F't that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in
place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what
these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.
The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the
wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give
back the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith
answered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It
takes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria
for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F's
based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high
prices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you
could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from
the US Court of Appeals.

Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were
stumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F't you, Mr. Smith of FERC,
today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that
generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and
retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?
Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar
strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and
forth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in
the past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect
for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a
mob.

For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be
undertaken by the PUC.

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market

Well, the official title is, =0F"Order Instituting Investigation into the
Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on
Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &
Electric Company=0F".  I like my title better.

This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the
Commission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale
markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in
San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.

Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:

=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=
nd
small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the
functioning of the wholesale market?)

=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or
other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess
reasonableness?  Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers
on just and reasonable terms?

=0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=
nt
customers?

=0F=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX
coordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and
irregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?

=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve
practices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the
Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole?

>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)

As promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, Barb
Ennis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.
Listen up!

She writes:

Hi Folks......

For folks that may want to tour, Hearst Castle is located only 30
minutes from the Inn at Morro Bay. Within walking distance of the Inn is
a Natural History Museum, a marina with kayak and canoe rentals.
Shopping and dining along the Embarcadero, and some great hiking.

World class wineries and tasting rooms numbering over 40 are located
within a short drive from the Inn.

If you choose to drive it is 3-hours from San Jose, American Eagle,
Skywest and United Express all serve the local Airport in San Luis
Obispo.

Duke Energy is willing to conduct a Plant Tour (A woman=0F's only plant

The object of humor notwithstanding, and seeing how the flow of new
material has slowed a bit, my wife provided this week=0F's laughter.  She
didn=0F't have to attend the Senate hearing.

Subject: The Brilliance of Women

There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a
helicopter.  Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one
person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and
everyone would die.

No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really
touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the
others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands
and children and giving in to men.

All of the men started clapping.

Bob,

Two things:

1.  Send these sentence to the Cal Px:

"Enron thinks that the elimination of physical risk during the month of 
August will be of commercial benefit because Enron expects that during the 
month of August there will be transmission line derations affecting the hour 
ahead market which will lead to TO debit charges by the CAISO.   The 
elimination of  TO debit charges is a commercial benefit to Enron. "

I will call them and discuss this with them when I get back on next Tuesday.

2.  Do not do any financial BF trades in September.  Let's sort it back 
through with them.  The letter is surprising and we need to figure out why 
they sent it.  One month of financial at 50% is ok, but lets not do any more 
till we talk to them. ----cgy

  Market Participants:

  At the May ISO Governing Board meeting the Board directed
Management to bring back to the Board a recommendation on the "parameters
and process" for proceeding with a competitive solicitation (Valley-Rainbow
RFP) to determine if there are cost-effective and reliable alternatives to
SDG&E's proposed Valley-Rainbow transmission project. The specific Board
motion can be found at:
http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/BOG/documents/motions/20000525/Board/SDGEValle
yRainbow500KVProject.htm
<http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/BOG/documents/motions/20000525/Board/SDGEVall
eyRainbow500KVProject.htm>  and additional information on the project can be
found at http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/sdge500kvtrans.html.
<http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/sdge500kvtrans.html>
  These matters are scheduled to be addressed at the August 1
Board meeting. Attached is a memo that outlines ISO Management's preliminary
thoughts and recommendations on how to structure the process for conducting
and the parameters of the Valley-Rainbow RFP.  Please provide us your
thoughts and feedback on these matters no later COB Friday, July 21.  Please
send your comments to: sgreenleaf@caiso.com <mailto:sgreenleaf@caiso.com>
and btheaker@caiso.com <mailto:btheaker@caiso.com> . While the
recommendations outlined below are clearly a work-in-progress, it is
imperative that we receive your substantive feedback early so that we can
develop a fair and reasonable final recommendation. Thanks for your time and
consideration.

We have had some confusion recently with respect to coverage when someone is 
out of the office.  From here forward, please provide the following 
information to me via e-mail for days when you are out of the office:

Curve coverage - who is responsible for ensuring that your curves are updated 
and downloaded in an accurate and timely manner.
EOL coverage - which products need to be maintained and who will make the 
markets in your absence.

This new procedure is effective immediately!

This morning, we announced an offer to acquire London-based MG plc, one of=

that our successful business model, which we have proven in the natural gas=

Our offer to acquire MG plc has been unanimously recommended by MG plc=01,s=
=20
board of directors, and we expect to close the transaction by early third=
=20

approvals.

MG plc is a leading independent company in global non-ferrous metals tradin=
g=20
and marketing and the only such company that is publicly traded. =20
Headquartered in London with major offices in New York and Frankfurt, MG pl=
c=20
has 330 employees in 14 countries.  It is the world=01,s leading copper=20
merchant, one of the top three merchants of copper concentrates and nickel,=
=20
and a leading European merchant of recycled metal.  Other products that MG=
=20
plc markets include aluminum, lead, tin, zinc, brass and stainless steel.

This transaction provides Enron with access to new customers and enables=20
cross-marketing opportunities.  We plan to sell Enron energy products to MG=

outsourcing.  Enron will help producers and consumers manage the risks=20

MG plc=01,s existing market-making capabilities and market knowledge provid=

FYI.  The report posted on the website fails to include the report's 
transmittal letter.  I just found that letter in the mail.  The letter 
explains that the report's analysis DOES NOT include "the events" of May, 
June and July, which the Compliance unit is currently studying.  It will 
release the results of that study in the Fall.

Subject: CalPX Market Compliance Unit Submits its 2nd Annual Report to FERC

Submitted to FERC on 7.31.00.  Key findings:

"The markets work."
"...virtually all price increases in the past two years can be explained by 
underlying known factors such as weather, natural gas prices, and forecasts."
Almost all of the price increase during year 2 is explained by market 
fundamentals...The unexplained variance in price is small and appears to have 
contributed nothing to the trend."
"...a Compliance mean reversion model indicates that prices typically return 
to mean price levels in less than two days."
"...the price increases...show no indications of deliberate attempts to 
manipulate prices...."

ISO FALL 1999 UFE PROJECT
RETROACTIVE MARKET ADJUSTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

June 15, 2000

MARKET PARTICIPANTS & SC SETTLEMENT CONTACTS;

NOTIFICATION OF RETRO-ACTIVE 1999 UFE MARKET CORRECTION

On July 3, 2000, the ISO, consistent with its commitment to the Market
Participants, will initiate Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) market adjustments,
for Market Settlements from August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999.

These adjustments result from the correction of  meter data errors,
identified and corrected by the ISO UFE Project. The Market Participants
have been very cooperative in working with the ISO.  The mutual objectives
were to assure accurate settlement of Imbalance Energy, to rectify start-up
meter data management problems and to minimize UFE.

The overall magnitude of erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project is
approximately 1,100,000 MWhs or $ 70,000,000.  The ISO Settlements and
Metering Department staffs are in the process of recalculating the specific
market charges impacted, for this period.

Actual retro-active UFE adjustments will commence on July 3, 2000, and be
applied initially to the May 9th Preliminary Settlement Statement (PSS). The
ISO's intention is to correct 15 settlement days per week over the next 10
weeks until the entire 1999 August 21-December 31 period settlements are
corrected.  The ISO Settlements system time required to rerun settlements
constrains our ability to proceed more expeditiously.  However, we do plan
completion by the end of Summer.


The ISO will apply retroactive adjustments to ALL UFE related Market
charges. The erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project will be charged
to the responsible Scheduling Coordinators (SCs), to help assure that no
adverse market impact occurs from cost shifting.  Other SCs will receive the
associated charge type credits.



FINAL REPORT TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS - Fall 1999 ISO UFE PROJECT

On August 21, 1999, UFE in the PG&E Service Area increased substantially,
ranging from 4-15 %.   This inordinately high UFE continued in excess of
typical amounts of UFE for this UDC Service Area (-1 to +1%), for four
months.

The ISO actively investigated potential systemic causes for this order of
magnitude increase in UFE.

ISO efforts consisted of a concerted review of SQMD submitted by SC's during
this period, a review of the ISO MDAS polled meter data for ISO metered
entities, a review of interchange data (exports), a review of the
Transmission Loss calculations used by ISO Settlements to calculate UFE by
UDC, an investigation of the Market Redesign Settlements software changes
associated with the drop of new Settlements software in mid- August and the
retention of a data consultant to help identify and isolate any causal
factor, attributable for the high UFE .


The effort to identify UFE related settlement issues for the period of
August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999 is complete.  The ISO UFE Project
team, working in conjunction with Market Participants, identified over 1.1
million MWH of erroneous UFE. This UFE is now accounted for, and will be
reassigned to the responsible SCs. The ISO Project identified over 14 casual
sources of UFE during this period.  Many of the issues identified were
interrelated.

The last major source of UFE for the period was identified in April. This
UFE resulted from an erroneous Validation, Editing and Estimating (VEE)
factor, applied to firm load within the PG&E Service Area.  This error,
associated with late or missed meter data adjustment, commenced October 1,
1999 and resulted in understated SC load of approximately 100 - 267 MW/hour,
through December.

The balance of the SC meter data management errors previously identified
were attributable to the complexity of using Pseudo Resources and Logical
Metering to model, schedule and settle Municipal UDC existing contracts
(ETCs).

The four primary SCs which experienced meter data problems, within the PG&E
UDC Service Area, have resubmitted corrected Settlement Quality Meter Data
(SQMD).

The ISO will initiate retroactive UFE Market adjustments for the Settlement
period of August 21,1999 through December 31, 1999.  The magnitude of the
Market UFE adjustment is approximately $70 million. These retro-active
Market adjustments will complete the Project Team's work on the Fall 1999
UFE issue.


Present UFE Status:

March 2000 UFE, based upon Final Settlement Statements (FSS), is as follows:

System UFE         +
0.22 %
PG&E UDC Service Area UFE   + 0.17 %
SCE UDC Service Area UFE    + 0.44 %
SDG&E UDC Service Area UFE   -  0.45%

News Brief:
+TXU Europe puts gas assets up for sale
FT Energy's Gas Daily Europe reports that TXU Europe is putting its North
Sea gas assets up for sale. The utility confirmed today that is in
"preliminary talks" with a number of third parties, but stressed it was
"very early days". The move follows "a number of unsolicited expressions of
interests" in the business, including its operatorship. TXU said it is
reviewing this part of its business and will only decide whether to sell at
its conclusion. It has not set a deadline for the review.

A source inside the company was not surprised at the review: "The business
has changed a lot in the last year." TXU has already put up its UK
generation assets for sale, and this latest move to divest gas assets could
mark a shift in strategy to focus on trading and retailing. Some analysts
believe that assets no longer give "competitive advantage" to energy
companies, as the focus shifts towards the end-user and convergence of gas
and electricity.

TXU's principal production assets comprise the operating licence and 64.2%
of the 83bn ft? Johnston gas field, plus 14.75% of the 33bn ft? Ravenspurn
North field, 11.24% of the 5bn ft? Welland field and 4.83% of the 17bn ft?
Schooner field. It also has a number of upstream exploration licences and
interests in pipelines.

Load is up in CA and so is the potential for selling load curtailment 
products to customers.


BOTTOMLINES:

PG&E has asked the CPUC to approve participation of E-19 and E-20 Direct 
Access customers in the ISO A/S load participation pilot program (filed June 
7).

SCE has asked the CPUC to approve that all customers on its Large Power 
Interruptible tariff can participate in the ISO A/S load participation pilot 
program (filed June 7).

FERC approved the ISO's Load Participation pilot progam and pricing on June 
14, 2000, calling it an innovative program.

This appears to be a total GREEN LIGHT for Enron to move forward with 
customers.


PROCESS:

The utilities filed advice letters.  Comments are due on June 27.  Unless you 
tell us otherwise, we plan to file and seek expedited treatment. (The CPUC 
has no required timetable in which to respond.)  We expect the CPUC to 
approve them -- there is pressure from many fronts to DO something about load 
participation in the market.  Both have asked for a July 17 effective date.


DETAILS:

SCE's is a much better document and makes a good case for CPUC approval, even 
though the the customers are already benefitting from providing the utilities 
with the option to curtail during system emergencies. SCE proposes the 
following approach to prevent "double-dipping" by the customers:  If the ISO 
directs SCE to activate its load curtailment program during the time period 
that the customer has an accepted bid from the ISO in the A/S market, SCE -- 
working with the ISO -- will adjust the customer's bill to avoid double 
payments.  SCE provides no more information, but, on principal, this seems 
fair to me.  We'll have to watch to see what the proposed procedure would be.

PG&E doesn't say much except that it is "unable" to offer this to bundled 
customers (oh, gee -- must be more of those "system constraints") until 
"later" (unspecified).  I would expect large customer groups to argue about 
that -- but it gives us the opportunity to push direct access.  PG&E didn't 
have much to offer on the "double-billing" issue -- it said either PG&E could 
change the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment.

FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, other 
munis) and approved the ISO's proposal.  The big issues were:  supposed 
improper allocation of demand relief program costs (ISO allocates it to all 
SCs based on metered demand during all hours of the program);q request to 
charge those who are out of balance for most of the costs; the need to file 
pro forma agreement in advance (FERC said ISO doesn't have to); and the 
supposed overly restrictive program participation. If you want to know more 
about the order, give me a call.

Have fun!

Quantity Limits- For SCE and PG&E, previously approved BFM limitations are 
the following:
SCE 
Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and 
balance of the month BFM products:
Retail Energy markets are limited at SCE's net short position which is a 
maximum of  
 Q1: 2,200 MW, Q2 2,200 MW, Q3: 5,200 MW, Q4: 3,000 MW
Participation ion daily and balance of the month BFM products are limited to 
amounts above 1,000 MW SCE's net short position.

PG&E 
Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and 
balance of the month BFM products:
Retail Energy markets are limited at PG&E's net short position which is not 
disclosed. However it is reasonable to assume that it is at least 3,000 MW 
for the summer quarters given that PG&E had previously filed asking for a 
limit of 3,000 MW.
 Participation in daily and balance of the month BFM products are limited to 
amounts above 1,000 MW PG&E's net short position.

SDG&E BFM limits approved in Advice Letter 1234-E
Monthly and Quarterly Forward Market:  1900 MW July-September, 1700 MW all 
other months
Daily and Balance of Month quantities will not exceed 1000 MW more than the 
limits in the forward markets
Ancillary Services  will not exceed 90% of SDG&E's forecast ancillary 
services for the month or the quarter.
SDG&E's limits are ultimately limited to the load to customers under 20 kW.

Subject: Bilateral Contracts for SCE, PG&E and SDG&E

Both SCE and PG&E have been authorized to purchase energy, capacity, and 
ancillary services through bilateral contracts.
Quantities are limited to previously authorized limits in the forward market 
(the PX Block Forward Markets)
The contracts must expire on or before 12/31/05.
For both PG&E and SCE, these contracts will be subject to limited 
reasonableness review.
PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition 
period ends (3/31/02). The Commission will continue e to oversee the 
procurement practices on a quarterly basis. 
This was an emergency motion, so it is reasonable to assume that both PG&E 
and SCE can enter into such transactions immediately.

SDG&E is authorized to enter into bids for 6*16 delivery period or a 7*24 
delivery period for terms of 8/00 through 12/00 or 8/00 through 3/01. 
SDG&E will submit bids to buy energy a levelized price for both terms.
SDG&E will bid only for small commercial and residential customers under 20kW
The quantities are limited to the quantities that they had approved in the 
BFM participation spelled out in advice letter 1234-E. I do not have a copy 
of that advice letter off hand but will provide you with the information 
tomorrow.

We will provide you with more details soon.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Attached are the decision related to the above issues.

 *DJ Calif. PUC Approves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPX

 Mandatory Buy Requirement Ends For Utilities

 LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission
approved a controversial plan Thursday morning that
 will allow the state's three investor-owned utilities to buy power outside
the Caliifornia Power Exchange market structure.

 The commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the measure. Commissioners Henry
Duque, Richard A. Bilas and Josiah Neeper voted
 in favor of the draft order.

 The decision relieves the three investor-owned utilities, Sempra Energy
unit San Diego Gas & Electric (SRE), Pacific Gas &
 Electric (PCG) and Edison International unit Southern California Edison
(EIX), from their mandatory buy requirement that
 became effective in March 1998 when the state moved to a deregulated
competitive market. Originally the mandatory buy
 requirement was set to end in 2002, when all three utilities recovered
their stranded costs.

 "This decision is not as earth shattering as it sounds," Commissioner
Bilas, one of the author's of the draft order, said at
 Thursday's meeting. "I am not criticizing the power exchange. But this will
result in lower prices patched through to bundled
 customers."

 Trading platforms likw Automated Power Exchange and the New York Mercantile
Exchange can now compete directly with the
 CalPX, which currently controls 85% of the state's wholesale power market.
The utilities can buy power from other "qualified
 exchanges" through an advice letter process.

 Utilities Can Trade With Other Exchanges Now

 California's big three utilities can buy power outside the CalPX market
structure immediately, through an advice letter process,
 which means the utilities have to notify the commission of their intent to
trade power with qualified exchanges such as APX,
 Nymex or Bloomberg.

 The commission said the exchanges have to offer the same services as the
CalPX - forward, daily and monthly trading, and
 anonymity to prevent self dealing between the buy side and sell side - in
order to meet the criteria for a qualified exchange.

 Exchanges would also have to be independently owned from the utilities.
Enron Online would not meet the criteria for a
 qualified exchange, commissioners said.

 The advice letter only needs to be filed once and s merely a formality that
would not need to be approved by a majority of the
 commission.

 Mark Huffman, PG&E senior attorney for regulatory affairs, told Dow Jones
Newswires that his company "will quickly start
 looking at other exchanges and see what's out there. We're going to start
the advice letter process."

 SoCal Edison and SDG&E said they will do the same.

 Ed Cazalet, chairman and founder of APX, said Thursday's controversial
three-to-two vote in favor of the draft order "creates a
 tremendous opportunity for APX."

 "It allows us to bring the benefits of Silicon Valley technology to
California," Cazalet said. "This is really about bringing
 e-commerce to the market."

 E. Jesus Arredondo, however, disagreed, saying "selling into our market
doesn't cost anything and selling into the APX market
 costs 20 cents per megawatt-hour."

 Commissioner said having other exchanges will not only result in lower
electricity prices, but it will allow the buyer and seller
 the chance to see prices before making the purchase.

 CalPX's block forward prices are not immediately published, Commissioner
Bilas said.

 Reacting to the ruling, CalPX Chief Executive Officer George Sladoje said
"Today's split vote by the CPUC in favor of
 accelerating the introduction of other qualified exchanges is not
well-reasoned and it may in the end prove counterproductive."

            Distribution Company of potential power shortages and request
            the UDC to advise end-use customers to reduce demand to minimum
            requirements without disruption of employment or curtailment of
            industrial production or commerce. Advise the UDC to prepare for
            imminent implementation of the interruptible load programs and/or
            electrical emergency plan.

Market Participants,

Several market participants have been engaged in a practice of scheduling
large amounts of non-firm counter flows on congested branch groups in order
to earn hour-ahead congestion revenues and then not providing those counter
flows in real time.  This occurred during a Stage 1 emergency on 7-20-00.
This practice creates a significant reliability problem for the ISO and is
to the detriment of market efficiency.

This notice is intended to inform Market Participants that the ISO
Department of Market Analysis considers this a potentially serious "gaming"
practice as defined in the ISO Tariff MMIP 2.1.3. The ISO DMA will be
investigating any Market Participant found to be engaging in this activity
and will take appropriate corrective actions.

Subject: ISO To Participate in Super Peak Market


Folks,

Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier
the same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to
place 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO
little choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to
cover their peak hours on hot days.

Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and
California PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am
working with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.
We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or
earlier.

Key people who you may need to contact:
ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are
also in the loop)
PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123
PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124
APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123
APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159

Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have
not had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the
California PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint
WPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this
product/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or
buy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours
of HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can
utilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will
be watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.
The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery
point, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging
transmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its
purchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will
send out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak
market.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be
posted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post
buy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.

You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a
buyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.

I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly
work together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt
the ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going
forward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to
post bids to sell?

gba

Please send out the same information to Western traders.  We would like 
everyone to continue to consider the "shortcomings" of this model.

Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at 
the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale 
market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors 
Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points:
There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West 
as well.
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does 
anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still 
incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time 
prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme.
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market.
The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided.  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to 
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity .

Subject: DJ POWER CUTS: Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply 



18:34 GMT 14 August 2000
=DJ POWER CUTS: Blackouts Lead Firms To Examine Power Supply  By Christina
Cheddar  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--For several hours on
June 14, around 97,000 power customers in San Francisco's Bay Area lost
electricity, as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. struggled to reduce its
overburdened network by taking accounts off line.  Apple Computer Inc.
(AAPL) was one of the businesses left in the dark, along with other firms
and consumers in a five-county area, as the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp.
(PCG), rotated off blocks of 35,000 customers for 60 to 90 minutes at a time
after other attempts to reduce demand failed.  Apple considers itself
relatively lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day thanks
to a contingency plan, according to spokeswoman Lynn Fox. Whether that
back-up plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other means
Apple wouldn't say.  What is sure is that as Silicon Valley expands through
the nation's most populous state - and California shows no sign of quickly
resolving its power problem - technology firms large and small are among
those businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production time.
These big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up their
regular electricity sources, industry observers said, and in some cases that
spending may be as much of a bottom-line factor as the power outages
themselves.  Unreliable power costs the U.S. economy about $50 billion a
year, said Bernie Ziemianek, of EPRI, a Palo Alto, Calif., think-tank
focused on power issues and technology. Ziemianek thinks that figure - which
considers lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products damaged
during a power interruption - could double in the next three to five years
because of the growth of Internet-related activity and electronic commerce.
Mark Mills, co-author of the Digital Power Report, a trade newsletter,
believes that cost is already higher because the economy is increasingly
dependent on reliable power. It is no longer just hospitals and military
bases that can't do without uninterruptible power; semiconductor makers,
telecommunications providers and a host of other industries cannot do
without full-time electricity.  By the end of the decade, Internet-related
activity and e-commerce could account for about 25% to 35% of the total U.S.
electric demand, said Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz, compared with
about 8% in 1998.  "The new U.S. economy can scarcely survive the annual
power outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the power
grid over the past few years," Schultz said.       Hot Days, Hot Economy -
And Hot Debate    Although the California power outage made headlines across
the country, rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as a
traffic-free Los Angeles freeway. Indeed, the state has never declared a
so-called Stage 3 emergency, which occurs when the statewide power reserve
falls below 1.5% and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a wide
scale. Rolling blackouts have been more common in the East Coast and the
Midwest, which are two areas that also are susceptible to storm-related
outages.  While some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for the
struggle to meet power demand in California, others argue that hot weather
and robust economic growth are to blame. The truth probably lies somewhere
in the middle.  A year ago, California's weather was cooler than usual, but
this year the state has had a hot summer. On June 14, the day of the Bay
Area blackout, the temperature in San Francisco reached 103 degrees, a level
not seen for 135 years. That spike, coupled with overall growth in
electricity usage, pushed the power grid to its limits.  "Over a 10-year
period, this state will need 10,000 megawatts of additional energy to keep
up with the growth we are seeing now," said PG&E spokesman Greg Pruett.
Indeed, with hot summer weather, and new capacity still a long way off, the
number of Stage 2 emergencies California has declared is on the rise. In a
Stage 2 emergency, power reserves are below 5%, and many utilities begin to
contact accounts that have identified themselves as "interruptible
customers" and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts. Those
so-called interruptible customers are typically commercial and industrial
accounts.  By early August, the California Independent System Operator had
declared nine Stage 2 alerts, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the
nonprofit agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the state,
compared with one in 1999 and four in 1998.  During a Stage 2 alert,
interruptible customers agree to cut their consumption, when asked, in
return for lower electricity rates, and often help to stave off the need to
resort to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts. However, it can
be a double-edged sword for the commercial customer, which can face steep
fines if it fails to comply with the order. Penalties can offset the savings
the company stands to gain from the program, and that's even before
accounting for the cost of lost productivity.  Aerospace and defense giant
Boeing Co. (BA) and technology distributor Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) are two
companies operating facilities in California under the interruptible
customer program. During the first week of August, each was called upon to
reduce its power consumption. Both companies see the program as a way to act
as good members of the community while saving money.  "The manufacturing of
a rocket takes two to three years," said Walt Rice, a spokesman at Boeing's
Huntington Beach, Calif., facility. "The impact (of a Stage 2 power
reduction) is fairly outweighed by the cost savings," he said.  "We live in
a state where there is a high demand for electricity, we are doing things to
shed even a small amount of that demand," said Paul La Plante, senior vice
president of worldwide facilities for Ingram Micro.  Still, company
officials admitted compliance isn't without inconvenience. Companies need to
work closely with utilities to determine the number of power interruptions
they can tolerate, Ziemianek said, but that determination can be difficult
to make.  For example, while a semiconductor plant operator knows a mere
brownout can destroy a day's production and prepares for this event, the
operator of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption a
brownout can have on the microchips embedded in its machinery, Digital Power
Report's Mills said.  Companies such as Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) and
Qwest Communications International Inc. (QWST) are spending more money on
systems either to back up, replace or supplement the electricity supplied
from the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by a
factor of at least five, possibly 10, said Mills. "The stakes are too high,
if you are Nasdaq, a dotcom or a fab maker," he said.       Other Power
Options    For that reason, companies are trying to be savvier about their
power usage. Earlier this year, Oracle Corp. (ORCL) considered going off the
power grid entirely by building its own power generation facility. A
spokeswoman for the Redwood Shores, Calif., software company wouldn't
provide further details of the plan's progress.  This option may seem
severe, but it's one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced with
extensive order backlogs, and it's also driving demand for uninterruptible
power supplies, such as those manufactured by companies like Emerson
Electric Co. (EMR), and for new power technologies such as fuel cells,
flywheels and microturbines - some of which are still years away from
commercial viability.  Others, like Silicon Energy Co., are developing
products to allow utilities and their customers to better manage their
electric consumption. Silicon's software allow its users to track their
real-time electricity consumption.  With this in mind, Mills suggests that
the real financial impact of power interruptions isn't the money companies
lose on these events, but the value of what companies are willing to spend
to cushion the blow of blackouts when they occur.  -By Christina Cheddar,

Dear All, 

I have heard from several of you today that we continue to receive Broker 
Confirms which reference "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy" for 
deals done at California Delivery Points.  I have spoken with Bob Badeer and 
he promised me that he and Jeff are going to call them as soon as they can. 

In the meantime, if for any SP15, NP15, or Z26 deals we receive a Broker 
Confirmation with  "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy", please mark 
out the former by hand and replace it with the latter. Then fax the amended 
Confirmation back to the Broker and say something in the fax Cover Sheet to 
the effect of :

"We have amended the attached Confirmation(s) to show that the relevant 
energy purchased/sold is "CAISO Energy". Please revise your Confirmation(s) 
to reflect this modification and send the amended Confirmation(s) to us and 
our Counterparty. Should you have any questions with regard to the "CAISO 
Energy" product, please contact Bob Badeer on (503) 464-3926 or Jeff Richter 
on (503) 464-3720."

Let's give Bob and Jeff some time to call the brokers and I would propose to 
reassess the situation next Monday (I am out of the office on business on 
Friday). Let's see where we are then.

Thanks everyone, 

Shari

Bob & Jeff, 

At my request, the Confirm Desk has put together a list of Brokers who 
continue to reference " West Firm" rather than "CAISO" in their Broker 
Confirmations for deals done at the California Delivery Points.  Please see 
Kim's email below. 

Could you please speak with each of them and reiterate that they must 
specifically reference "CAISO" energy in their Confirmations if that is the 
product we told them that we would buy or sell? 

Bob- I will call you later on this afternoon about Pacificorp. We got 2 more 
Confirms today with "CAISO" stricken through.

Thanks in advance guys,

HOUSTON - Enron Corp. hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in=
=20
Houston.  Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the=
=20
conference by highlighting Enron=01,s tremendous growth across all business=
es=20
and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade=
.
Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
? Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
? Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
? Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron=01,s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets wa=
s a=20
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business
Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services=
,=20
Enron=01,s largest business.  Wholesale energy growth in North America is=
=20
expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in th=
e=20
United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large=20
energy consumers.  Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead acro=
ss=20
the European continent as markets quickly open to competition.  Finally,=20
Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as=
=20
Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity=
=20
provider in March 2000.
EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales a=
re=20
generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system.  Over=
=20
450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000=20
transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November=20
1999.  Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with=
=20
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. =20
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than=
=20
costs associated with traditional transaction methods.
Enron=01,s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, =
with=20
expansions planned or underway on several of its systems.

Retail Energy Services
With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in plac=
e=20
to service customers worldwide.  As the strong contracting momentum=20
continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in=
=20
2000.  Enron Energy Services=01, goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts=20
representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and=
=20
energy services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services
The new name of Enron=01,s communications business, Enron Broadband Service=
s,=20
reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband=20
services.  Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network=20
controlled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in =
a=20
traditional point-to-point fiber network.  This Enron Intelligent Network i=
s=20
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to=20
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron=
=20
business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery.
A direct transfer of Enron=01,s core market making and risk management skil=
ls=20
from its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide=20
capacity-holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost=20
capacity.  Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such=
=20
as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with=20
differentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model.
As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Su=
n=20
Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Interne=
t=20
services.
Enron is one of the world=01,s leading electricity, natural gas and=20

Big Bob,

Writing to say hello. I returned to the states three
weeks ago and have been working at Camp Horno with the
1/1 since that time. It has been about three weeks.
The job is actually pretty good. I run the sick call
for the unit and do someother admin type things. Other
than that my time is pretty much my own. No call over
nifgt every third night at the hospital or some
asshole doctor chewing your ass about taking care of
patients. I still feel kind of out of the loop with
the other Marine officers but something tells me that
probably will not change. Likely, they look at me like
the friendly and tolerable neighborhood nerd who is
there to take care of the troops and give people light
duty chits. At least they leave me alone and give me a
chance to work out. The hills around Camp P are brutal
and unforgiving. I hope to be in good enough condition
in two-three more weeks to start running up the bigger
ones in the morning.
   That is about it. Wanted to say hello and defend
and deflect any artillery shells you and rat are
lobbing against me behind my back!!!!

Deregulation: `Conspiracy of Incompetence'
Even if energy prices are being manipulated, it may not be illegal

David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer 
STATE -- Profit-hungry power companies may be manipulating California's 
electricity prices, industry insiders say, but the attorney general will have 
a tough time finding a smoking gun in his price-fixing probe. Even if he does 
prove that electricity generators are ``gaming'' the market with a variety of 
price-influencing techniques, it's a whole other matter as to whether their 
actions violate the law. 
State legislators will attempt to shed some light on this murky matter during 
hearings today in Sacramento. 
What they will quickly discover is that power companies are having a field 
day as California muddles through deregulation of its electricity market. 
Among other things, power generators are said to be rigging electricity 
auctions and holding back juice until higher demand drives up wholesale 
prices, representing perhaps the single most glaring example of gaming, or 
price-fixing, the market. 
However, the generators aren't the only ones to blame for the current mess. 
``This has literally been a conspiracy of incompetence,'' said Michael 
Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San 
Diego grass- roots organization. ``Almost every player has made major 
mistakes or a series of mistakes.'' 
Utilities, he said, are also to blame for whopping price increases by 
mishandling power purchases. Meanwhile, state and federal regulators have 
demonstrated a virtually unwavering reluctance to weigh in and help stabilize 
electricity rates. 
At the same time, legislators themselves share some of the blame for 
California's energy woes by drafting rules for the deregulated market that 
are too easily bent, if not broken. 
``All the market participants are taking advantage of very lax rules,'' said 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission. ``The 
market is not competitive.'' 
As a stopgap, Gov. Gray Davis yesterday called on the PUC to cut San Diego 
electricity prices in half over the next two years, although he was vague on 
how this can be accomplished. 
1996 DEREGULATION 
When electricity deregulation was approved in 1996, the goal was to lower 
prices by boosting competition. 
In practice, however, only about a half-dozen power generators are now 
responsible for as much as three-quarters of the state's energy supply, and 
they can set prices pretty much as they see fit. 
Officials at the California Power Exchange, the wholesale market where power 
companies sell their juice and utilities go shopping, insist that they 
closely monitor all transactions. 
But they admit that it is impossible to know what may transpire among 
generators off the trading floor. 
``There are hundreds of ways that somebody could do it,'' exchange spokesman 
Jesus Arredondo said of whether price-fixing is possible. ``You could argue 
that it happens every day. 
``But I don't see how you could call this gaming,'' he said. ``You call it 
business.'' 
There's the rub. Although residents of San Diego, the first California city 
to feel the full effects of deregulation, have seen average power bills more 
than double over the past three months, power generators say this is simply a 
result of supply and demand. 
SUPPLY LIMITED, DEMAND RISING 
With supply severely limited -- no major power plants have been built in the 
state in a decade -- and demand rapidly rising, it is only natural, they say, 
that electricity prices would go through the roof. 
``It's a feast-or-famine business,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director 
of Menlo Park's Western Power Trading Forum, an energy industry group. ``You 
make a lot of money when times are good, and lose a lot of money when times 
are bad.'' 
At the moment, times are very good for power generators. An unusually hot 
summer has combined with a booming, tech-fueled economy to push California's 
power grid nearly to the breaking point on an almost daily basis. 
The question is: Are power companies benefiting from what are, for them, 
lucky circumstances, or are they making a bad situation even worse with 
practices that may not be illegal but still could be viewed as highly 
irresponsible? 
FOUR WHOLESALE MARKETS 
There are four major wholesale markets for electricity in California. The 
biggest is called the daily forward market, where generators and utilities 
meet each morning to buy and sell power on an hour-by-hour basis covering the 
next 24 hours. 
Electricity at times of expected low demand, such as 1 a.m., might go for as 
little as $25 per megawatt, while electricity during peak demand -- 3 p.m. to 
7 p.m. -- often sells for the maximum allowable amount, or $250 per megawatt. 
Longer-term contracts are negotiated on what is called the block forward 
market, where prices are more stable. 
But, industry sources say, power companies are increasingly focusing more on 
the hourly and real-time markets, where the potential for profit is greater 
than on the daily forward market because buyers have less room to maneuver -- 
they have to meet immediate demand. 
``Of course people are gaming the market,'' said Dan Richard, senior vice 
president of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. ``They know when to make bids and 
how to get what they want. Is that illegal? I honestly don't know.'' 
Brian Rahman, who oversees the real-time wholesale market on behalf of the 
California Independent System Operator, agreed that the legality of such 
moves has yet to be determined. 
``The power marketers know our rules,'' he said, ``and they use them to their 
benefit.'' 
Even so, Power Exchange officials said they will tell legislators today that 
their own study of wholesale electricity prices shows that California rates 
in June and July were in fact lower than in other states. 
``This makes it harder to make a case that market power is being exerted by 
power generators,'' said the exchange's Arredondo. ``It's exceedingly 
difficult to prove that there's market power.'' 
NO HEDGING IN SAN DIEGO 
Meanwhile, San Diego Gas & Electric has been accused of adding to electricity 
price volatility in the Southern California city by not securing long-term 
contracts for energy at a steady rate -- a process known as ``hedging.'' 
Instead, the utility exposed its customers to daily price spikes, which 
resulted in power bills surging skyward. 
``San Diego is bearing the brunt (of deregulation) for a couple of reasons: 
poor hedging and poor hedging,'' Arredondo said. 
For its part, PG&E has said it learned its lesson from San Diego and will 
make active use of hedging when its customers face the impact of 
deregulation, perhaps as soon as next summer. 
Davis called last week for Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate 
``possible manipulation'' in the wholesale electricity market. He also has 
asked federal regulators to rule that California's energy market is not 
competitive and to mandate ``just and reasonable'' rates. 
But regulators at both the federal and state levels so far have been 
reluctant to act, preferring instead to allow deregulation to run its course. 
For all these reasons, California's energy market has been especially 
vulnerable to exploitation by those who may not have consumers' best 
interests at heart. 
``The system of responsibility is fragmented,'' the PUC's Lynch said, ``and 
because it is fragmented, it allows various players to game the market.'' 
WHAT CAN BE DONE 
The solution? It depends who you ask. Most of those on the energy playing 
field believe that some degree of regulation is necessary to stabilize 
electricity prices, but no one yet knows how far legislators should go in 
drafting revised rules. 
Increased generating capacity will go a long way toward solving California's 
problems, but it will be years before enough new plants come online to bring 
supply and demand into balance. 
Today's hearings in Sacramento will presumably lay the groundwork for future 
initiatives. Although few if anyone knows how to fix things, everyone at 
least agrees that something -- anything -- needs to be done. 
``Government messes things up a lot of times, and the private sector messes 
things up a lot of times,'' said PG&E's Richard. ``But in the end, solutions 
emerge because it's just too important. That's the case now.''

Gov. Davis Calls for Cut in Electricity Bills
PUC under no obligation to heed unclear request 
David Lazarus, Lynda Gledhill, Greg Lucas, Chronicle Staff Writers
Thursday, August 10, 2000

U99453.DTL&type=business 
Gov. Gray Davis yesterday called on the California Public Utilities 
Commission to cut soaring San Diego electricity bills in half during the next 
two years. 
However, it was not clear how he expects the PUC to accomplish this goal or 
whether the commission will even heed the governor's request. Davis does not 
have the authority to order the PUC to act. 
``This is not a rate freeze,'' Davis told reporters in Sacramento. ``It is a 
rate-stabilization plan.'' 
It appears that what he has in mind is having San Diego Gas & Electric, the 
local utility, level out power bills by spreading its wholesale costs over 
longer periods. This would reduce customers' bills in the summer but raise 
bills at other times of the year. 
``This is an oraclelike document,'' Michael Shames, executive director of San 
Diego's Utility Consumers' Action Network, said after reading a press release 
outlining the governor's position. ``You can read almost anything into it.'' 
Calling electricity prices in San Diego exorbitant, Davis said he wants the 
PUC to reduce average residential power bills from the current level of about 
$120 a month to approximately $65. 
``Electricity is the pulse of our economy,'' he said. ``Without it, consumers 
and businesses are put at risk. California simply cannot afford any more 
price spikes or blackouts.'' 
Carl Wood, a Davis appointee on the PUC, said he believes the governor is 
seeking a so-called level pricing program for SDG&E customers. The PUC is 
empowered to order the utility to implement such a program. 
The utility itself already is urging ratepayers to adopt a similar pricing 
plan, thereby paying consistent electricity fees throughout the year. 
``We can't make the prices go away, but we can set up a system where the 
prices are level and deferred,'' Wood said. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said she will call a special meeting of the 
commission for August 21 to discuss the governor's proposal. 
Davis' comments came ahead of a joint hearing today at 10 a.m. on 
California's energy woes by the Senate and Assembly utilities committees in 
the Capitol Building. 
Also today, state Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado (San Diego County), and 
Assemblywoman Susan Davis, D-Kensington, are expected to introduce identical 
bills seeking to roll back electricity rates in San Diego to prederegulation 
levels. 
``We appreciate what the governor has done, but we feel there needs to be a 
parallel track in the Legislature where we find a solution for San Diego 
ratepayers,'' Alpert said. 
The governor said he will contact President Clinton and James Hoecker, 
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to urge them to 
expedite an investigation of California's wholesale electricity market. 
He also has called on Attorney General Bill Lockyer to probe suspected price 
fixing by power generators. 
``I believe in making a profit,'' Davis said. ``I believe in success. But 
charging seven, eight, nine times the price you pay for electricity is simply 
unconscionable. It's not fair to California. It will bring down our economy, 
and it augers very poorly for America.'' 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy said it may sail to the rescue in San Diego by 
bringing in its own electricity- generating equipment to keep its extensive 
bases in the area humming. 
The Navy is SDG&E's single biggest customer, drawing about 3 percent of the 
utility's total output. 
The Navy said in a statement that it is looking into transporting 10 
750-kilowatt generators from its facility in Port Heuneme to San Diego. 
For its part, the California Grocers Association said its members will reduce 
electricity usage by 10 percent during periods of unusually heavy demand. 
This could include lowering store lighting and cutting air conditioning at 
some supermarkets. 
``Although consumers may notice some differences while in their local 
supermarket, the energy-saving measures will not affect normal store 
operations,'' said Peter Larkin, president of the association. ``Also, none 
of these measures will have a negative impact on food safety or quality.''

Carl has been working with Enron and others and the ISO to develop a model 
that works for CA as well as for the Desert Southwest (which the ISO would 
then operate).  I think this summary explains the kinds of things were trying 
to get in congestion management reform.  I'll send a few other things to look 
at.

Subject: CAISO Congestion Model

Ziad:

Per our conversation this morning, attached is a summary of what I view to be 
the key attributes of a "reformed" zonal congestion model.  The document does 
not fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion 
reform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some 
details) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market 
participants are proposing.

This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who 
haven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be 
too far off.  

I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I 
offered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the 
ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process 
rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference 
between what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.  
(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the "hour-ahead" 
process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way 
scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative 
in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal 
counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real 
possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether 
integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will 
rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the 
models for the region.  

Carl

[Sue, Curt, Jim, Gary, Alex, Kent, Steven, John and Barney: I'd appreciate 
any feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to

 =DJ BIG PICTURE: Wider Econ Risks In California's Power Woes


    By John McAuley
    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Hot weather and a still-robust economy have
intensified
 electricity demand in the face of drum-tight power supplies in California,
the nation's
 most populous - and, in economic terms, most important - state.

 The resultant rolling "brown outs" and the potential for blackouts in the
future could have
 a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production in
California and even in
 the national statistics. Indeed, the impact is likely to be greatest in the
highest
 value-added sectors: computers and computer components, two industries that
have
 been a key engine of U.S. growth.

 Not only that, electricity generation is an important proxy in the Federal
Reserve's
 estimation of industrial production. So, the measurement of statistics
could be directly
 affected.

 About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial production
index is
 compiled on the basis of actual output volumes - tons of steel, boardfeet
of lumber, or
 millions of autos assembled, etc. For other forms of output, accounting for
about a
 quarter of the index, contributions to total production are estimated based
on hours
 worked data, with the implicit assumption that productivity - or the rate
of real output per
 labor hour - doesn't change much over short periods of time in these
industries. But the
 remainder of the index, about 26% according to a Fed economist, is
estimated using
 electricity generation measures.

 For this purpose, electricity generation is itself estimated from measures
of electric
 power usage by industry. Here, as with productivity, the technical
coefficient, or the
 amount of electricity input per unit of output, is assumed to be constant
over relatively
 long periods.


         As Usual, Things Are Different In California


 California power companies, as part of the deregulation of the electric
power industry,
 offer their business customers "interruptible rate plans". That means that
for a
 discounted rate, customers "voluntarily" allow the power company to
interrupt their
 power supply in times of peak demand.

 Too bad.

 The heat of summer combined with continuing strong economic activity has,
in fact,
 resulted in widespread interruptions throughout California.

 And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both a
statistical and real
 impact on production: the San Francisco earthquake of October 1989.

 That quake disrupted electricity generation, particularly south of the city
in Silicon
 Valley. Largely as a result of that disruption, national industrial
production declined by
 0.5% (0.6% in manufacturing) in October 1989.

 The computer and semiconductor chip producers in Silicon Valley and
elsewhere in the
 state are very heavy users of electricity. It is reasonable to expect that
their total
 consumption of electricity, and their output, have skyrocketed since 1989.

 This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy.


 First, chips are essential inputs to the production of other industries
from "smart chips"
 in cars to central processing units for computers. Thus, a bottleneck in
chip supplies
 because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyond
California.

 Second, chip production is among the highest value-added activities in the
U.S.
 economy - each stage of production adds significantly to the value of total
output. This
 means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatly
magnified
 effect on overall economic activity.

 The usage is not confined to chip production, however. An extensive range
of other
 California-based industries - from chemicals to textiles - have intensive
electricity usage
 in their production.

 Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction in
electricity. And in
 fact, real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input.

 Ironically, these interruptions could complement the Fed's efforts to slow
economic
 activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases. What
infuriates
 Californians might actually be a welcome development for the rest of us.

Sir,
 For the month of August, 2000, we will take 50% of our open Block Forward 
position financial instead of physical. We would like to make this change 
because we think the elimination of physical risk will benefit us 
commercially. Thus for bona fide commercial reasons, we will go financial 
with 50% of our open Block Forward position.

=DJ Calif Generators: `We Welcome Probe Into Power Market'  (This article
was originally published Tuesday)       By Jason Leopold     OF DOW JONES
NEWSWIRES    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--When California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer completes his investigation into possible "collusion" in the
wholesale electricity market by generators, energy companies say he will
probably find the same thing Geraldo Rivera found in Al Capone's safe:
nothing.  Still, those companies that own generation in the state say they
welcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
"We have done nothing wrong at all," said Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke
Energy North America (DUK). "Our plants have been running all summer long.
Prices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billion in new
generation and then try and rig the market."  For the past two months,
utilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations
that generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for
the price spikes.  Locker's office said an investigation is still pending.
State regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findings
of which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission by the end of the year.  Allegations Said Unsubstantiated  There
isn't a shred of evidence to support allegations, said Severing Borenstein,
director of the University of California, Berkley's, Energy Institute.
"There are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price for
power," Borenstein said. "Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in the
commodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.  "I
would say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge high
prices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. There
is no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... ."
The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as a
consequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay
market-based rates for electricity.  The high wholesale costs paid by
utility San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passed
on to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.  Gov.
Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own
investigation as well.  Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also says
that an investigation "will turn up nothing."  So why conduct one?  "This is
a very politically charged issue," Bergstrom said. "When something goes
wrong you have to find someone to point the finger at."  A source in the
governor's office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyer's
investigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis "has a responsibility to
his constituents."  Supply vs. Demand  What the investigation will turn up
is evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough
power plants being built to meet increasing demand, said Terry Winter,
chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System
Operator.  Winter said he doesn't believe that there is anything wrong with
the way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market works
well.  "Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)
knowing that you're 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that as
market power abuse," Winter said.  Despite some proposed regulatory changes,
such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&E
customers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) all
still plan to invest in generation in the state.  That's a different stance
than the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price
cap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.  "At the end of the day the market
is short power and you got to get people to build new generation," said
Dynegy's Bergstrom. "We got a big investment in California. We're not
walking away from that."  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;

12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers'
Complaint
(This article was originally published Tuesday)
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California's power grid administrator Monday urged
federal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking
compensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailed
during an extreme power grid emergency.
The independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a
"situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations,
and if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely."
The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the state's grid already
allows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried the
power producers' complaint as "a collateral attack" on a previous FERC order
rejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.
Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort
measure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ISO said.
The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of
interruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.
The ISO's objections were echoed by the state's electricity distribution
utilities and California regulators.
They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from
under the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in
skyrocketing power prices this summer.
The generators "knew when they purchased California power plants and when
they entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their
schedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it even
more expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ISO to maintain grid
reliability in California is irresponsible," said Southern California
Edison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).
"The complaint is a sham," declared the California Public Utilities
Commission.
"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps by
making sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, and
sell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators'
market power," the PUC said, calling for FERC to summarily reject the
complaint.
"The complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains of
conduct consistent with the ISO's authority under pertinent FERC decisions,
and seeks to avoid the price cap," the PUC said.
But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the
complaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy Power
Marketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).
"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price
of $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ISO
would be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market
participants who schedule energy for export," said the Electric Power Supply
Association, the national trade group representing competitive power
producers.
"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that the
curtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated,"
said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
"Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,
it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur
more frequently. Less energy will be imported into California and more
energy will leave California in search of higher prices," said Williams
Energy Marketing & Trading Co. in support of the complaint's call for actual
damages and lost opportunity costs.
At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers' position as
well.
"It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the
transactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the full
costs of doing so," said the Northern California Power Agency.

Jeff,
 Tim told me to put together a list of inormation we would want from the ISO. 
As a general rule, we want all information released. Here are some of the 
highlights:

1.  ETC schedules on each transmission line (both DA and HA). We want to see 
the ETC schedules at the same time they are submitted to the ISO on the 
following paths:
 a. path 15
 b. path 26
 c. nw1
 d. nw3
 e. az2
 f. az3
 g. lc1

2. Actual flows on each path. (real time flows)

3. How many mw's get cut on each path DA? i.e. how many mw's are adjustment 
bid out of the stack

4. Intrazonal Cong
 a. What paths have intra-zonal cong
 b. How many mw's flow, how many get cut on a DA/HA basis

5. BEEP stack

6. All load and generation bids DA by SC

7. Real time production from each plant

This Market Notification serves to advise you of the posting of the
Retro-Active November 16th - 30th 1999 UFE Market Adjustments resulting from
the ISO 1999 UFE Project results.  The June 20, 2000 Preliminary Settlement
Statement (PSS) contains the appropriate retro-active charge type
adjustments, specific to each participating SC.

This is the Seventh of Nine retro-active UFE adjustment to be processed, to
correct the UFE related settlement quality meter data (SQMD) problems
experienced commencing August 21st 1999 in the PG&E UDC Service Area, which
continued through December 31, 1999.

A copy of this ISO Project's final Report was previously distributed on June
15, 2000.

The UFE related market adjustments are reflected in Charge Types (CT)
111,112,114,115,116,402,403, 406, 1010,1011, 1030,1210.  GMC (CT 351) will
also be reconciled for those SC's which reported revised load, consistent
with any resubmitted UFE Project meter data.

The ISO will continue to monitor system UFE on a regular basis, conduct
periodic meter data audits, work with Market participants to help assure
SQMD,  and address any issues which arise.  Once again, our appreciation for
the Market's assistance to help assure an accurate UFE Market settlement and
for submission of SQMD!

Tim/Bob:

Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought 
ought to be made publicly available.  We're discussing how we can ensure that 
the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its 
"investigation" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.  Is there 
anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch 
(or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its 
investigation and that we ought to target for public release?  Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: CA ISO / CAL PX Information Related to 2000 Market Activity

We need to come up (very quickly) with a strategy on how to get the market 
information that will be important for FERC Investigation into the public 
arena.

I keep thinking that FERC can require the information and somehow get it made 
public right away.  

1. What information is not public that would be helpful?

2. What strategy will work to get FERC to take action?

Jim

i would categorize things in the following manner:

day ahead markets we want bid information (e.g., ancillary service markets, 
transmission markets, generation adjustment bids, load adjustment bids, 
import adjustment bids, export adjustment bids), initial preferred schedules, 
final schedules.
hour ahead markets we want the same thing.
real time market we want bid information, beep dispatch instructions.
after the fact we want actual meter information to get actual unit by unit 
production and load zone consumption.
per bob badeer, we want to see transmission information broken down between 
new firm use and existing transmission contracts.  we need adjustment bids, 
day ahead schedules, hour ahead schedules, real time adjustments, actual 
flows, and transmission availability by category of ownership (etcs, nfu).  
we want this for all transmission lines.
unit outage information.  planned outages and forced outages.
rmr calls.

Subject: information from iso

Jeff,
 Tim told me to put together a list of inormation we would want from the ISO. 
As a general rule, we want all information released. Here are some of the 
highlights:

1.  ETC schedules on each transmission line (both DA and HA). We want to see 
the ETC schedules at the same time they are submitted to the ISO on the 
following paths:
 a. path 15
 b. path 26
 c. nw1
 d. nw3
 e. az2
 f. az3
 g. lc1

2. Actual flows on each path. (real time flows)

3. How many mw's get cut on each path DA? i.e. how many mw's are adjustment 
bid out of the stack

4. Intrazonal Cong
 a. What paths have intra-zonal cong
 b. How many mw's flow, how many get cut on a DA/HA basis

5. BEEP stack

6. All load and generation bids DA by SC

7. Real time production from each plant

To Market Participants:

At the Market Issues Forum yesterday, Jeanne Sole led the presentation on
Distributed Generation, presenting the initial ISO thinking based on recent
proceedings and feedback from participants.   In the context of the CPUC
proceeding on distributed generation, the ISO has identified ISO
requirements that should be clarified or revised to accommodate distributed
generation.    The ISO has scheduled a meeting on August 31 , in Folsom,
from 10:30 AM -3 PM  to discuss its initial ideas on
clarifications/revisions. The ISO invites entities interested in discussing
these ideas and other ideas related to distributed generation to attend.  It
is our schedule now to take this issue to the Governing Board in October.

The ISO will distribute information on its initial ideas along with more
information on the location of the meeting by Friday August 18.

this compare to the other eight offers SDG&E has received?

=DJ Calif Generators: `We Welcome Probe Into Power Market'  (This article
was originally published Tuesday)       By Jason Leopold     OF DOW JONES
NEWSWIRES    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--When California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer completes his investigation into possible "collusion" in the
wholesale electricity market by generators, energy companies say he will
probably find the same thing Geraldo Rivera found in Al Capone's safe:
nothing.  Still, those companies that own generation in the state say they
welcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
"We have done nothing wrong at all," said Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke
Energy North America (DUK). "Our plants have been running all summer long.
Prices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billion in new
generation and then try and rig the market."  For the past two months,
utilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations
that generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for
the price spikes.  Locker's office said an investigation is still pending.
State regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findings
of which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission by the end of the year.  Allegations Said Unsubstantiated  There
isn't a shred of evidence to support allegations, said Severing Borenstein,
director of the University of California, Berkley's, Energy Institute.
"There are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price for
power," Borenstein said. "Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in the
commodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.  "I
would say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge high
prices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. There
is no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... ."
The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as a
consequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay
market-based rates for electricity.  The high wholesale costs paid by
utility San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passed
on to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.  Gov.
Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own
investigation as well.  Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also says
that an investigation "will turn up nothing."  So why conduct one?  "This is
a very politically charged issue," Bergstrom said. "When something goes
wrong you have to find someone to point the finger at."  A source in the
governor's office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyer's
investigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis "has a responsibility to
his constituents."  Supply vs. Demand  What the investigation will turn up
is evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough
power plants being built to meet increasing demand, said Terry Winter,
chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System
Operator.  Winter said he doesn't believe that there is anything wrong with
the way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market works
well.  "Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)
knowing that you're 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that as
market power abuse," Winter said.  Despite some proposed regulatory changes,
such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&E
customers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) all
still plan to invest in generation in the state.  That's a different stance
than the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price
cap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.  "At the end of the day the market
is short power and you got to get people to build new generation," said
Dynegy's Bergstrom. "We got a big investment in California. We're not
walking away from that."  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;

12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers'
Complaint
(This article was originally published Tuesday)
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California's power grid administrator Monday urged
federal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking
compensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailed
during an extreme power grid emergency.
The independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a
"situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations,
and if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely."
The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the state's grid already
allows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried the
power producers' complaint as "a collateral attack" on a previous FERC order
rejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.
Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort
measure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ISO said.
The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of
interruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.
The ISO's objections were echoed by the state's electricity distribution
utilities and California regulators.
They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from
under the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in
skyrocketing power prices this summer.
The generators "knew when they purchased California power plants and when
they entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their
schedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it even
more expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ISO to maintain grid
reliability in California is irresponsible," said Southern California
Edison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).
"The complaint is a sham," declared the California Public Utilities
Commission.
"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps by
making sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, and
sell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators'
market power," the PUC said, calling for FERC to summarily reject the
complaint.
"The complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains of
conduct consistent with the ISO's authority under pertinent FERC decisions,
and seeks to avoid the price cap," the PUC said.
But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the
complaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy Power
Marketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).
"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price
of $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ISO
would be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market
participants who schedule energy for export," said the Electric Power Supply
Association, the national trade group representing competitive power
producers.
"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that the
curtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated,"
said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
"Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,
it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur
more frequently. Less energy will be imported into California and more
energy will leave California in search of higher prices," said Williams
Energy Marketing & Trading Co. in support of the complaint's call for actual
damages and lost opportunity costs.
At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers' position as
well.
"It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the
transactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the full
costs of doing so," said the Northern California Power Agency.

It looks as though the budget language which would unwind the Commission's 
recent decision to allow competition with the Cal PX will be passed.  
Therefore, in the near term, the Cal PX is the only trading vehicle for the 
utilities.

Our lobbyists found NO support in the legislature to buck the language.  
Principally because the president of the Commission, Loretta Lynch, was the 
one seeking a legislative fix to unwind a decision that her agency issued.  
She had greased the skids with both the Republicans and the Democrats to 
support the language.  

So, as a result, the only thing that the Commission can do at this point is 
study the affects of introducing competition with the Cal PX and issue a 
report to the legislature by June 1, 2001.  Prior to that date, the 
Commission cannot implement any decision on this issue.  Effectively, by the 
time any change would occur, we could be at/or near the end of the transition 
period, when the mandatory buy/sell requirement would terminate.

We can encourage the Commission to study this issue and use the time as an 
opportunity to educate the Commission(ers) about Enron OnLine.  If there were 
perceptions that we would not qualify as an exchange, this would be a good 
time to dispel that bias.  Government Affairs would be happy to work with you 
in organizing such an event.

air energy storage facilities in a number of locations. Local utilities seem
encouraged by the idea as well. Read details at http://www.einsight.com.

In Energy Insight 2000 (Red Banner, premium-pay access only)
Montana Power's Touch America unit is expanding into wireless even as it
installs fiber optics across the country. The analysis is timely given
Montana Power's asset sale and Deutsche Telecom's further U.S. expansion,
both announced Monday.

News Briefs:

+Montana Power Sells Oil and Gas Business Unit
The Montana Power Co. has sold for $475million (US) its nonregulated oil and
gas business unit to PanCanadian Petroleum Limited of Calgary. The sale
includes subsidiaries that have interests in crude oil, natural gas and gas
liquids exploration, production and marketing in the U.S. and Canada.

Proceeds from the sale would be invested in growing Touch America, MPC's
national fiber-optic and wireless broadband telecommunications subsidiary.
The U.S. businesses have operations in northern Montana and in the D-J
(Denver-Julesburg) Basin north of Denver as well as minor properties in the
Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma, and Green River Basin, Wyoming. Fractionation
plants are at Cut Bank, MT, and Ft. Lupton, CO. The Canadian properties
reside mostly in southern and central Alberta and in southern Saskatchewan.

***********
+Deutsche Telekom to Buy Powertel for $5.89bn
The Financial Times said that Deutsche Telekom is expanding in the U.S.
mobile phone market by acquiring Powertel, a local mobile operator in the
Southeast, for about $5.89 billion in shares. The deal comes just weeks
after DT moved into the U.S. mobile market through the $50 billion
acquisition of VoiceStream.

As that deal has not yet been completed, the latest transaction is
structured as an all-share acquisition of Powertel by Voicestream. The two
U.S. companies have also agreed that the deal will go ahead even if DT's
takeover of VoiceStream is not completed.

Communications Holdings, Inc., a unit of SCANA Corp., owns approximately
14.6 million fully diluted
common shares, or about a 27% equity interest, in Powertel, representing an
investment of $249 million.

TSWG Meeting notes for 8/23/00


Participants:
Scheduling Coordinators - Altra, SCE, CDWR, PGE, Riverside, Southern,
Midway, Dynegy, PX, Reliant, NCPA, & more.
ISO - Darren Lamb, Ginger Seitles, Greg Ford, Eddie Ledesma, Mark Rothleder,
CP Ng, Jim Blatchford.

Settlement Dispute System (SDS):

Not implemented yet.

Automated Dispatch System (ADS):

The ADS Query File Data Dictionary was released this week. ADS client 26 was
released 8/23. Features include Query data which now contain decimals
instead of integer values and system performance improvement by limiting
queries to 7 days worth of data at a time. A question was raised about what
time standard is used for instructions. Greg Ford responded it is PDT/PST.

RMR Scheduling:

No comments

10-Minute Settlement:

The API parser had corrections made. The Ex-Post price fix (looking for 6
values instead of 1) has been implemented and is working. Also the
supplemental energy import parsing order was corrected. The Beep_Gen_Full
template does successfully parse through the existing parser. Ginger Seitles
is working with SCE to correct the localized parser problem. The question
was raised if there may be only one record supporting two charge types. CP
responded that for CTs 401/407 there is, and can be, one record supporting
multiple charge types. A question was raised concerning instructions being
over lapped to the next day. Mark responded that there are no instructions
that are issued to last over a day. Mark also reminded everyone that
effective June 1st that the ISO stated using ramping energy versus block
energy for dispatches. He also reminded all that residual energy would be in
effect on September 1st.  The PX asked if there were DC loss calculation
available for the market simulation information. CP stated that there was
and would forward it on to the PX. It is also planned to publish the
implementation schedule the week of 8/28.

InterSC Trades of Adjustment Bids:

The implementation target date for Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid has been
delayed until the first week of October 1, 2000. A new schedule has been
published. A training class has been tentatively scheduled for September
19th . Details to follow.

OASIS Redesign:

Darren Lamb explained that the project is progressing satisfactorily. He is
still anticipating a market testing in late October with full implementation
in mid-December. A concerned was raised about the amount of time, if any was
being allotted for overlapping of templates.

Dual Invoicing:

Everyone was reminded that the first preliminary invoices were coming out
8/24.

Other:

A request was made (after the TSWG call) to change the time of the call to
1330 PDT to accommodate those in the Eastern Time zone.  Comments are
requested.

Market Participants,

The California ISO  is initiating this Request for Bids in an effort to
obtain up to 3,000 MW of new generation resources to allow the ISO to
operate the ISO Control Area to meet Applicable Reliability Criteria under
peak Demand conditions during the Summer Period of 2001.

While the ISO seeks to acquire generation resources under this RFB through
one-year agreements, it will also consider bids that require an ISO
commitment for the Summer Periods of 2002 and 2003 if responses proposing
one-year arrangements prove insufficient to meet the ISO's requirements.

The RFB is attached to this email and posted on the ISO Web site at

http://www1.caiso.com/clientserv/stakeholders/


Inquiries regarding this RFB should be directed in writing or electronically
to Brian Theaker as noted on the first page of the RFB.

Craig Rose's article includes the price we offered to SDG&E -- thanks to 
Peace.  He makes us look like the bad guys in some respects -- at least he's 
saying let's try to make the market work first -- before asking the CPUC for 
price caps.

Market Participants,

Attention: Settlements and Scheduling Personnel

Your participation is requested in the second iteration of 10-Minute
Settlement Market Simulation.

As communicated on 7/20/00, the ISO has postponed the August 1, 2000,
implementation of 10-minute settlements in order to accommodate additional
end-to-end testing and market simulation.  The ISO's new target for
implementation is the last week of August, 2000, contingent upon the
successful completion of the second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation
and ISO's 10 day written notice to FERC.

The second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation is scheduled to begin on
Tuesday, August 1, 2000.  The ISO will hold a kickoff meeting conference
call on Thursday, July 27, from 1:30 - 3:00 p.m., to summarize the status of
the first Market Simulation, discuss the second Market Simulation logistics,
and review the Market Simulation Plan.

All Market Participants are strongly urged to participate in this simulation
to identify any outstanding issues that may affect implementation for
Scheduling Coordinators and the ISO.

Please respond to Cathy Young at cyoung@caiso.com by 3:00 p.m. on Friday if
you intend to participate.  The remainder of this message contains the
kickoff meeting Agenda, Market Simulation Schedule, and necessary system set
up documentation for the simulation.

Bob and Jeff, 

Attached is the list of counterparties who are striking our CAISO language in 
Confirmations along with the Counterparties who do not include the reference 
to CAISO on their confirmations (we actually attach an "Attachment A" with 
the CAISO language).

I would be grateful if you could begin having discussions with these 
counterparties on how CAISO is the product that EPMI buys/sells at the ISO in 
Ca. 

Many thanks,

Talked to Mark Hodge from the PX this morning regarding the charges on our 
statement.  He said that the daily block forwards transaction fee has been 
waived for July and Aug. (.02 transaction charge).  However, the tariff was 
changed on May 2nd that increased the settlement (aka clearing) charges to 
.03 per mwh per day.

I asked him why the daily block forwards are so expensive when we get the .01 
charge as a preferred customer on the term block forwards.  He said it's 
because of the costly bookout process.  I told him we do financial onlys, but 
not bookouts, and restated that .03 is more expensive than brokers.  He said 
that because the tariff filing of .03 was the maximum, these fees can be 
negotiated away from the .03 max., especially since we don't add to the costs 
of bookouts.   So, whoever among us is the queen or king of daily block 
forwards, or our block forward accounts in general, I suggest we do negotiate 
a lower rate on the daily schedules.

Both Brett and I tried to access the tariff on the PX website, but we

   Market Participants:
   When the ISO released its Congestion Management
Reform (CMR) Recommendation on July 11, we indicated that we would
subsequently release additional Appendices with supporting information on
Friday, July 21.  (Appendices A (Terminology and Acronyms) and B (Locational
Price Dispersion Study Results) were released on July 11 along with the
draft CMR Recommendation.)  Unfortunately, we are unable to complete them
according to schedule. We will release individual Appendices as they are
finalized, with the intention of releasing the following Appendices by
Friday, July 28:
    Appendix D (Assessment of CMR Recommendation
with Respect to Stakeholder Evaluation Criteria);
 Appendix E (Discussion of CMR Options not Adopted);
 Appendix F (Stakeholder Input for CMR Recommendation Package);
 Appendix G (Preliminary Assessment of ISO and Stakeholder System
Impacts); and
 Appendix H (Additional Forward Market RMR Cost Data Supporting LRA
Recommendations).
   We are planning to release Appendix C (Market
Separation Study Results) by August 15.
   We apologize for this delay and thank you for your
patience.

CalPX To Ask FERC To Reduce Day-of, Day-Ahead Price Cap:
Board Caves In To Political Pressure

By Jason Leopold

LOS ANGELES--The California Power Exchange, the spot market where electricity 
is
bought and sold in the state, approved a measure Wednesday seeking federal
authority to impose a
$350 per megawatt-hour bid cap on wholesale power prices in its day-of and
day-ahead markets.

Members of the CalPX's board of governors admitted that the measure was 
approved
 as a result of
intense political pressure being placed on the board by state lawmakers and 
Gov.
 Gray Davis.

"Not approving this is political suicide," said CalPX board member Carolyn
Keherein, who also serves
on the board of governors at the California Independent System Operator. 
"We're
not changing
anything but the perception in the market."

The CalPX current cap on wholesale power prices in the day-of and day-ahead
market is set at $2,500,
but that is only a technical limitation of their computer system and has had 
no
effect on power prices.

State lawmakers believe a price cap would stabilize high power prices being
passed on to retail
customers, most notably consumers in San Diego. Ratepayers there are paying
market-based rates for
electricity and have seen their utility bills nearly triple in the past two
months.

The price cap would need to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission before it goes
into effect at the Power Exchange. FERC has not indicated whether it would OK
the measure, but said
it would investigate it.



If you have any questions, please feel free to call me directly.

 DJ Clinton To Direct Govt To Help Calif On Electricity Woes

 WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--U.S. President Bill Clinton will direct federal
agencies
 Wednesday to provide financial assistance to low-income families and small
 businesses in Southern California to help them cope with high electricity
bills, the White
 House said in a written statement.

 Clinton also ordered the release of $2.6 million from the Low Income Home
Energy
 Assistance Program to help low-income families in Southern California. The
Small
 Business Administration will urge its lending partners to use SBA credit
programs to
 help small businesses with their energy costs.

 Clinton is taking the action because of a steep rise in the wholesale price
of electricity,
 the statement said.

 In addition, Clinton has called on Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to ask
the Federal
 Energy Regulatory Commission to speed up an investigation into the bulk
market for
 electricity "so that state and federal regulators and policy makers can
have the
 information they need to protect consumers in a timely fashion."

 Clinton's actions marks the second time this summer the president has
stepped in to
 help California cope with its electricity shortages. Earlier, Clinton
called on all federal
 facilities in California to cut their power usage and to direct power back
into the
 electricity grid.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

MARKET NOTICE
This Market Notification is to advise you of a misallocation of UFE that has
been identified in the SCE and Pasadena's UDC territories between the Trade
dates of April 27, 2000 and June 27, 2000 .
On April 26, 2000 the ISO made a change to the ISO Masterfile that
eliminated the ability for SCs to submit a schedule at the intra-tie
resource ID for the Pasadena UDC territory. This change in turn, prevented
the meter data that was directly collected by the ISO at the intra-tie/load
point to be used in the Settlement calculations.
The effect of this change was that from Trade date April 27, 2000 until
corrected for Trade date June 28, 2000 the UFE calculation was performed
without the proper data representing the intra-tie point between the SCE and
Pasadena UDC territories. This caused UFE to be more positive in the SCE UDC
territory and more negative in the Pasadena UDC territory.  The UFE
calculation used the appropriate meter data, for Trade dates June 28, 2000
forward .
The ISO is in process of determining the method to reallocate the UFE for
the period between Trade dates April 27, 2000 and June 27, 2000. The
magnitude of the misallocation is estimated at approximately $14.5 Million .

Further notification to the Market will be made after the ISO determines the
reallocation method and timeline .

News Brief

+High Cost of Oil and Natural Gas Puts FPL $518 Million Behind in Fuel
Expense Recovery

Faced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy seasonal demand
for electricity, Florida Power & Light Company has filed preliminary
paperwork with the Florida Public Service Commission identifying $518
million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricity
in 2000. FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission to
recover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.

Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that is
currently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund is
pursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the Public
Counsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and its
customers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years. As a
result of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residential
electric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.

The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since the
first quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.
Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. Natural gas
prices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000. With the
onset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand for
heating fuel increases.

Subject: DJ Rising Electricity Prices Could Be Wild Card In July CPI 




16:55 GMT 11 August 2000 =DJ Rising Electricity Prices Could Be Wild Card In
July CPI

   By Henry J. Pulizzi
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Now that gasoline prices are finally settling down,
economists say another energy component could prove to be a spoiler on the
government's main consumer inflation gauge.
Amid a shifting regulatory landscape and typical summertime price increases,
the nation's utilities appear to be boosting consumers' electricity bills
enough to skew the Labor Department's July consumer price index. Those gains
would partly offset the anticipated favorable influence of recently
declining gas prices.
"There is a real chance of starling increases in electricity prices over the
next month or two, thanks mostly to the bungled deregulation of the
industry," Ian Sheperdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics
in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a recent report. "All the anecdotal evidence
from the West and East Costs suggests consumers are reeling from sudden
double - and in some cases triple - digit percentage increases in their
bills."
First Union economist Mark Vitner agreed: "It is a potential trouble spot,
it is a particular problem in the West." In California, where no new power
plants have been built in a decade, the private companies that purchased
plants from the state's utilities have been raising prices in response to
strong demand and dwindling supply.
The impact of the cost increases will be revealed Wednesday, when the Labor
Department releases the July CPI next Wednesday.
Economists generally expect the figures to point to a continued tame
inflation scenario - a 0.1% overall monthly increase, featuring declining
clothing, computer and gas prices is forecast. Labor Department economist
Patrick Jackman said recent statistics suggest gas prices fell 3% to 3.5%
last month. That would mark a departure from June, when soaring prices at
the nation's gas stations contributed to a big 0.6% spike in the CPI.
Rising Demand, Surging Prices
But electricity, which represents 2.5% of the entire index, will be a wild
card in the coming report.
Electricity costs usually rise in the summer as consumers pay more for the
juice that powers their air conditioners. This summer is no different,
Vitner said, adding that utilities have even more pricing power than normal.

"Overall demand for electricity has been rising. All this high-tech
equipment uses a lot of electricity," Vitner said.
Indeed, prices rose 0.8% in June after seasonal adjustments. Before those
adjustments, prices surged a whopping 6.6% during the month.
As for a July increase, Jackman said "it certainly is a possibility. The
question is how are the seasonal factors are going to handle it."
Sheperdson, however, believes it's clear that electricity costs are on the
rise. "Three factors are driving prices higher," he said. "First, flaws in
the auction system set up after deregulation effectively allow the
generating companies to manipulate prices at times of high demand. Second,
the economic boom means that periods of high demand are much more common
than was anticipated at the time of deregulation, so generators have more
opportunity to extract premium prices from distributors and, hence,
consumers. Third, little new electricity-generating capacity has been added
in recent years."
Producer prices, which Sheperdson says provide a good guide to movements in
the CPI, may offer ominous insight into the potential consumer electricity
price gains. Residential electric power prices on the producer level rose
faster in July than at any point since January 1991.
And they aren't expected to slow down anytime soon. August could be
especially problematic because higher electricity costs will coincide with
another pickup in gas prices and continued gains in natural gas prices,
Vitner said.
"We have no idea how far the CPI measure of residential electricity prices
could rise, but there must be a good chance that substantial increases will
be recorded," Sheperdson said. "With natural gas prices also climbing again,
following a dip in July, it may take a while before energy ceases to push
inflation higher."

Further to your letter to us (addressed to Mr. Tim Belden)  dated August 14, 
2000:  

Enron thinks that the elimination of physical risk during the month of August 
will be of commercial benefit because Enron expects that during the month of 
August there will be transmission line derations affecting the hour ahead 
market which will lead to TO debit charges by the CAISO.   The elimination 
of  TO debit charges is a commercial benefit to Enron.

THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

Everyone is getting into the act.  When I started this gig, I was the
only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in
California.  I wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all the
important stuff.  This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write his
own Burrito.  His epistle got more press than mine, but why is he
muscling in on my turf?  Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynch
released a report which looks into every facet of California?s power
business.  No stone left unturned. I?m telling you, there isn?t enough
room in this business for all of us.  They need to clear out.

With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis
and Let?s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?  They re-define our
reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.  For example, starting in
early June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against other
Qualified Trading Vehicles.  Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrer
legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at
least one year.  This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for
PG&E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculating
the PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom.

I can?t wait to see what next week will bring.  I hear Senator Bowen is
holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and the
Governor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things:

What?s for lunch?
Who will sit at the head of the table?
Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention?
Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry?
Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?  It?s getting too
warm.

Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena,
ignore the facts, and publish a report.  It makes one want to take a
deep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.

You know, I can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere.

>>> Things on the Island of California
 @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?

Well, the answer very clearly is no.  I have been astounded by repeated
attempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead they
mimic apes.

Consider the following.  First, they waltz their default customers into
the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the
wholesale market.  Forgivable in that it is human to err.  The prices
skyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame.  _Must be
them damn independent generators,O say their managers.  Gary Cotton
informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in the
Block Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference.  There?s one
nobel laureate who missed his prime.

Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else
who will assist the utility and their customers.  Nine offers show up at
their table, and they can?t choose any of them.  Again, Mr Cotton tells
his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, and
we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well,
the surfing was good this week so why spoil it?

Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies
living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&E
electricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.
SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that
SDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills,
including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can help
by calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] and
urging them to lower the cap.  I always thought the location of the ISO
was a State secret for security reasons.  No secrets in San Diego.

But we are not done.  No sir, we are not.  Those buffalo heads who run
that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective
foreheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the
Electric Oversight Board.  The one they pick is to petition FERC on an
expedited basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bid
energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX.  The primary
reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive.  In
other words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can
sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy!

What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E
continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run
energy into the PX.   These are sales from their stranded assets.  Their
grief hasn?t abated their greed.

So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to win
consumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers
and did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale price
because the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy
is not workably competitive.  Too much time in the direct sun light.

>>> Things on the Island of California
 @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report

The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent
enough time.  I only read the Executive Summary, and that only because
our counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some of
the gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito.  I would recommend
reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse
entertainment.

_California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and
pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten
years.

_ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California have
increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting in
over $1 billion in excess   payments for electricity.

_Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and
dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined
to drive prices up ...

_Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity,
purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in
electricity costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do not
necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery
reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins.

_Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to
oversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data.
Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior
exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into
these statewide market practices, coordinating with other State
agencies, including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation would
provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and
regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits.

_A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in
electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's
electric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly
at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the
extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C.
now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power
plants.

_Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the
federal government combined with the legislative creation of two
non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the
public or consider the retail customer. The "Independent System
Operator" (ISO) and the "Power Exchange" (PX), the nonprofit private
corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control
wholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members can
have serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or their
companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets.
Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or
its consumers ....


_Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's
electric services, the State of California should protect its businesses
and consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power
plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity
supplies.

_California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San
Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential
service like electricity will double. California is now largely
constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail
price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If California
tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulators
would likely prevent that action.  ... Short-term price relief, however,
cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems
controlled by federal regulators.

 _We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if
the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several
fronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering and
bidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry into
national pricing and energy market issues. California should not wait
for national findings before it investigates California market
practices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately
subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering
behavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its board
members; and the actions of generators in supplying California's energy
needs.

_Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity
Problems From Spreading in 2001: ...



     2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National
     Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy
     problems and to perform integrated energy planning;

     3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to
     moderate California wholesale market pricing;

     4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and
     western regional markets and find that no competitive market
     exists in California power markets;


...


      8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX
     stakeholder boards;

     9. Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generator
     data and enhance the State's enforcement capability for power
     plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming,
     consistent with protection of proprietary business
     information;

     10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and
     additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX.

_Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ...


     4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent
     with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications
     to advance clean, BACT+ power plant proposals.

     5. Institute "use-it -or- lose-it" permitting power plant
     licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants
     get built;

     ...

      8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower
     wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO

I told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore.  The Democrats in
Sacramento are doing that for me.  Welcome comrade.

>>> Things on the Island of California
 @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!

It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board
meeting, especially when our favorite topic arises.  It seems the only
time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the
agenda: price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements.
Otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum.

%Round and %round we went, once again.  A few more forced votes tipped
the scale in favor of the cap.  There were 15 yes votes, which included
a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of
Energy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters of
your name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO?  Kind of a french
thing.] I?m sorry about that vote, Jerry.  You still go in my book as
one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation
for so long.  Your picture in the SF Chron said it all.

The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet
(Enron), Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), Caolyn
Kehrein (CMA), Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble).
Now, I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No,
spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO.   I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis
in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem.  We?re going to
work things out.

The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board, again.  I didn?t mind that I only
had a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and Herr
(Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes.  That didn?t bother me at all.  He
did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2.  He blasted away
at everyone who opposed him.  He pined about Camden quitting the Board.
He said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way those
academic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the gods
of competition.  He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect
fish and wildlife (what was that all about?).  He predicted that on
Thursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats,
Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC
impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just
and reasonable (it didn?t happen).  And on and on and on.  This man is
very delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can save
the world.  He believes that political will trumps judicial,
quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions.  This man makes relevant
all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche
(1844-1900) ... The will to power, the ?bermensch, the transvaluation of
values, etc.

But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press.
Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he
thought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over.
Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would not
come to the meeting.  Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, and
all of it bad.

That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step
away from our front door.

 >>> Things at the throne of FERC
 @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order

And now, the good news.  You deserve this.  FERC gave the California
market a little wiggle room last Friday.  FERC issued a last minute
reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the
ISO?s intent to lower the price cap.  FERC denied the complaint, but
they didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint.  FERC
danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap.

Here are some excerpts:

_We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers?
prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market
by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to
pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to
sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere...

_ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy
than any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable to
elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price
ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose),
it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet
its needs. ... Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls for
generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability.  Because the
current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, the
resulting overall payments may be higher.

_To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a
directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets
under any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), such
a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ...
Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a
requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO
market rules.  Such market changes could not become effective absent a
corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed
under section 205 of the FPA.O

Well. What do you think about that?

Just wait.  Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said in
his concurring remarks:

_Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin
a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the
California grid.  The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum to
the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board
eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the
independence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines
consequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.?

_Because these allegations come from a non-market participant,
especially should we take heed.  We must also take notice of the public
pressure on the Board to compromise its independence.O

Amen, brother, amen.

>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)

As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks before
this has been interminable.  I get about three phone calls a day from
press reporters, very little of which ever sees print.  My shtick is
just too complex for casual readers.  But I do notice that the reporters
are asking better questions.  The public is becoming more savvy.  The
information flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces of
evil, in about 10 years.

I have other problems on my mind.  I am working on a new computer
system.  Really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit
faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully.  As a
result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my office
looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computer
documentation, and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess.

Prepare for the future.  Our next general meeting is scheduled for
Thursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay.  Barb Ennis will
prepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations,
timing, golf, etc.  Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman
Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms.
Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a
presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, and
William Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us some
education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO.

Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass.  Last week
we had a joke about Catholics.  This week it?s agnostics.
=====================
An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that the
accident  of evolution had created.  "What majestic trees!  What
powerful rivers! What  beautiful animals!"  he said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes
behind him.  As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear
charging  towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path.  He
looked over his  shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.
He tried to run even  faster, so scared that tears were coming to his
eyes. His heart was pumping  frantically as he tried to run even faster,
but he tripped and fell on the  ground.  He rolled over to pick himself
up and saw the bear right on top of  him raising its paw to kill him.

At that instant he cried out "Oh my God!" And time stopped. The bear
froze.  The forest was silent.  The river even stopped flowing.  A
bright light shone  upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, "You
deny my existence all  these years, teach others I don't exist and even
credit my creation to a  cosmic accident, and now do you expect me to
help you out of this  predicament?  Am I to count you as a believer?"

The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, "It would be
rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these
years,  but could you make the bear a believer?"

"Very well" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed,
the  sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both paws
together,  bowed his head, and said, "Lord, I thank you for this food
which I am about  to receive."
==================

Amen.  And have a great weekend.  Oh, and thanks to all of you who sent
me happy birthday wishes.  It was very much appreciated.

Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a 
printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc

For more information on the Chairman's Award, including details on last 
year's Roundtable members and previous winners, Repit Suliyono and Bobbye 
Brown, please click here: http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom

Again, this is a very special award at Enron and we sincerely thank you for 
your participation.

  Market Participants:

  The ISO has posted the following materials regarding CAISO's
Congestion Management Reform (CMR) Recommendation.

  Congestion Management Reform Recommendation (This is the
same as the version posted on July 11th with the exception that we have
corrected typographical errors.)

  Appendix A - Terminology and Acronyms A glossary of various
terms and acronyms used throughout the CMR Recommendation package.

  Appendix B - Locational Price Dispersion Study Summarizes
the areas of empirical study in which the ISO is currently engaged and
describes the objective, design, and preliminary results of the ISO's
analysis of the dispersion of locational prices throughout the ISO control
area.

  Appendix D - Assessment of CMR Design Recommendation with
Respect to Stakeholder Evaluation Criteria Compares the CMR Recommendation
against the specific evaluation criteria agreed to by the ISO and Market
Participants at the first stakeholder meetings.

  Appendix E - Congestion Management Redesign Options Not
Adopted in the CMR Recommendation

  Appendix G - System Impacts Summarizes the anticipated
impact of CMR Recommendation on the ISO's primary systems, such as SI/SA,
BBS, FTR, EMS, etc.  The purpose of this appendix is not to provide detailed
cost-benefit evaluation of the proposal, which we believe would be entirely
subjective and of little value.

  Appendix H - Intra-Zonal Congestion Management Mitigation
Costs During 1999  and Their Application to Local Reliability Areas.

  It is our intent to publicly distribute Appendix C, as
identified below, by mid August.  In the final draft of
  the recommendation package, to be publicly distributed and
provided to the Board in late August, we will
  provide the following additional appendices as well as
updated versions of those identified above.

  Appendix C - Market Separation Study The objectives, design,
and preliminary results of the other ongoing study being undertaken in
connection with the Congestion Management Reform process.

  Appendix F - Summary of Stakeholder Comments of California
ISO Congestion Management Proposals A summary of all stakeholder comments
received to date on the various proposals and concepts incorporated into
this recommendation package.

  You can find these Appendices along with the original
proposal and feedback form  at

15:13 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Exceeded $250 Cap In Off-system Buys
-Sources 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator had to pay
more than its stated maximum price of $250 a megawatt-hour this week due to
short supplies of electricity in the western U.S. amid high air-conditioning
demand, according to market sources.
Under its price cap rules, the ISO is allowed to exceed its cap in
"out-of-market" purchases, which is when it purchases power in deals
arranged directly with sellers over the phone, rather than through its usual
computer-based purchasing system. The current cap was lowered to $250/MWh
from $500/MWh starting August 7.
The ISO wouldn't confirm that it had to pay more than $250 Monday.
"We're not going to reveal whether this is happening, or at what price,"
spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkel told Dow Jones Newswires. "For the sake of
protecting consumers, we will keep our price strategy confidiential. But any
out-of-market purchase above the cap is very rare."
On Sunday, the ISO agreed to pay about $350/MWh at Palo Verde to a southwest
utility for on-peak Monday power, according to a trader for the utility, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bilateral trades not involving the ISO
were done as high as $375/MWh Monday afternoon in the real-time market.
Other market sources said that the ISO exceeded its cap again Tuesday
afternoon, when several major California generating units were be taken off
line for unplanned repairs, and the real-time market rose to $500/MWh for
one hour at Palo Verde. Those purchases couldn't be confirmed with sellers.
According to its price cap rule, "Such reduced cap shall not apply to
out-of-market calls placed by management to out-of-state generator
resources."
Some market participants say that regular out-of-market purchases above
$250/MWh could persuade suppliers to not offer power to the ISO via its
computer-based system, which has plateaued at $250/MWh for most of both
Monday and Tuesday afternoons.
And owners of generating stations in California say there is no
justification for giving preferential treatment to out-of-state generators.

  Market Participants:

  After yesterday's announcement of CMR stakeholder meeting
schedule changes, we learned of a conflict with previously-scheduled
meetings on August 15 that affected many of you who have been active in the
CMR process.  As a result, we have rescheduled the stakeholder meetings to
discuss details of the CMR Recommendation for August 16-18.  We give you
specifics of these meetings as soon as they are available.

THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=0F't know if it=0F's wishful
thinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale
summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=0F's premature, I know.  A few
fallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows
... I=0F'm jumping the gun.  I can=0F't wait for this summer to be over,
especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the din
of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, I
can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires in
Montana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipeline
in New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,
depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for
commercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting imports
of Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buying
about 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position.

 I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the
California restructured power industry.  I just want to end to the
summer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even in
Cleveland.

There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect of
the wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,
but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=0F's
request.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State Attorneys
General has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-state
generators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=0F't have
an ongoing study of the California Market, then you=0F're not hip.

All of these investigations, save FERC=0F's Section 206 Investigation, are
going to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  The
PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Now
they need some evidence to support their assertions.

And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talk
to many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.
I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, and
anyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You want
to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is
making things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, are
damnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of those
people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price
shocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.

The public isn=0F't going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.
And let=0F's face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, our
industry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.
Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every
turn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=0F' bill, =0F"Here is what
you would have paid if the rate freeze ended ....=0F".  But many of us in
the new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gas
industry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the best
response to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of an
angry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shall
pass.

I don=0F't buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=0F't
believe we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  What
electric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,
and in everyone=0F's best interests.  Look at it this way, when they pat
the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do you
most want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will of
others, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was right
instead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit laced
with sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids
(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture and
not just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So join
me and stand up for what you believe.  They can=0F't take away your pride,
not yet.

Here is this week=0F's line up.

 @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F's Order on SDG&E Complaint

President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San
Diego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are making
choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I call
this the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC to
investigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.

In response to SDG&E=0F's August 2 complaint, whereby the utility asked
FERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERC
responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  The
FERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERC
also initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale power
market in California.

Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERC=0F's Order:

=0F"In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E's requested immediate
imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we are
instituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206
of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness
of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and
ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to also
investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws
of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient
operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California
and need to be modified

=0F"SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if
sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that
would prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid and
receive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E also
argues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices and
the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that
the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.

=0F"While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing on
these issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh as
requested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support such
an action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint are
important, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E's proposal
to place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that every
public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the
PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided no
evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise
market power, has not documented a single instance of a seller
exercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt to
show that the conditions underlying the Commission's approval of
market-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary
services have changed.  Nor did it address specific market or
institutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or
unreasonable.

=0F"SDG&E asserts that the ISO's congestion management and market
structures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&E
expresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestion
management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders
will not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it is
prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;
however, SDG&E's complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, in
SDG&E's judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.

=0F"Various interveners contend that SDG&E's arguments are premature. ...
We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subject
of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.
Accordingly, we reject SDG&E's arguments at this time.

=0F"It is unclear whether SDG&E's failure to purchase hedging instruments
for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its
business decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the
volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly when
consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price
signals.

=0F"We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in the
real-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns.
...  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources
needed for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practice
put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last
minute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchases
are not subject to the ISO's  buyer's cap.  Furthermore, because the ISO
is the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls are
made, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.

=0F"In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediately
institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary
to reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipate
the need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peak
periods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of
the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this
analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price
cap authority.=0F"

In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be very
active in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing of
briefs, and reply briefs.

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product

Several weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing
a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the
morning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.
I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market
instead of the ISO doing the same.

At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTF
position that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Board
insisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do what
ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3
alerts.  Whereas I didn=0F't think about the conversation on super-peak
block markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the Governing
Board, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and should
work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the
California PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out
of Market system.

This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides
discussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and how
it could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had many
of its members who either have generation in the State, or import power
into California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how
to bring more order and price transparency to the ISO's out of market
calls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of money
spent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year the
total cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.

APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,
presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensued
during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might
utilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currently
needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on short
notice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids
into either the APX or CalPX's proposed system for a super-peak
firm-energy product.

There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness to
work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding
sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater
transparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.

We=0F'll keep you posted on our development of this market.

>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response

Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as I
did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story
called the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like to
share. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that there
are other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sent
to Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.

Michael wrote:

=0F"I'm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [the
Gow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simpler
times, people knew the other people that they did business with, and
they typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried to
charge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only one
in town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of his
fellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such
behavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones that
the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would not
be a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did not
happen.

=0F"In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doing
business has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  I
have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,
I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the end
results of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can't
afford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimly
perceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social
program, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.

=0F"This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because both
scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  But
certainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better in
my view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of
every transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one is
responsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want to
live in???

=0F"PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVEN
BLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE
AGE.      Deut=0F"

Okay.  It=0F's in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.

You allude to the change in a world that was once =0F"more personal=0F" and=
 is
now institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off if
for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But I
don=0F't think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It is
ever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces the
impersonal =0F"efficiencies=0F" when it is convenient.  Finally and most
importantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterparts
be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which might
happen in a handful of years?

However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe that
there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in
California.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your
response.

First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  I
exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my
consulting engagements which require financial give and take between
client and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have been
the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in
my checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedly
late, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,
and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the
use of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all the
efficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharing
of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the
initial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the risk
arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.

I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it has
done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in
the ISO=0F's congestion management reform.  Elimination of market
separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to
execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the
name of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it really
matter if it is done through person to person transactions, or through
markets?

Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  What
happens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next town
down the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant of
Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater
inventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  The
corollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literally
billions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  It
paid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably will
next year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants under
construction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction in
Arizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects in
California, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits
will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  The
prices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want to
know, where will today=0F's accusers be when there is a shake out?
Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But the
alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.
You gotta make hay while the sun shines.

Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you to
develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial
customers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higher
electricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=0F't tested the idea
with any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possibly
secured by the credit of participating generating companies, and
executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.
Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.
It=0F's simply smart business, not charity.  It=0F's one way to amortize th=
e
earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative
to the sudden growth of demand for power.

Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=0F't know. One could
argue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level payment
plan for it=0F's consumers.  True, it is no different, because in either
case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative
fees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more
efficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by a
monopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by parties
other than the utility=0F's customers.  Further, we wouldn=0F't have to wor=
ry
about PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this work
quickly.

I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of my
members.  Thanks for sending us your letter.

 @@@ Finish the Story Contest

Well, there was only one response, and that was from Carl Imparato.
Here is what Carl said,

=0F"Am I missing something? Who is Gow-Jing supposed to represent? (Yes, I
get the pun in the name.  But is he also just an anonymous "everyman" or
is there someone in particular?)

=0F"My first response to your question is that Gow-Jing simply replies
=0F`Itai!=0F' (You could look it up... I think it's Chinese for =0F`it hurt=
s!=0F').
Then he takes out a concealed axe, goes on a rampage and kills
everyone.  But that's too realistic, so don't use that ending.  Instead:


=0F"Ending:  Just as he was about to reply, a giant 500 foot wall of water
swept through the room, drowning everyone.  And they lived happily ever
after.  The end."

I haven=0F't decided whether to name this response Carl=0F's Gilgamesh Epic
(I.e., Noah and the flood), or Carl=0F's Hydro Dream.  We=0F'll leave the
contest open for another week.  Can=0F't let $5 bucks go the only entry.

 @@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?

Dan Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item. Houston,
the unofficial home of the electric power industry, is a town you either
love or hate.  Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber
of Commerce of the 4th largest city to enable their many visitors to
cope.

=0F=07   First you must learn to pronounce the city  name. It is YEWS-TUN a=
nd
it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places.

=0F=07   Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Houston has its ow=
n
version of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown Houston is composed
entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of center of town
is to
turn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.

=0F=07   All directions start with, "Go down  Westheimer..."

=0F=07   Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

=0F=07   It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street  yo=
u
started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a "scenic  drive".

=0F=07   The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am. The 5:00 pm rush hour is
from 3:30 to 6:30 pm.  Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.

=0F=07   If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston=
.

=0F=07   Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native, so do not
attempt the phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads
to the right and stare at you.

=0F=07   Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanent
form of entertainment.

=0F=07   Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase=
,
" Oh, we're in Montrose!!"

=0F=07   Construction crews aren't doing their job properly  unless they
close down all lanes except one during rush hour.

=0F=07   If  someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably lef=
t
on at the factory where the car was made.

=0F=07   White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a=
ny
known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop
signs.

=0F=07   All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln
Continentals have the right of way.

=0F=07   The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a  legal right to
turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right  lane. YOU HAVE
BEEN WARNED!

=0F=07   Buying a  Houston street map is a waste of money since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to
avoid major road construction.

=0F=07   Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled
environment for their own safety.

=0F=07   Sir" and "Ma'am" are used by the person speaking to you if there's=
 a
remote  possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are.

=0F=07   "Sugar" is a more common form of  address than "Miss". So is
"Honey". Do not take offense. This is how southerners address grown
women.

=0F=07   In Houston we drink Coca-Cola  and Dr. Pepper. It is rumored that
other soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to knowing anyone
who actually drinks them.  So don't ask for any other soft drink.

=0F=07   What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental
Airport: Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the Main
Concourse of any terminal.  Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes
are advised.

=0F=07   Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic. The bumper
sticker that reads, "Keep honking, I'm reloading" is considered fair
warning.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Have a great weekend, y=0F'all.

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The ISO has posted the CPUC subpoena on its website at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf>   As stated
in a message forwarded yesterday to market participants and scheduling
coordinators, the CPUC has agreed to extend the deadline for a reply to
Friday July 28, although the ISO has been informed today that the extension
is only until NOON on Friday.  In addition, the ISO discussed the reference
to an affidavit in the subpoena with the CPUC and was informed that this
results from a typo which will be corrected in a corrected document sent by
federal express to the ISO yesterday (the words attached affidavit will be
replaced with the word attachments).  The ISO has accepted federal express
service of the subpoena.

The ISO has raised confidentiality concerns with the CPUC and the CPUC
agreed to circulate a draft of a confidentiality agreement to the ISO today.
The ISO will forward the draft to market participants and scheduling
coordinators as soon as we receive it.  Once again the ISO reiterates to
market participants that to the extent they have outstanding issues as to
the subpoena, these should be raised directly with the appropriate entity.
The ISO intends to comply with the subpoena on Friday unless it receives a
legally sufficient communication to the contrary from the CPUC or a court.

Finally, a few market participants have requested that the ISO make
available several letters forwarded to the EOB discussing confidential
treatment.  These letters are attached.

Questions should be directed to Jeanne M. Sol, at 916-608-7144.

  Market Participants
  SC Settlements Contacts

  After the 10 Minute Settlement Market Simulation conference
call on Friday August 25,  Market Participants' concerns of readiness were
brought before the ISO Officers.  The Officers discussed these concerns as
well as the two previous delays (June and August) in implementing Ten Minute
Settlements.  Weighing all of these issues, the ISO believes that there is a
compelling need to put a pricing structure in place to realize a substantial
saving in real time energy costs.

  Therefore, the ISO has decided to continue with the Ten
Minute Settlement implementation date of September 1, 2000.

  Market Participants:
  The CAISO has posted its draft Congestion Management Reform
(CMR) recommendation on its web site at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html> . This document
recommends changes to the CAISO's current Congestion Management process and
related features of its business practices and operations. This is a draft
document, albeit one that we believe reflects significant effort and thought
on the part of both the stakeholders who provided the initial input and the
interdisciplinary design team that drafted this document.
  This CMR recommendation represents an essential milestone in
the broader Congestion Management Reform Project.  The first stage involved
soliciting stakeholder input regarding the problems to be solved,
alternative solutions to address these problems, and criteria for evaluating
reform proposals. The second stage involved the CAISO's crafting an
integrated, internally consistent reform package utilizing the ideas
developed with and/or by Stakeholders in stage one. This document contains
the CAISO's draft recommendation. We emphasize that, although we believe
this recommendation package to be a necessary milestone in the Congestion
Management Reform Project, it is not intended to predispose the final
design. We are actively soliciting Stakeholders' comments and critiques
concerning this recommendation over the coming weeks (stage three of the CMR
project).
  Once the next round of stakeholder input has been assessed,
the CAISO will revise this CMR recommendation. The revised recommendation
will be presented to the CAISO Governing Board for discussion and review
only on August 1 (no Board action requested). The CMR recommendation will
continue to be developed through August and the final recommendation will be
submitted to the CAISO Governing Board for approval at the September 6th and
7th meeting.  The approved CMR recommendation will be prepared (in
conjunction with Stakeholders) for the final Tariff filing to FERC in
November (stage four). A revised, detailed calendar will be presented at the
CMR Stakeholder meetings on July 13 and 14.
  At the July 13 and 14 Stakeholder meetings, the CAISO will
present the entire recommendation, section-by-section and provide the
opportunity for Stakeholders to clarify their understanding of what is being
proposed. Shortly thereafter, we will hold additional Stakeholder meetings
to facilitate detailed discussion of individual elements of the
recommendation. Additional meeting dates will be discussed on July 14 at the
meeting.
  We look forward to reviewing this proposal with you and
receiving your comments. The CAISO welcomes any and all comments and
critiques of this recommendation. We appreciate your attention and efforts
in this endeavor to reform the Congestion Management process.

21:03 GMT  24 August 2000
 DJ US Northwest Pwr Forwards Higher On Water; SW 3Q Up

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Forward prices for electricity in the northwest U.S.
rose
 Thursday on concerns about hydroelectric supplies in the region, traders
said.

 Hydroelectric dam reservoirs are low in the Northwest due to a lack of rain
the past
 several weeks. River flows have been even lower than forecast this week,
and
 hydroelectric generators have been run as much as possible to make up for
reductions
 in supply from the Colstrip generating station in Montana. Transmission
lines from the
 station had to be turned off several times over the past two weeks due to
forest fires in
 the state.

 "All the generators on the Columbia River right now are sucking mud," one
northwest
 utility prescheduler said Thursday.

 Southwest prompt forwards were flat Thursday, but third quarter 2001
contracts started
 racing higher late in the day. Traders said that Enron Corp. is a big
buyer. The market
 rumor is that the California Independent System Operator is in the market
for 3,000
 megawatts of supply for next summer.

 California-Oregon Border contracts for September traded Thursday at
$197-$205 per
 megawatt-hour, compared with Wednesday's range of $181-$190/MWh.

 October COB traded at $139-$145/MWh, compared with $126-$129/MWh Wednesday.


 September Palo Verde contracts traded at $175-$178/MWh, unchanged.
Third-quarter
 2001 Palo Verde traded at $182-$200/MWh Thursday, compared with
$175-$177/MWh
 Wednesday.

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MS").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint "warrants expeditious action."

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO "maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay."  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could "choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets."

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, "To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW."

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace."  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  "Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price."

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, "ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs."  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market ("OOM") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, "such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff."  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, "and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price."

ISO is then "put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets."

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to "straddle the fence" and that, "Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role."  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, "Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move."  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, "thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' "  Hebert states that, "The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter."  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, "including the California markets."

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dan

Subject: ISO To Participate in Super Peak Market



Folks,

Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier
the same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to
place 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO
little choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to
cover their peak hours on hot days.

Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and
California PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am
working with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.
We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or
earlier.

Key people who you may need to contact:
ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are
also in the loop)
PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123
PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124
APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123
APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159

Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have
not had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the
California PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint
WPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this
product/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or
buy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours
of HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can
utilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will
be watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.
The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery
point, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging
transmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its
purchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will
send out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak
market.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be
posted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post
buy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.

You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a
buyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.

I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly
work together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt
the ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going
forward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to
post bids to sell?

gba

  Market Participants:

  On August 1, 2000, the ISO Board of Governors approved a
proposal to conduct a competitive solicitation to procure guaranteed
generation service during natural gas curtailments in the Los Angeles Basin.
Since the service must in place by December 1, 2000, and the ISO expects
this service to be provided by existing generation, the ISO needs to have
responses by October 6, 2000.  ISO staff is preparing the materials for the
solicitation and expects to release those materials in the next few weeks.
We expect final approval of a response by the Board of Governors during the
week of October 23, 2000.

  This note will allow potential respondents to begin
preparing your response in advance of the release of the solicitation.

  The Board memo and presentation regarding this solicitation,
which include the proposed principles of the solicitation, can be found at

Enron Broadband Services is the latest addition to the Enron SAP rollout.  
The Apollo and Beyond project team and Enron's business units are currently 
preparing for the project's final implementation.  Apollo and Beyond is an 
Enron initiative tasked with laying a common financial, human resources, 
project management, and procurement foundation throughout the majority of 
Enron's businesses.

EBS "Go-Live"

On April 1st, Enron Broadband Services supplemented their current SAP 
functionality with HR Online and SAP HR, including payroll and organizational 
structure management.  HR Online enables the EBS population to enter their 
own time, view and update their personal information, and view their vacation 
time and individual payroll information via Enron's intranet.

Additionally, this implementation enhanced the SAP Financial, Project and 
Procurement processes that EBS has had in operation since April 1, 1999.  
These enhancements included an EBS pilot of B2B, a web-based requisitioning 
tool. Among the benefits of these enhancements will be improved information 
flow across business units currently on SAP.

July 1 "Go-Live"

This final Apollo and Beyond implementation will directly impact more than 
15,000 Enron employees and contractors -- odds are that you are one of them!  
People impacted on July 1st include:

all Enron employees paid out of Corporate Payroll in Houston, excluding 
Azurix employees
the financial communities of Enron Energy Services, Enron Investment 
Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation, Gas 
Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and Global Products.
the project management communities of Enron North America, Gas Pipeline 
Group, Global Asset Operations, Global Finance, and Global Products.
the human resources communities of Corporate, Global E&P, Enron Energy 
Services, Enron Engineering and Construction Company, Enron Investment 
Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation (Houston 
only), the international regions, Gas Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and 
Global Products.

General SAP training will be available in late April via the Enron intranet.  
Additional, specific, SAP classes and workshops are scheduled to begin in May 
and continue through August.  Information on the project can be obtained 
through the Enron intranet at http://sap.enron.com and by contacting Business 
Unit representatives currently working with the project.  A list of Business 
Unit representatives is located on the intranet site.

Additional information related to the July 1st implementation will be 
communicated to you over the next few months.

Thank you.

Melissa Becker
Project Leader, Apollo and Beyond

  Market Participants:
  This notice is to inform you that the  ISO is canceling the
CMR stakeholder meetings that were scheduled for August 4 and August 8.  We
are doing so in order to be responsive to Stakeholders' needs for greater
detail as articulated in the two most recent Stakeholder meetings on July 19
and 25.
  As you know, after the July 13-14 introduction to the CME
Recommendation, we scheduled additional meetings (July 19th and 25th, August
4th and 8th) to discuss each element of the Recommendation in greater
detail. We have received many questions and requests for change on all parts
of the Recommendation during the past few weeks.  As a result, we determined
that we needed more time for internal discussion in order to give you the
level of detail that would allow a more meaningful discussion of the
specific recommendations and potential modifications.  This will allow us to
address both your questions and your suggested changes.
  We have rescheduled these detailed discussions for three
consecutive days, August 15-17.  In these meetings, we will address:
* FTRs;
* Day Ahead and Hour Ahead Congestion Management;
* Recallable Transmission;
* Real Time Operations;
* New Generator Interconnection Policy;
* Long Term Grid Planning; and
* Questions and issues on Local Reliability Service that arose from
the July 25 Stakeholder meeting.
  We will also meet on August 25 to discuss the ISO's final
recommendation to the ISO Governing Board.
  We apologize for any inconvenience this change has caused
you, but believe that taking time to develop more details on these topics
will allow more productive discussions.

As you are probably aware, the CPUC voted 5-0 to reject instituting retail 
rate caps in San Diego and instead adopted SDG&E's proposal to refund over 
$100 million.  The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E's motion to enter 
into bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PX 
using the bilateral-option market.  These transactions will be confidential 
and will be disclosed only to the Commission's energy division, for purposes 
of reasonableness.  The Commission did not act upon San Diego's advice letter 
(#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives.  That 
advice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting in 
September.

The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utility 
as a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along its 
costs to the customers.  It will also address whether SDG&E should be 
authorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PX 
purchases.  It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange.  This is 
a fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early next 
week.

Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of the 
key legislative offices.  There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890 
Implementation Group).  From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peace 
is interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp the 
governance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants 
(generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego's 
consumers feel, extend the rate freeze, etc.  Although, most of the other 
legislative offices saw this proposal as a total morass.

The legislative offices that we met with, while interested in providing some 
political cover to DeDe Alpert (Senator from San Diego in a close political 
race), were not interested in pursuing sweeping changes to the current 
structure, although this could change.  However, it should be noted that DeDe 
Alpert said herself that she would introduce rate cap legislation in San 
Diego when the legislature reconvenes on August 7.  Most of the discussion 
with the other offices was on what can be done by next summer and focused on 
bringing on peaking plants and expanding demand responsive programs.

Sandi and Dave Parquet also met with John Stevens, of the Governor's Office.  
He stated that the Governor did not want any major changes to the current 
structure to come across his desk, but that the Governor needed our help in 
preventing such changes from getting there, otherwise he may be politically 
compelled to sign the legislation.  Sandi will send out more information 
later, she's having computer problems.

There will be a hearing next week of the Senate and Assembly Energy 
Committees on San Diego issues on August 10.

We, in GA, will keep you updated on developments.

Subject: DJ Calif Pwr Producers Urge FERC Reject Price Cap Petition 





12:15 GMT 15 August 2000
DJ Calif Pwr Producers Urge FERC Reject Price Cap Petition  (This article
was originally published Monday)  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California power
producers urged federal regulators Monday to reject a petition for price
caps in the state, arguing that intervention in the market would be
counterproductive by discouraging needed investment in new power supplies.
The petition was filed Aug. 2 with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission by San Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE).
It alleges that California's first-in-the-nation competitive power market
suffers from design and structural problems.  Surging power prices plaguing
the state this summer "do not reflect legitimate forces of supply and
demand," SDG&E said, calling on FERC to impose across-the-board electricity
price caps in California of $250 per megawatt-hour indefinitely until the
market flaws are corrected.  But the power producers rejected SDG&E's
analysis of the market problems as "simplistic," and called the imposition
of price caps on all California power sales an unwarranted response to the
power supply shortage.  "SDG&E asks the commission to take unreasonable and
unprecedented action that would effectively rescind every California
supplier's authority to sell energy and ancillary services at market-based
rates," complained Southern Energy California, a subsidiary of Southern Co.
(SO).  "A strict cap will only exacerbate the current supply shortages in
California," Southern Energy and the other power suppliers argued.  "The
imposition of this cap by FERC may discourage power developers from choosing
to serve California markets," said Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. (DYN).  "The
cap may also convince (electricity users they) need not participate in
load-reduction programs, since paying the $250 price cap is cheaper than
shedding load," Dynegy told the commission.  "The imposition of caps on
every California market, and the increased uncertainty as to when - if ever
- they might be removed, sends precisely the wrong message to potential
suppliers of energy in California," Southern Energy said.  The arguments of
the individual power producers in the state were echoed by the Electric
Power Supply Association, the national trade group representing competitive
power producers and marketers.  Imposing price caps in California's volatile
electricity prices would "suffocate markets" and do nothing to address the
chronic power-supply shortages causing prices to spike, EPSA told FERC.
"The relief SDG&E seeks would actually prolong and intensify California's
difficulties," EPSA said.  Price caps would discourage electricity imports
and investment in new power plants to supply the state, while discouraging
price risk management, liquidity and accurate price signals, EPSA said.
FERC has already allowed the California Independent System Operator to cap
the price it is willing to pay for power, which it uses to assure the grid
operates properly and to make up "energy imbalances" on the system.  The ISO
recently lowered its purchase price cap to $250 per megawatt-hour. The SDG&E
petition asks FERC to extend that cap to the state's power exchange, or PX,
which operates as a clearinghouse for wholesale power sales in California.
"A PX bid cap is unnecessary because the ISO purchase price cap has
historically acted as a de facto cap on the PX markets," Dynegy told FERC.

14:05 GMT  24 August 2000
 DJ US Sen. Feinstein Urges Cap For Western US Power Market

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., on Wednesday
urged
 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to place a regionwide cap on
wholesale
 electricity rates for the western United States.

 To date, a price cap of $250 per megawatt-hour has been placed only on
California's
 power market. A regional cap is necessary to avoid "electricity bidding
wars" between
 western states during power shortages that could result in blackouts in
California,
 Feinstein said.

 "As is clearly evident, the energy market in San Diego is not functioning,
at this time,
 as a true market," Feinstein said in a letter to FERC Chairman James J.
Hoecker. "The
 lack of energy generation has produced a dramatic increase in electricity
prices with
 many families and businesses facing energy bills two or three times higher
than normal
 and has led to the possibility of wholesale price gouging."

 Feinstein also supported President Clinton's use Wednesday of $2.6 million
in
 emergency energy assistance funds for low income households, and special
credit
 programs for small businesses.

Subject: ISO Special 8.10.00 Report on Energy Market Issues and Performance: 
May-June, 2000

FYI.  The ISO Dept. of Market Analysis Released a rather hefty "special 
report" yesterday.  The URL is attached.
Among other things, it concludes that, despite the lack of generation 
concentration
in California, market power in times of shortage has been partially 
responsible for the price spikes.

"The observed market power was the combined effect of the bidding activity of 
in-state and out-of-state generation sources....
The high prices bid by out-of-state suppliers as well as the high prices 
quoted to ISO's out-of-market calls are indications of 
the market power of out-of-state suppliers"...[A]t high load conditions, even 
suppliers with less than a 9% market share can 
have significant market power."

Attached is a Draft Decision approving SDG&E's Emergency Motion for authori=
ty=20
to enter into bilateral contracts.

The decision directs to enter into bilateral agreements that will expire by=
=20
12/02.  It provides similar reasonableness guidance as provided to SCE=20
(bilateral contracts must be within 5% of actual annual procurement costs).=
 =20

The draft decision rejects SDG&E's request to allocate those contracts to=
=20
residential and small commercial customers.  It rejects SDG&E's request for=
=20
an exemption from the affiliate rules, which would have allowed SDG&E to=20
enter into bilateral agreements with its trading affiliate without posting=
=20
those transactions or providing an opportunity for a bid process.

Because this decision adopts the same principles in the SCE and PG&E=20
Decisions, I give a low probability to changing the decision language. =20
However, if folks would still like us to weigh in on an issue, please let m=
e=20
know asap.  Thanks.

Subject: Draft Decision Issued in SDG&E Emergency Motion



ALJ Cooke has issued the attached draft decision with regard to the August =
=20
9, 2000, emergency motion filed by SDG&E to enter into bilateral power =20
contracts.? SDG&E sought similar authority to that granted to Edison  and=
=20
PG&E in D.00-08-023.? The draft decision would grant the motion,  but would=
=20
impose certain conditions different from those requested by the  utility.?=
=20
The differences are summarized below:
?
Background
Under the terms of the  Commission=01,s D.00-08-021, SDG&E is currently=20
authorized to participate  in the PX forward markets for energy services,=
=20
subject to seasonal trading  limits, through the end of the last utility ra=
te=20
freeze.? SDG&E is not  proposing an increase to the limits approved in=20
D.00-08-021 and will treat its  capacity purchases under those limits,=20
although it reserves the right to request  expanded authority in the future=
.?=20
The draft decision also notes that  SDG&E proposes that costs associated=20
with, and gains/losses from these  bilateral contracts should be attributed=
=20
only to small commercial and  residential customers.? It also notes that=20
intervenors focused on four  general areas of concern regarding the specifi=
c=20
authority requested by  SDG&E: duration of contracts, reasonableness=20
standards, request for  exemption from affiliate rules, and ratemaking.
?
Duration of  Contracts
SDG&E requested  authority to enter into bilateral contracts that expire on=
=20
or before December  31, 2005.? The ALJ notes that the Commission recently=
=20
instituted an  investigation into the impact of the functioning of the=20
wholesale electric  market on retail rates in SDG&E=01,s service territory =
and=20
that the OII  will consider whether SDG&E should be removed from that defau=
lt=20
provider  role.? The ALJ states that, "the Commission should not compromise=
 =20
future long-term solutions by affording SDG&E greater purchasing authority =
=20
than is needed to address the current emergency situation.? For this  reaso=
n,=20
we limit SDG&E=01,s authority to what we described in D.00-08-023  as near-=
term=20
bilateral contracting authority, that is, contracts with delivery  occurrin=
g=20
on or before December 31, 2002."
?
Reasonableness  Standards
The draft decision  suggests that the OII provides a forum to establish a=
=20
common framework for all  three utilities for determining the reasonablenes=
s=20
of their bilateral  purchases.? However, in the interim, it adopts the same=
=20
reasonableness  standard for near-term contracts as it did for SCE.? "If th=
e=20
average  price of SDG&E=01,s bilateral transactions, delivered or requiring=
 =20
delivery, over the course of an annual period exceeds the average price of =
=20
SDG&E=01,s corresponding portfolio of transactions, delivered or  requiring=
=20
deliver over the same period, by more than 5%, then the Commission  will=20
initiate a reasonableness review.? Reasonableness reviews, to the  extent=
=20
needed, will take place as part of SDG&E=01,s Annual Transition  Cost=20
Proceeding."
?
Affiliate Rules  Exemption
SDG&E's request to be  exempted from the affiliate rules for any purchases=
=20
from affiliates was  denied.
?
Ratemaking
TURN  urged the Commission to reject SDG&E=01,s request to limit the ratema=
king =20
impacts of the bilateral contracts to its residential and small commercial =
=20
customers, saying that, "the potential risks and benefits should be spread =
=20
among all customers."? The draft decision states that, "we do not  believe =
it=20
prudent to limit the cost exposure for these contracts solely to  residenti=
al=20
and small commercial customers.? This aspect of  SDG&E=01,s motion is denie=
d."
?
Transparency  Considerations
The ALJ orders SDG&E  to disclose all bilateral transactions to the Energy=
=20
Division on a confidential  basis in a monthly report.? The draft decision=
=20
notes that, "WPTF and  ARM argue that additional transparency of bilateral=
=20
transactions is required,  compared to that proposed by SDG&E.? We adopt=20
consistent disclosure  standards for SDG&E bilateral contracts as that=20
adopted in D.00-08-023 for  PG&E and SCE.? This issue may be revisited on a=
=20
going forward basis in  I.00-08-002."
?
Response Time
The normal response time  has been shortened.? Parties to the proceeding ma=
y=20
file comments on the  draft decision no later than noon on September 5,=20
2000.? I suggest that  comments be filed agreeing with the thrust of the=20
decision, but strongly  advocating that SDG&E be required to publicly post=
=20
its transactions, as it  agreed to do in Advice Letter 1234-E, with regard =
to=20
SDG&E's participation  in the Block Forward Market.? In addition, we should=
=20
consider whether to  refight the issue of limiting the ratemaking impacts o=
f=20
the bilateral contracts  to SDG&E's residential and small commercial=20
customers.
?
Comments or  suggestions???

  Market Participants:

  The California ISO values Stakeholders' comments on the
Congestion Management Reform (CMR) proposal released on July 11, 2000.  Both
your positive and negative responses are essential to guide us in refining
the CMR recommendation.  We have prepared the attached template for you to
use in submitting your comments.  Receiving your comments in this format
will enable us to understand and respond to your input efficiently.  We will
also post this template at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html>  under the heading
"Congestion Management Reform Recommendation - DRAFT."
  In the first section, we ask that you respond to the
following two questions (summary answers, bulleted lists, etc. are fine):
1. Which fundamental market design features and principles identified
in the proposal should be kept?  Why?
2. Which fundamental market design features and principles identified
in the proposal should be removed?  Why?
  In the second section, please provide detailed comments on
specific sections of the proposal using the template provided.  We have
structured the template to facilitate your detailed comments on Sections 4,
7, 8, 9 and 10 and Appendices A and B, since these are the sections that
contain the main features of the proposal.  The template also includes a
space for general comments on sections 1, 2, 3, 5 and 11.  Since Section 6
is an overview of the proposal, we have not included a comment section in
the template for that section.  We ask that comments include:
* Which main features you think should be retained and why;
* Which main features you think should be removed or modified.  Please
be specific on why, and how you would modify that feature to address the
problem you have identified; and
* Which features and details you think are missing and should be
added, why, and how you suggest adding that feature.
  All three parts-what, why and how you recommend changing the
proposal-are necessary for us to respond to your comments.
  We would like to emphasize our need to receive your comments
on features of the proposal that you like.  Reviews can tend to focus on
features with which reviewers are dissatisfied.  Without hearing support for
features that stakeholders like, it is possible that some broadly supported
features could be changed or eliminated, based on others' stated
disagreement.
  Please submit your initial comments by 5:00 p.m. PDT on
Friday, July 28.  There will be other opportunities for feedback, but we
would like to include a summary of Stakeholders' initial comments in our
discussion with the ISO Governing Board on August 1.  Please send your
comments, using the attached template, via e-mail to bwoertz@caiso.com
<mailto:bwoertz@caiso.com>  and use the phrase "CMR Proposal - Stakeholder
Comments" in the Subject line.  We plan to treat your comments as public and
to include a summary of Stakeholders' comments with the materials that will
go to the ISO Governing Board and/or to FERC.
  The California ISO greatly appreciates the time, effort and
expertise Stakeholders have contributed to the CMR process.  We look forward
to receiving your valuable comments to allow us to further refine and
improve this proposal.

UPDATE ON INTER-SC TRADES ADJUSTMENT BID PROJECT TIMELINE
Market Participants:

Market Participants, through TSWG,  have expressed concern about the
currently scheduled release time between 10 minute settlements and Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid functionality.  As a result of the delay to
implementation of 10 minute settlements, the release time frame has
decreased from the original 1 month to approximately 2 weeks.  Understanding
these timing concerns, the ISO has decided to delay the implementation of
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid.

Therefore, the ISO is revising the implementation target date for Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid until the first week of October 1, 2000.  Following is
an updated project timeline.

Prior to the ISO making this decision, feedback from both business and
technical sides of the Market Participants were taken into consideration.
It was determined that this later date will allow Market Participants
additional testing time to prepare for a successful implementation of the
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid software.

Subject: DJ Power Price Cap In Calif Puts Brinksmanship On Grid 



17:25 GMT 8 August 2000 =DJ Power Price Cap In Calif Puts Brinksmanship On
Grid

   By Mark Golden
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's new, lower cap on the price of wholesale
power is intended to bring relief to consumers burned by this summer's
high-flying electricity rates.
But it has also set the stage for a game of chicken between utilities and
power producers - with the operator of the state's power grid caught in the
middle and a major blackout the consequence if both sides hold their course
on a hot day.
By creating incentives for power producers and power buyers to wait on the
sidelines, the price cap has put the California Independent System Operator
in the position of covering much of the state's power demand at the last
minute - something the grid operator was never intended to do.
"It's not designed to handle a third of the load, and it's not designed to
be the arbitrage tool for either those buying electricity or those supplying
it," Jan Smutny-Jones, chairman of the ISO's board of governors, said of the
ISO's real-time power market. "For the ISO to find 15,000 MW of power on any
given day is a huge undertaking that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on
the real-time operation of the grid. We're going to be in trouble."
Thanks to a break in this summer's high temperatures in California, the ISO
managed to find the power it needed Monday and bought it under the new price
cap of $250 a megawatt-hour. It also looks to be able to make it through
Tuesday.
But the real test could come with higher temperatures forecast for Wednesday
and Thursday - or whenever the next heat wave comes.
The state's power grid is run by the ISO, established by the state's
legislature to ensure that California's utilities were getting enough power
to meet their customer needs.
Utilities typically buy most of the power they need a day in advance based
on weather forecasts and system capacity. A different state-chartered
organization, the California Power Exchange buys most of the power the
utilities need one day ahead of time.
The ISO is supposed plug unexpected gaps by purchasing marginal amounts of
power on a last-minute basis as necessary.
But the price cap is changing the way the game is played.
Prices in the ISO's real-time market are capped at $250 a megawatt-hour. But
prices in the CalPX's day-ahead market are uncapped and free to skyrocket.
As a result, California's main utilities - PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas
& Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and
Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric - will buy only those
supplies available on the day-ahead market that are bid at the ISO cap or
less.
That policy makes sense - electricity is widely regarded as the most
volatile commodity in existence, prices can rise 100-fold in a matter of
days and California's prices are about four times their level last summer.
But it isn't the most sustainable.
Grid Operator Left To Cover Large Shortfall
On Monday, for example, the California PX reported that the utilities bought
all the power suppliers bid in below the price cap, a total of 27,500
megawatts of supply for peak afternoon hours.
But as the sun rose over the California sky and air conditioners ramped up,
the three utilities needed 40,000 megawatts of power to meet demand -
leaving the ISO not just to tweak the system, but to buy almost a third of
what was required.
"It makes it a lot harder for our people to operate the system," ISO
spokesman Patrick Dorinson said.
On Monday, the ISO had to leave its official, computer-based market and
scramble to secure needed power supplies from neighboring utilities by
telephone, as it has done numerous times this summer.
The question for California is whether independent generating companies and
utilities outside the state will sell their power to the state at or below
the $250 price cap, or whether they'll be able to sell their output for a
higher price elsewhere.
Like much of the rest of the country, the western U.S. now needs more
electricity during summer afternoons than it can generate. The booming
electricity-driven new economy has been met with almost no additions to
generating capacity. Companies that have generating capacity are looking for
top dollar.
"Our real-time folks' job is to optimize revenue and get the highest price
for that energy that they can," said Larry Bryant, spokesman for the Public
Service Co. of New Mexico (PNM), which regularly sells power to California.
"There is no preference of customer. There's preference for maximizing the
revenue that hour of that day."
The $250 cap, half what it was until Monday and a third of what it was until
July 1, is well under prices the western wholesale power market has seen
frequently this summer.
The ISO has the authority to break its own cap if necessary to keep the
lights on, but doing so could make a shambles of the state's official power
market.
Traders at utilities with excess power to sell say they will have no
incentive to bid in supply on the ISO's computer system at prices under the
cap if they know the ISO will be picking up the phone later with sweeter
deals.
"At 10 a.m. the ISO operators have to run around and find a sufficient
amount of capacity in the West to serve our needs, and on some days there
really is only a limited amount of capacity to go around," Smutny-Jones
said.
"We're going to have figure out a better way of managing this," he added.

        STAGE 1 EMERGENCY NOTICE [200000208]

Effective 08/26/2000 at 16:00 the California Independent System Operator
has implemented Stage 1 of the Electrical Emergency Plan. The Plan has
been implemented for the following reasons:

Lack of resources

Stage 1 is expected to be in effect from HE 15
through HE 18.

Participating transmission owners are to notify the Utility Distribution
Companies within their operational areas.

Stage 1:    Operating reserves are less than minimum. Advise the Utility
            Distribution Company of potential power shortages and request
            the UDC to advise end-use customers to reduce demand to minimum
            requirements without disruption of employment or curtailment of
            industrial production or commerce. Advise the UDC to prepare for
            imminent implementation of the interruptible load programs and/or
            electrical emergency plan.

This message is from Market Operations  at the California ISO.

Market Participants,

Yesterday at the Market Issues Forum, we presented a discussion on long-term
price cap authority.  This is a matter for discussion now because the
previously granted authority from FERC expires on Nov. 15, 2000.  Attached
is the white paper discussing this topic.  We will seek Board approval on
this matter at the September 6-7 Board meeting.  If you have comments on
this paper, please forward them to Keith Casey at kcasey@caiso.com.

Don Fuller
Director, Client Relations

Netscape 4.74 has been rolled out to the Portland office.  After you've 
completed a fresh login, you will notice Netscape 4.74 on your start menu.  
Just click the Netscape icon and the new version will install automatically.

If you have any problems during this Netscape upgrade, please feel free to 
call any IT person.

Regards,
Paul
