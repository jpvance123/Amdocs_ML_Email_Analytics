SENATE LEADERSHIP
Daschle Pledges Bipartisanship As Dems Take Control
Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Daschle today pledged
to pursue bipartisanship and what he called "united governance"
as Democrats took control of the Senate. Daschle and Minority
Leader Lott pledged to work together to conduct business just as
they worked through issues when Republicans held the majority.
Meanwhile, Republicans scaled back their demands for what must be
included in a new organizing resolution - the first major task
facing Democrats and Republicans in their newly reversed roles.
Daschle told reporters he recognized the unique historic nature
of a mid-session shift in power, and said Democrats would strive
to be fair in their dealings with the GOP, often having
criticized Republican rule in the past. "It would be hypocrisy at
its worst if we were going to take the same tactics. We're not
going to do that," said Daschle. "The tenuous nature of our
majority requires that we act accordingly." Lott took a similar
tone, saying: "The good times, we will remember and try to
repeat. The bad times have already been forgotten."
There were continuing signs of a de-escalation of rhetoric
over the organizational resolution, which must be passed before
new Democratic chairmen can operate their committees effectively.
And Republicans appear to be backing down on their demand that
the resolution establish new procedures to ensure that the Senate
considers presidential nominations. Senate Republican Conference
Chairman Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who last week hinted
Republicans might filibuster the resolution if Democrats did not
meet their concerns, today said, "I've said all along that I
don't want to change the rules of the Senate to disadvantage
members." Democrats - despite their accommodating rhetoric - have
shown no signs of willingness to cede new authority to
Republicans on nominations. Daschle said Democrats would "respect
the process" currently in place.
Minority Whip Nickles said: "I think it's going to work . I
think it's going to be fine." Nickles said he expected a minimum
wage bill, accompanied by some tax relief, to pass this year. But
he said "it remains to be seen" whether a compromise can be
reached on a patients' rights bill, which Daschle has pledged to
bring up after completing work on the education bill. Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a key moderate, said it would be better
if Republicans and Democrats can come to some "mutual
understanding, rather than making some major changes, that may
not stand the test of time." The softening of the GOP stance came
as Republicans could no longer ignore their new minority status.
The Senate today passed a resolution naming Sen. Robert Byrd, D-
W.Va., as the new Senate president pro tempore.
The Senate Republican Conference was scheduled to meet today
to discuss a new organizational resolution, and Daschle was
scheduled to meet with new committee chairmen. Until the Senate
passes a new resolution, freshmen must go without committee
assignments, and panels are composed of members from the 106th
Congress, many with GOP majorities. Daschle said Democrats would
make decisions about new panel assignments after the
organizational resolution is passed. - by Geoff Earle and Charlie

TAXES
House Republicans Stress Impact Of Tax Cut Legislation
Frustrated that the change in Senate leadership has
overshadowed passage of the $1.35 trillion tax cut, House
Republicans today redoubled their efforts to tout tax relief as
President Bush plans to sign the measure into law Thursday.
"Every paycheck, whether it be weekly, biweekly or monthly, will
be bigger in take home pay," House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas
said at a news conference today with GOP leaders. A spokesman for
House Speaker Hastert said the defection of Sen. James Jeffords,
I-Vt., saturated media coverage just as the House and Senate
passed the tax cut bill. "Our view is we have to go out there and
communicate our message," the Hastert spokesman said, adding that
the new Democratic-controlled Senate does not override their
plans.
Thomas sought to correct what he said included "flat out
wrong" media explanations of the tax cut. Thomas said all
taxpayers would get a rebate check beginning this summer. He
emphasized that it was not a "one-time stunt," saying the tax cut
includes a permanent reduction in income tax rates. "It is an
ongoing gift to the American people, who are hard working,"
Thomas said. However, the tax bill, which passed under budget
rules, includes a provision that would "sunset" the tax cuts Dec.
31, 2010, unless they are made permanent. Thomas said the Senate
was responsible for the sunset provision, and sought to put the
onus on the Democrats to make tax relief permanent. House
Majority Leader Armey today said the House would move legislation
to do that, commenting, "Why should we tell families and small
businesses the relief they need will disappear in 10 years?"
In a memo distributed today to House Republicans, Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, who is responsible
for GOP communications, said Jeffords' switch complicated his
party's ability to talk about tax relief. "Sen. Jeffords'
decision to leave the Republican Party was clearly not good news
and had two significant ripple effects - however temporary - for
House Republicans," he wrote. Watts said the Jeffords defection
gave Democrats a forum to blast Republicans and saturated the
media so that insufficient attention was given to the tax cut
bill.
Meanwhile, Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-
Iowa, said it was "possible" to take up a bill extending the
expiring tax breaks this year, while adding, "I think that's
probably wishful thinking, although I would welcome it." He said
he had met with Finance Chairman Baucus, and the two would
continue to work together on prescription drug legislation and
upcoming trade issues. He mentioned small business tax breaks and
energy provisions as other tax legislation that could still move
this year. He also said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., may be the
"leading candidate" to take the new seat on the Finance Committee
created by the party switch of Jeffords. But he noted Sens. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio, and Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., are both more senior,
although they would have to relinquish other prestige assignments
to claim it. - by Mark Wegner

POLITICS
House GOP Moderates Seeking Progress On Key Issues
House Republican moderates said today their leadership has
made no special effort to reach out to them in the wake of the
defection of Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., but complimented House
Speaker Hastert's leadership style and attentiveness to their
priorities. House GOP moderates hope to see movement on such
issues as patients' rights, a prescription drug benefit, campaign
finance reform and the environment. Moderates such as Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., described the Senate as a body of "100
independent operators" and said the Jeffords defection is less
relevant to House moderates, especially given Hastert's openness.
"We have access. He hears us out. We could not ask for a better
leader for the time," Boehlert said. He said the leadership might
not always heed moderates' wishes, but said he has seen progress
this year on some environmental issues, debt reduction and
education. Boehlert said even House Majority Whip DeLay, often a
target of Democrats for his conservative positions, "has reached
out not only post-Jeffords, but pre-Jeffords."
Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., similarly said she has seen no
additional outreach from leadership, but called Jeffords'
decision a "red flag" for national party leaders. "In a two-party
system, you need to bring people together if we are to be in the
majority," she said. Roukema cited education reform as "good
evidence of excellent progress," but said she also would like to
see action on prescription drugs and campaign finance reform.
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who urged Jeffords not to defect
and has been largely content with Hastert's treatment of campaign
finance reform, said moderate issues have found their way onto
the table this year. "That's why we don't have the problem in the
House," Shays said.
Speaking with reporters Tuesday, National Republican
Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia used a
sports metaphor to describe Hastert's management of the GOP
Conference. Davis said that, unlike the Senate, House Republicans
may disagree in private but play "team ball" in public. "The key
to our success is we all play together," Davis said. Hardline
conservative positions do sometimes make floor votes difficult
for members representing marginal districts. Rep. Michael Castle,
R-Del., said he hopes the new Democratic-controlled Senate might
provide an opening for President Bush to be more collaborative in
his approach. "I'd assume our leaders think 'pure Republican'
positions need to be established in the House, but some of us in
the House would prefer that we pre-negotiate some things like
we've done on education," Castle said. "There will be some
pulling and tugging as we go along." - by Mark Wegner

ENERGY
House Drops Calif. Energy Bill, Daschle Wants Action
House Republicans pulled the plug on a short-term California
electricity relief bill today after failing to strike a deal with
Democrats on a controversial price cap provision. The development
comes as two leading Senate Democrats plan to make California
energy legislation a top priority of the Democrats' first month
in power. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Bingaman
will focus on producing a short-term bill in the next few weeks
before shifting to a more comprehensive energy bill after the
July Fourth recess, he said today. "We'll see what we can agree
on in a short-term bill" by July 4, Bingaman said at a session
with reporters. Meanwhile, Majority Leader Daschle, clarifying
earlier remarks, said Congress should order the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to limit prices in California's wholesale
electricity market if FERC refuses to act.
In a letter to California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, Daschle
said that unless FERC curbs wholesale prices, "Congress will have
to consider legislation to address this issue." Although Daschle
said he does not believe Congress "can or should establish a
dollar amount for the price of electricity," he endorsed
legislation offered by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and
Gordon Smith, R-Ore., that orders FERC to limit prices. "Unless
FERC acts soon," Daschle said, the "legislation should be taken
up and passed . I will support all necessary efforts to meet that
goal." Daschle's comments come after Daschle appeared to soften
his support for price caps in a Los Angeles Times interview late
last week.
On the other side of the Capitol, House Democrats blasted
Republicans for calling off an Energy and Commerce Committee
markup of the California bill. "I think that the canceling of the
markup was a mistake," Energy and Commerce ranking member John
Dingell, D-Mich., said at a news conference. Earlier, Energy and
Commerce Chairman Tauzin and Energy and Commerce Energy and Air
Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, told reporters
they pulled the bill to protect good relations on the panel. The
Republican leaders said they had the votes to pass the bill and
reject a Democratic amendment to limit wholesale prices. But the
contentious votes would have made it more difficult to gather
Democratic support for the more comprehensive energy plan this
summer. Still, Tauzin said the planned committee action had
spurred the Bush administration and California lawmakers to
implement many of its provisions. Barton, the author of the bill,
said the victory was bittersweet. "I hope I don't have many more
victories like this," he grumbled. - by Brody Mullins

ENERGY
GOP Defends Bush Energy Policy Against Attacks
Republican legislators on the House Resources Committee and
Interior Secretary Norton today made a pre-emptive strike against
critics of President Bush's national energy policy at a news
conference before Norton's testimony before the committee.
Resources Chairman Hansen, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin
and Norton defended the administration's energy policy, repeating
the mantra that the proposal includes environmental protections,
conservation initiatives and renewable and alternative energy
measures as well as provisions to increase domestic oil
production. Tauzin adamantly took issue with criticism against
increasing domestic oil production, arguing that the United
States must increase domestic oil supplies to prevent future
energy crises and reduce its dependence upon other countries. But
Tauzin was also quick to add that Congress and the administration
will concentrate their efforts "big time" on conservation, demand
reduction, environmental protections and alternative energy
sources.
Fielding questions on the issue of opening up newly designated
national monuments for drilling, Norton said the Interior
Department is studying the designated lands on a "case-by-case"
basis - receiving comments from state and local officials on
support for the national monuments, which were designated by the
Clinton administration during its final days. Norton noted that
some states steadfastly support their national monuments, while
others vehemently oppose the land restrictions, adding that the
department will take this into consideration before opening these
lands up for domestic oil production. Added Hansen, "What can be
opened up, should be."
At the other end of the hall, two Democratic panel members
held their own news conference to call attention to a designated
area in Montana that will be opened for drilling in July. A
coalition of American Indian tribes and environmental groups
joined Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Resources ranking member
Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., to introduce legislation to overturn a
federal permit allowing oil drilling in Weatherman Draw, a
pristine Montana valley. The coalition argued the site contains
one of the most significant collections of Indian art on the
Northern Plans, including prehistoric, multicolored drawings of
shields, animals and human figures. Last month, a state agency
gave Denver-based Anschutz Exploration Corp. permission for
exploratory drilling in the valley. Anschutz holds leases to oil
rights on two parcels of land in Weatherman Draw and has
permission to start drilling as early as July 21. During Norton's
testimony, Rahall asked Norton to use her authority to stop the
drilling but Norton declined to say whether she would prohibit
the drilling, but promised to continue to monitor the area and
work with local officials and tribal groups. - by Greta Wodele

FINANCE
LaFalce Promises Review Of SEC Protection Of Investors
House Financial Services ranking member John LaFalce, D-N.Y.,
said today he intends to "aggressively" pursue an investigation
into the SEC's capacity to protect investors, saying that too
much of Congress' financial agenda traditionally has been
"industry driven." A case in point, LaFalce told a group of
reporters, is pending SEC fee reduction legislation, which he
said ought to have been considered in the context of "an
examination of what the needs and role of the SEC should be."
While saying he is not opposed to a fee reduction for investors,
LaFalce said he felt a "much larger look at issues and questions"
was warranted. While acknowledging the committee's work in the
area of financial modernization, he said, "This has been the
agenda of industry." Asserting that investor protections have
been ignored for the last 25 years, LaFalce said one issue where
there is "a crying need for a thorough, exhaustive investigation
[is] the capacity of the SEC to protect investors given [the
agency's] limited resources and reach of the law. I intend to
pursue this aggressively." In that vein, LaFalce expressed a
desire to see the SEC's enforcement capabilities beefed up by
increasing the agency's enforcement staff "not by 2 or 3 percent,
but by 200 to 300 percent."
With the Senate's shift from Republican to Democratic control,
LaFalce contended that the "stumbling block" to consumer advocacy
in that chamber "has been eradicated. Proponents of consumer
advocacy have been emboldened." Noting that newly installed
Senate Banking Chairman Sarbanes shares his consumer protection
concerns, LaFalce said he expected he would be helped both
offensively and defensively in the House. "It will help me both
advance my agenda and stop agendas I oppose," LaFalce said.
Overall, LaFalce surmised he would be afforded greater leverage
in the legislative negotiations and in setting the agenda. "If
you know an issue is going to be taken up in conference, you
might as well take it up now," LaFalce said.
As for House Financial Services Chairman Oxley, who has been
criticized in some circles as relying too heavily on the
financial industry in setting his agenda and priorities, LaFalce
described their working relationship as still evolving. While
expressing great affection for Oxley personally, as a friend of
20 years, LaFalce said he had yet to glean Oxley's "substantive
disposition" on a number of fronts - consumer protection
included. He intimated there might be too much top down control,
with the full committee dictating to subcommittee chairmen on
what and when to hold hearings and markups. "I don't think that's
the way to legislate, LaFalce said. "That is not my idea of
thoughtful legislating." - by Pamela Barnett

HEALTH
Managed Care Industry Faults Bill Over Litigation Factor
Leaders of the managed care industry today sketched out for
reporters what will likely become a familiar theme over the next
several weeks as the Senate prepares to debate a patients' rights
bill - that the leading bipartisan measure would hurt patients
more than it would help them. "It would be impossible not to
conclude . that this is a trial lawyer takeover of the healthcare
system," Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of the American
Association of Health Plans, said at a briefing. Ignagni said
that by dramatically expanding the right to sue health plans in
both state and federal courts, the bill sponsored by Senate
Commerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. John Edwards,
D-N.C., and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman
Kennedy would equally dramatically increase the cost of health
insurance. "And the only way for [employers] to recoup is for
workers to trade additional wages, or workers will have to pay
more directly for health care," Ignagni said.
While the AAHP has expressed "concerns" with the leading
alternative measure - sponsored by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,
John Breaux, D-La., and James Jeffords, I-Vt., and backed by
President Bush - Ignagni was careful not to rule out the
possibility that the organization could ultimately back some
expansion of liability in federal court only. While the
organization has been steadfast over the past five years in its
opposition to any expansion of liability while supporting a
requirement for independent outside review of health plan
denials, Ignagni said a decision to support the Frist-Breaux-
Jeffords bill or any other substitute "will be made by our
members," who "will be instructing us every step of the way."
Ignagni said she also expects that insurance and business
opponents could soon be joined by the hospital industry, which
has been largely supportive of patients' rights legislation,
particularly provisions that would require insurers to pay for
emergency room care. Further study of liability language has
shown that it could not only expose physicians to new lawsuits,
Ignagni said, but also hospitals. "Every hospital in this country
is as vulnerable as every physician," she said. - by Julie Rovner

TRADE
Legislators Urge ITC Review Of Canadian Wheat Board
Senate Finance Chairman Baucus, Budget Chairman Conrad, Sens.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, and Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., today urged the
International Trade Commission at a hearing to pursue an
aggressive investigation of the Canadian Wheat Board, a state
trading enterprise that exports all western Canadian wheat.
Former Trade Representative Barshefsky requested the
investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act last
October, and the ITC has said it will submit a confidential
report to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative by Sept.
24. Wheat farmers in the Northern Plains have complained that
since the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect in
1989 the Canadian Wheat Board has been using unfair and secretive
trading practices to sell wheat in the United States and in
markets where U.S. and Canadian producers compete.
"What we need from the commission in this investigation is an
exhaustive catalog and description of the discriminatory pricing
policies of the wheat board and the most precise possible
quantification of the effects on U.S. producers of these unfair
practices," Baucus said. "And we need that information to be made
available to interested parties and the public to the maximum
extent possible." Charging that the Canadian government and the
wheat board have "stonewalled" previous U.S. efforts to get
information on the wheat board's operations, Baucus urged the ITC
to "use all secondary sources in the U.S. government and the U.S.
and Canadian private sectors" to collect information and draw
"meaningful conclusions."
Craig noted that while the USTR request was in response to a
petition from the North Dakota Wheat Commission, the
investigation has the support of national and other state wheat
groups as well. Both Craig and Pomeroy pointed out support for
future trade agreements has eroded in the northern border states
because residents there believe the agreement with Canada has
worked to their disadvantage. Pomeroy also said that, if the
Canadians refuse to provide information, "silence can and must be
used against them." Dorgan said U.S. farmers had been "patient"
with the government for 10 years and that the U.S. response to
the Canadian situation to date has been "pathetic." An ITC
official noted during the hearing that the Canadian Wheat Board
was invited to testify, but chose not to. - by Jerry Hagstrom

FINANCE
Grassley To Form Strategy With House Republicans On Bankruptcy
Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, today
said he intends to meet as early as this week with House
Republican leadership and committee chairmen to try and forge a
consensus strategy on "the difficult parliamentary situation"
brewing on bankruptcy reform legislation. The House and Senate
each have passed individual bills but Republicans want to avoid
reopening the measure in conference. The House has the option of
taking up the Senate-passed bill, but Grassley indicated that is
unlikely, noting the Senate bill's inclusion of language
pertaining to homestead exemptions and clinic violence.

ENERGY
Dems Ask Burton To Investigate Cheney's Energy Task Force
House Government Reform Committee Democrats Tuesday wrote
Government Reform Chairman Burton to urge him to look into Vice
President Cheney's energy task force, which met privately with
major Republican donors in formulating the Bush administration's
energy policy, the Associated Press reported. Government Reform
ranking member Henry Waxman, D-Calif., asked Burton to conduct a
hearing on what took place at the Cheney group's secret meetings
and the identities of all participants. "The Cheney task force
has conducted its meetings in private, and reportedly has
obtained input from private citizens and groups, including
political contributors," Waxman wrote in the letter. The AP
reported last month that GOP contributors - including executives
from power wholesaler Enron and the Edison Electric Institute,
the utility industry lobbying group - had met with Cheney to
discuss energy policy. A committee spokesman said the Republican
staff has not had a chance to discuss the letter with Burton.

POLITICS
Evans Participates In Steel Industry Rally
Commerce Secretary Evans joined members of Congress from both
parties today in pledging to stand with the United Steelworkers
of America in their effort to help the ailing domestic steel
industry. Evans' presence at rally at the Capitol came one day
after the administration announced it was starting a Section 201
action in response to evidence of serious injury the industry has
suffered as a result of allegedly illegal dumping by foreign
producers. Evans said the move was just a first step in
addressing what has become an uneven playing field. Just how far
the administration would go beyond taking action under existing
trade laws is not clear. While the workers and their allies in
Congress greeted the news of the Section 201 action positively,
they pressed today for passage of a bill that would also provide
government subsidies to help ailing steel manufacturers rebuild
and recover and shore up health and retirement funds hit hard by
the crisis in the last few years.

POLITICS
Watson Wins Special Election
Democratic state Sen. Diane Watson coasted to an easy victory
Tuesday in the special election to pick a successor to the late
Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif. With all precincts reporting, Watson
- a former ambassador and the first black woman elected to the
California state Senate - had 75 percent of the vote, while
Republican nominee Noel Irwin Hentschel had 20 percent. Watson's
victory means the House Republicans now hold a 221-210 majority,
with two independents and two vacancies. The next special
election will be held June 19 to fill the vacancy created by the
death of Rep. Norman Sisisky, D-Va., while a special election has
yet to be set to choose a successor to the late Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., who died on Memorial Day. Watson will be sworn into her
new office Thursday. Watson's election was virtually assured once
she won the Democratic nomination, since the 32nd District is 73
percent Democratic. Its population is 40 percent black, with a
growing number of Hispanics.

THE FINAL WORD
"I'm hoping someday the weight comes back, as it was fated to

- Senate Minority Leader Lott, today comparing the job of
majority leader to that of Atlas carrying the weight of the world

Lott lost the majority leader's post he held for the past five
years.

Gents:

You have asked Doug Wood and myself to make some specific recommendations  
for a possible German/European gas case the successful prosecution of which 
could produce significant improvements in our continental gas business. 

Doug and I are actively working on this and garnering views and input from 
our commercial and legal colleagues as well as from external counsel and 
consultants. Unfortunately, this is taking a little longer than expected. 
John, I know you are keen to get something by this Friday.  We would like a 
few more days grace from you (say Wedensday of next week) to ensure that we 
provide all of you with something meaty to go on.  I trust this meets with 
your understanding. Thanks

Energy Crisis in Brazil Brings   Dimmer Lights and Altered Lives


By LARRY ROHTER

Faced with a rapidly worsening energy crisis that threatens to

Dominik,

It was good to speak with you at the EEMF Forum; we all found your 
presentation impressive and the responses to the questions finely tuned to 
leave us thinking that we had been given priviledged access to information 
when in fact we hadn't; what a pro!

As I said, my colleague Rick Shapiro (head of our global public affairs)  was 
impressed and he was serious when he thought of you for our Frankfurt 
office.  I am sure that if you showed interest, things could move quickly (or 
even slowly, if that's what you wanted) and any particular circumstances that 
you had would be taken into account.  I can certainly attest to the welcoming 
nature of Enron.  have a think about it, and if you want to folow up, on a 
completely informal and no commitment basis, let me know.  Even if you do not 
want to leave, it's good to know what your market worth is!!

Lunch some time? 

Brendam

SBC WITHDRAWS BID TO OFFER InterLATA SERVICES IN MISSOURI

SBC Communications, Inc., today withdrew its petition to offer
in-region interLATA (local access and transport area) services in
Missouri in the face of FCC concerns about rates for unbundled
network elements and the adequacy of its operation support
systems (OSSs).

SBC said it would provide "additional evidence" supporting its
Missouri application and refile a petition with the FCC "as soon
as possible."  The FCC would have 90 days after the filing of the
new petition to decide whether SBC had complied with section 271
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which mandates that Bell
operating companies meet a 14-point "competitive checklist" of
market-opening requirements before they can offer in-region
interLATA services.

Refiling the application would enable SBC to "further address
questions raised by the Department of Justice and others over
SBC's original application, as well as provide updated evidence
of continued compliance with section 271," SBC said.  Justice
didn't recommend that the FCC reject the application, but it did
raise several questions, including whether SBC's unbundled
network element rates in Missouri complied with the FCC's TELRIC
(total-element long-run incremental cost) standard (TR, May 14).

"We believe our application for Missouri passes all the tests,
and Missouri regulators agreed by unanimously endorsing our
application," said Priscilla Hill-Ardoin, SBC senior vice
president.  "Our markets are open, as the rapid growth of
competition in the state demonstrates.  But it is important that
our application record include a comprehensive response to
several new issues raised since our Missouri application was
filed.  We would rather the FCC vote on the most current
information available."

In a statement issued late this afternoon, FCC Chairman Michael
K. Powell said, "During the FCC Common Carrier Bureau's review of
SBC's section 271 application for authority to offer long
distance service in Missouri, concerns surfaced related to cost-
based pricing in its region and operation support systems (OSS).
Given these concerns SBC has chosen to withdraw the application."
Mr. Powell said the proceeding was "terminated until such time as
SBC has addressed these issues and is prepared to resubmit its
application."


***************************************************************
LAWMAKERS, POLICY ADVOCATES PITCH BROADBAND SERVICE BILLS

With key votes on broadband services legislation approaching in
the House -- including a possible floor vote on HR 1542 later
this month -- telecom lawmakers and industry officials today made
a new round of policy pitches on the subject.  Their audience was
the more than 100 congressional staffers at today's Internet
Caucus luncheon in the U.S. Capitol.

The luncheon at times seemed like a mini-hearing:  Lawmakers
offered their usual arguments, challenged each other's claims,
and asked those in attendance for support.  In a separate panel
held later, industry representatives drew swords over broadband
services legislation.

Carrying the flag for the Bell companies' bill of choice, the
Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act, HR 1542, were Rep.
W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.), its author, and Reps. Rick Boucher
(D., Va.), and Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.).  Filling out the
congressional panel were two of the more outspoken skeptics of
the data-relief legislation -- Reps. Steve Largent (R., Okla.)
and Christopher Cannon (R., Utah).

Rep. Largent argued that HR 1542's provision to eliminate the in-
region interLATA (local access and transport area) restrictions
on the Bell companies' provision of data services would remove
the Bells' incentive to open their local markets.  "It's like
changing the rules of the game in the middle of the game," he
said.  "No other industry has that kind of domination by one
entity. . .like the Bells do in the local loop."

Rep. Tauzin fired back, saying the Bell companies were "always in
the middle of a game."  The 14-point market-opening check-list
found in section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 "has
become 1,100 points," he said.  "And the FCC has gummed things up
so badly, that AT&T [Corp.] can sit there beautifully and stymie
entry" into the cable modem market, he said.

HR 1542 would correct that discrepancy and spur competition by
putting the Bells' provision of advanced services on equal
regulatory footing with the broadband offerings of cable TV
providers, said Reps. Boucher and Tauzin.  "But AT&T loves the
status quo so much. . .that's why they've spent all this money on
TV ads opposing" HR 1542, Rep. Tauzin said.  There is a "good
chance" that HR 1542 will be taken up on the House floor before
the July 4 break, he said.

Rep. Cannon, who advocates a different approach to spurring
advanced service deployment, said AT&T Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer C. Michael Armstrong told him yesterday that
Congress's consideration of HR 1542 has contributed to Wall
Street's sour outlook on the competitive local exchange carrier
(CLEC) industry.

"Mr. Armstrong said he had no interest in buying a [CLEC] as long
as HR 1542 is out there," Rep. Cannon said.  "I don't agree that
those companies are failing because of bad business plans," he
added.  "The Bells have blocked their access" to local markets.

During the industry panel, HR 1542's provision to scale back the
FCC's rules on "line sharing" sparked debate between Larry
Clinton, vice president-large company affairs for the U.S.
Telecom Association, and Thomas Koutsky, VP-law and public policy
for Z-Tel Technologies, Inc.

"If you want competition for local phone service, you don't want
line sharing," Mr. Clinton told attendees.  But Mr. Koutsky said
"the point of line sharing and unbundling was to provide rings
for CLECs to climb into the market."  Passage of HR 1542 would
remove those market-access elements, he said.


***************************************************************
CARRIERS ASK WIRELESS BUREAU TO RETHINK `E911' DECISION

Four carriers have asked the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications
Bureau to reconsider its decision regarding who should pay for
Phase I enhanced "911" (E911) systems.  In a May 7 letter, bureau
Chief Thomas J. Sugrue said the 911 selective router maintained
by incumbent local exchange carriers was the proper demarcation
point for allocating E911 implementation costs between wireless
carriers and public safety answering points (PSAPs) (TR, May 14).
Mr. Sugrue was responding to a request for clarification from the
King County, Wash., E911 program (TR, Aug. 21, 2000).

The bureau's decision supported the PSAPs' argument regarding the
demarcation point.  Carriers, on the other hand, had maintained
that PSAPs should be responsible for E911 network components or
upgrades beginning at the wireless carrier's mobile switching
center, not the 911 selective router.

In a petition filed yesterday in Common Carrier docket 94-102,
Qwest Wireless LLC, Verizon Wireless, VoiceStream Wireless Corp.,
and Nextel Communications, Inc., said the bureau's decision "is
inconsistent with the Commission's rules and underlying orders
and is beyond the bureau's delegated authority."  They asked the
bureau to designate the mobile switching center as the
demarcation point.

The carriers charged that the bureau failed to follow the Ad-
ministrative Procedure Act's mandate that it consider and respond
to "significant" comments filed in the record of the proceeding.
The companies also said the bureau's decision required a formal
rulemaking by the full Commission.


***************************************************************
MCI SHARES BEGIN TRADING AGAIN, AS WorldCom ISSUES TRACKING STOCK

WorldCom, Inc., has split each share of its common stock into two
tracking stocks, one of which will reflect the performance of the
unit that provides long distance service to consumers and small
businesses.  WorldCom is calling that unit the MCI Group because
WorldCom acquired most of that business when it bought MCI
Communications Corp.  The MCI Group also includes WorldCom's
wireless messaging and dial-up Internet access operations.

The other tracking stock will reflect the performance of the
WorldCom Group, which includes the company's high-growth data,
Internet, international, and commercial voice businesses.  Each
existing WorldCom share has been converted into one WorldCom
Group tracking share and 1/25 of an MCI Group tracking share.

Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's president and chief executive
officer, has been talking for nearly a year about separating the
slow-growing consumer long distance business from the faster-
growing WorldCom operations (TR, July 31, 2000).  The split was
approved today at a shareholders meeting in Clinton, Miss.

The two tracking stocks will provide "two distinct, clear, and
compelling investment opportunities," Mr. Ebbers said.  The MCI
Group stock will pay a quarterly dividend of 60 cents per share;
WorldCom shares won't pay a dividend.  The new shares will begin
trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq stock market.


***************************************************************
AT&T COMPLETES CABLE MODEM `OPEN-ACCESS' TRIAL

AT&T Broadband today said it had completed a six-month trial in
Boulder, Colo., that allowed multiple Internet service providers
(ISPs) to offer high-speed access over AT&T's cable modem
platform.  The company said it was "on schedule" to offer
consumers their choice of cable modem ISPs by mid-2002.

AT&T Broadband said more than 300 end-users and four ISPs
participated in the trial, which cost about $20 million.  The
Boulder trial will be extended for two months in a limited area
to continue evaluating the "service agent" software.  Customers
use that software to register for and connect to an ISP.

AT&T also plans to continue testing billing and customer-care
features before launching a limited commercial program in
Massachusetts that will let customers choose their cable modem
ISP.  That launch is slated for later this year.

SJM to mobilise retired army officers

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) would marshal a battery of retired army 
officials to raise the banner of revolt against the government's decision for 
privatisation of the defence sector. 
The SJM is expecting to mobilise support of retired senior army officials in 
order to drive home the point that the decision to privatise and allow FDI in 
defence production was "anti-national". These officials would lead the dharna 
from July 25 outside Parliament, sources in the SJM say.
After its council meeting at Shimla, the SJM is preparing to launch a 
full-blown attack against the government for pursuing its policies of 
economic liberalisation and globalisation. "The decision to hold a three-day 
agitation during the monsoon session of Parliament is intended to convey the 
message that the SJM would continue its struggle," said a senior 
office-bearer. The Swadeshi faction within the Sangh Parivar appears buoyed 
by the fact that the council had adopted four resolutions which approved the 
SJM's struggle against the Enron project, WTO and the government's decision 
to privatise the defence productions. 
Sources in the SJM maintain that given the resolutions passed by the council, 
it was unlikely that the RSS leadership would intervene and ask the SJM to 
mend its ways. "In the Bangalore meeting with the RSS leadership, a broad 
consensus was evolved that all RSS-affiliated organisations were free to 
chalk out their own course of actions and the RSS would not intervene," they 
said. 
Obviously, the SJM has been bracing up for a confrontation with the 
government in major economic issues by putting up BMS founder and senior RSS 
leader Dattopant Thengadi in front to criticise the government.

States cannot afford DPC power

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The Centre's initiative towards facilitating sale of power from the Enron
-promoted Dabhol project in Maharashtra to other states is likely to come a 
cropper. 
Sources told Business Standard that the states would in no way be able to 
purchase power from Dabhol Power Company (DPC) as it would be difficult to 
lower the tariff to Rs 3 per unit. "No state will be able to buy power from 
DPC at a rate above Rs 3 per unit considering the rate at which they are 
supplying power to the consumers at present," said a source in the Central 
Electricity Authority (CEA).
Power minister Suresh Prabhu had only last week asked CEA to consult the 
power-deficient neighbouring states of Maharashtra seeking their views on the 
requirement and tariff at which they would be able to buy electricity from 
DPC. 
Sources said that states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Goa, to which 
DPC could supply power, were not in a position to buy it at a cost which was 
more than what they spend at present. 
They pointed out that even after a considerable reduction in tariff, it was 
highly unlikely that DPC would sell power to these states at the rates 
affordable by them. 
As for the other states, transmission cost would only add up to the already 
high cost of Dabhol power. Hence, the proposition is almost ruled out, said 
sources. 
They said that the unit cost of power for all SEBs was around Rs 3 at 
present. Interestingly, the average tariff of all the SEBs was estimated to 
be 208 paise per unit in 1999-2000, at a 74 per cent tariff to cost ratio. 
In 1999-2000, the unit cost of power supply in Gujarat was 287.30 paise, and 
in Madhya Pradesh, it was 252.72 paise. Maharashtra had 254.36 paise per unit 
cost of power supply in 1999-2000. 
Sources said that the the existing tariff structure and supply cost was a 
clear indication why third party sale had not been allowed by the states even 
though Section 43 of the Indian Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 allowed such 
sale. 
They added that the chances of states allowing third-party sale by the 
independent power producers in the light of the DPC-MSEB controversy was 
remote. The Centre has asked the states to allow third-party sale from the 
IPPs.

Dabhol lenders to study pullout cost

Lenders to the Dabhol Power project have mandated their engineer, Stone and 
Webster, to do a costing study on the implications of mothballing the second 
phase of the project. The issue is whether to close it now or wait till the 
civil work on the project is over. 
Enron has made it clear that it wants to pull out of the second phase unless 
issues relating to the power purchase agreement are resolved and the 
government of India makes a firm commitment on the offtake of power.
IDBI executive director RS Agarwal, who was present at the two-day lenders' 
meeting in Singapore, told Business Standard that the institutional lenders 
will discuss the report of the engineers before deciding on a further course 
of action. 
The second phase is 92 per cent complete. Total completion would entail the 
finalisation of the power blocks and the LNG facility. Incidentally, the 
trial run of the first block of the second phase_740 mw was to have taken 
place today, but failed to happen on account of the legal battle between DPC 
and MSEB. 
To date, more than $1,570 million has been invested in the second phase. 
Stone & Webster's report will identify how much additional funds the lenders 
would have to plough in depending upon whether the project is shelved 
immediately or after completion of construction activity. It will also figure 
out the funds required to restart the project. 
"The legal position of the two parties - DPC and MSEB - has complicated the 
issue," said Agarwal. Foreign lenders are reportedly unconvinced about the 
Indian government's seriousness in resolving the issue. 
Lenders have expressed anxiety over the suspension of power offtake by the 
MSEB, as this has affected the $50 million cash flow. The priority is for the 
two sides to resolve the issue through negotiations at the earliest. DPC 
ought to take the initiative as it is at the receiving end, said industry 
sources.

Enron Introduces Price Hedging for Memory Chips
By Bob Sechler

06/07/2001
Dow Jones Business News

Dow Jones Newswires 
HOUSTON, Texas -- Dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAM, have 
long been viewed as the pork bellies of the computer industry, commodities 
whose prices swing widely based on supply and demand.
Enron Corp. (ENE) is taking the analogy a step further by enabling DRAM 
manufacturers and consumers, such as computer companies, to engage in the 
same price hedging strategies deployed in industries that depend on 
traditional commodities. 
The company has launched a lot program to buy and sell DRAM chips based on 
forward contracts, and it says an average of 25,000 standard 128-megabit DRAM 
chips a week were traded through its system during the first quarter, the 
initial quarter for active trading. That is a small amount relative to the 
overall world-wide DRAM market, estimated at $32 billion last year, but it's 
a start. 
"The [DRAM] chip market is a boom-or-bust cycle, with prices very high or 
very low," said Kenneth Wang, director of Enron's global semiconductor group. 
"It's the perfect market. And Enron has the credibility." 
Enron is no stranger to making markets. The company, once a stodgy natural 
gas pipeline operator, has evolved into a major commodity marketer and 
trader, dealing in everything from energy products to chemicals and Internet 
bandwidth capacity. 
Chip industry players and observers are intrigued by the DRAM effort, 
although many remain skeptical. Most point out that the potential for a DRAM 
futures market has been discussed for years with little to show for it. 
"All of the PC companies I know of would love to have an effective hedge" 
against DRAM price swings, Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Dan Niles said. 
Every computer contains at least one of the chips, and many contain multiple 
chips, making DRAM chips among the top component expenses for computer 
makers. Other products, such as automobiles and digital cameras, use the 
memory chips as well. 
At present, DRAM chips are sold through direct contracts with manufacturers, 
such as Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Samsung Electronics Co., and through 
a spot market, where the price fluctuates daily. There is no independent 
exchange for DRAM futures that would allow manufacturers of the chips or 
their consumers to hedge against unexpected price swings. 
Challenges to forward trading in DRAM have proved daunting. DRAM isn't quite 
uniform, although it's considered the closest thing to a commodity in the 
computer industry. Many different configurations of the same basic chip 
exist, depending on the needs of the customer. 
DRAM prices have fallen over time -- about 30% a year over the past 25 years 
as manufacturing costs have declined -- despite short-term fluctuations. 
Memory-chip prices have fallen steeply this year because of weak computer 
demand. Standard 128-megabit chips have been selling recently for about $2.40 
on the spot market, off almost 50% since February. 
Technical innovation always has the potential to render existing DRAM 
varieties obsolete, which would open the door to additional risk for the 
holder of a forward buy contract. 
Nonetheless, some major industry players are watching Enron's effort closely. 
Officials at Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ), a leading consumer of DRAM chips, 
think the effort has merit and could work. Compaq hasn't made any DRAM 
purchases through Enron yet but remains receptive to the idea. 
The trend of falling DRAM prices "happens on a macro level, but there have 
been years when the price has increased 50% or 100%, and it happens in a very 
quick period of time," said Jack Baikie, Compaq's vice president of corporate 
procurement. "It's not a predictable cost curve" in the short-term. 
This year's declining prices likely would reverse quickly upon some signal 
that PC demand was rebounding, he said. A forward trading market "could 
provide us the ability to anticipate market trends and do some no-risk, or 
minimal-risk, hedging," Mr. Baikie said. 
Mr. Baikie dismisses the notion that DRAM isn't a commodity. "A memory chip 
is a memory chip," he said, with the only difference being how an individual 
consumer elects to configure and use it. 
Micron, one of the top DRAM manufacturers, also is receptive to the idea of a 
forward trading market. But Micron spokesman Kipp Bedard cautioned that the 
technical variations of DRAM, combined with continuing innovation, aren't 
insignificant issues and have proved to be a problem in past efforts. 
Enron is confident it has the expertise to package and make standard its 
forward contracts for DRAM in a way that renders the technical differences 
surmountable. Company officials point to Enron's pioneering effort in 
Internet bandwidth trading as an example of a market that also faced 
technical hurdles. 
But Enron officials acknowledge they are still demonstrating that their 
effort is viable and valuable. 
"We want people to first get used to it," Enron's Mr. Wang said. "It's a 
process of education." He expects trading volume to increase when big 
companies use the market. 
Enron executives said that DRAM is the first of their efforts to establish 
forward markets for all types of computer components. Eventually, Enron plans 
to trade forward contracts for components such as liquid-crystal displays. 
"We'd like to hedge maybe 60% of a computer, if possible, in the long-term," 
Mr. Wang said. "That's our plan."

Calif Eyes Ending Access To Alternative Power Suppliers
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators appear ready to vote 
next week on a proposal to suspend the ability of large electricity users to 
sign contracts directly with energy suppliers. 
The move is called for in the February bill that put the state in the power 
business, but its approval by the California Public Utilities Commission 
would damp plans in the Legislature to reduce the burden on Edison 
International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison by making large 
industrial customers responsible for securing their own power.
"We're still trying to figure that out," said an aide to Assembly Speaker Pro 
Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. "We don't know how to get around that right 
now." 
Keeley is expected to introduce legislation to shift the burden of rescuing 
Southern California Edison to large businesses. Under the proposal, which is 
also supported by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, customers that use 500 
kilowatt-hours of power a month or more would pay a surcharge on their bills 
to help Southern California Edison recoup its losses on wholesale power. 
The so-called direct-access component - under those large users would buy 
their power from suppliers - is the cornerstone of the Keeley plan, for which 
Enron has been lobbying hard in recent weeks, according to several aides to 
key legislators. 
The Keeley plan is an alternative to the memorandum of understanding Gov. 
Gray Davis signed with Southern California Edison two months ago. Under that 
proposal, the state would buy Southern California Edison's power lines for 
$2.76 billion and allow the utility to issue $2 billion in bonds backed by 
ratepayers to recover $3.5 billion in net uncollected power costs. 
That plan has run into snags in the Legislature, which must enact it into 
law, and the PUC, which has been slow to rule on enabling measures. 
One key Democratic Senator said the PUC's move to quash direct access is an 
attempt to ensure a deal to rescue Southern California Edison doesn't pass 
through the Legislature. 
"The PUC has demonstrated it does not want SoCal Ed to remain solvent," the 
senator said. "They have dragged their feet on several key issues they need 
to address in order to make sure legislation to save the utility is never 
heard." 
A PUC spokesman didn't return calls for comment. 
Direct-access was the key part of the state's 1996 deregulation law, giving 
retail customers the opportunity to choose from a variety of energy suppliers 
in an effort to lower their electric rates. 
Commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque said they support direct access 
and would vote against any measure to reverse it. 
"I would never vote against direct access," said Bilas, a Republican, who 
authored the agenda item. Bilas said the item was amended by another 
commissioner. 
The measure could be held, because it might disrupt negotiations between the 
Legislature and Southern California Edison, said PUC Commissioner Geoffrey 
Brown, a Democrat. 
The PUC may be looking to protect the state's interest as a power purchaser, 
some legislative aides said. 
The DWR's long-term power supply contracts cover the state's wholesale-market 
power needs in 2002 and 2003. If large industrial customers were to sign 
direct-access contracts, the DWR would lose them as customers and thus fail 
to collect enough revenue to pay off the long-term contracts. 
The agency could be stuck with a large surplus of electricity that it would 
be forced to sell it on the open market at a loss. The market price of power 
in the coming years is expected to be lower than what the state paid for 
forward power in 2001. 
Wholesale power prices plunged this week, and the DWR for the first time sold 
excess power on the open market, according to Oscar Hidalgo, DWR spokesman. 
Arnold Rosenthal, of Newport Beach-based Utility Resource Management Group, 
an organization that represents more than 700 large electricity users in the 
state, said state regulators are "looking to get us back into a mode where we 
are held captive once again." 
"The DWR is acting as this super utility," Rosenthal said. "What you're left 
with is absolutely no choice. Instead, we'll be subjected to several large 
rate increases." 
Rosenthal said some of his San Diego clients have direct access deals. A 
number of clients served by Southern California Edison want to sign 
direct-access contracts to escape recent rate increases imposed by the PUC.

Enron's Lenders Consider Closure of Indian Project (Update6)
2001-06-07 16:13 (New York)

Enron's Lenders Consider Closure of Indian Project (Update6)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Mumbai, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- Industrial Development Bank of
India, ABN Amro Holding NV and other lenders to Enron Corp.'s $3
billion Indian power project are considering a plan to shut the
plant for as long as a year until a tariff dispute is settled.
     The lenders hired Stone & Webster, a U.S. engineering
company, to determine the costs and consequences of temporarily
closing Dabhol Power Co.'s plant, said R.S. Agarwal, executive
director of Industrial Development Bank of India.
     Indian banks, which have loaned $1.4 billion to Enron's
Dabhol Power, have the most at stake in salvaging the project, the
country's biggest foreign investment. The $600 million lent by ABN
Amro, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and other banks are
covered by government guarantees, while Indian bank loans are not.
     ``We may have to go for a mothballing of the project, which
means preservation of assets and removal of workers,'' said
Agarwal, the spokesman for Enron's lenders, who will decide on a
closure after Stone & Webster submits its report within a week.
     A solution to the dispute can only be found if all parties
are willing to make ``sacrifices,'' said Rumy Kanga, senior
general manager at Tata Power Ltd., which supplies power mainly to
industrial consumers in Mumbai. ``Lenders will have to take a
cut'' on the cost of their loans to Dabhol.

                      Completing Construction

     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, is owed 3 billion rupees
($64 million) by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for power supplied in December and January.
     The board has refused to pay, saying Dabhol's price is more
than double the rate charged by other Indian generators, and has
stopped buying power from Dabhol. It also charged Dabhol an 8-
billion rupee penalty for not supplying power at full capacity on
three days between January and March.
     Enron, the largest energy trader, has no plans for
renegotiating Dabhol's power-purchase agreement with the
Maharashtra board, company spokesman John Ambler said Friday.
     Dabhol pays 16.5 percent annual interest on the $1.4 billion
worth of rupee loans. That's more than the 11.5 percent banks
charge their best customers.
     The lenders to Dabhol, who met for a third day in Singapore,
discussed consequences of a temporary closure. Loan disbursements
of $280 million to the second phase of the project, which was to
add 1,444 megawatts of capacity, were also discussed.
     ``We've told Dabhol a closure at this stage, when 95 percent
of the construction work is over, will push up the cost of power
even further,'' Agarwal said. ``We've suggested construction and
mechanical work at the project be allowed to continue.''

                      `Keeping Project Alive'

     Dabhol should carry through with its proposal to ``suspend''
the project only if a buyer for its power is not found after the
construction is finished, Agarwal said.
    ``Foreign lenders and Dabhol are not interested in keeping the
project alive because there's no assurance that there will be
another buyer (for the power) and the power purchase agreement has
been rescinded,'' Agarwal said. ``The legal position adopted by
both the parties has complicated the issue.''
     Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee yesterday said it
would be difficult to find buyers for Dabhol's power because it's
too expensive, newspapers and news agencies reported.
     ``The difficulty (about the high cost of power) facing
Maharashtra will be for other states as well. What is to be done
about such costly power?'' he was quoted as saying.
     India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in
fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and
loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.
     Joahn Zaayman, an Enron spokesman in India, declined to
comment on the lenders meeting.

                          Enron and India

     Shares of Enron fell $1.81, or 3.5 percent, to close at
$50.52 after touching a 52-week low of $48.80. Stocks of
California power suppliers have fallen since late May on concern
that the companies won't be paid as part of Pacific Gas &
Electric's bankruptcy filing, analysts said.
     ``It looks like the sector is taking it on the chin to begin
with, and Enron looks like it's leading the charge down because of
the news in India,'' said Andre Meade, a utility analyst at
Commerzbank Securities in New York.
     Houston-based Enron has been moving away from infrastructure
projects, such as power plants and pipelines, to focus on trading
natural gas, electricity and other commodities.
     Enron shares have fallen 39 percent this year. In addition to
the India project, investors have been concerned about California
power sales and its telecommunications unit, said Neal Dingmann, a
Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst in Dallas.
     Enron is owed $400 million to $500 million by California
power purchasers, Chairman Kenneth Lay said this week. Most of
that is owed by PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, which filed
for bankruptcy protection in April. Enron's broadband unit, which
has a fiber-optic network and helps trade space on such networks,
had a first-quarter loss of $35 million on revenue of $83 million.
     India ``is a distant third'' in factors moving Enron shares,
Dingmann said.


California Spending Less on Power, May Renegotiate, Reports Say
2001-06-07 14:11 (New York)


     Sacramento, California, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- The California
Department of Water Resources reduced by $630 million the amount
it is spending for power under long-term contracts and may back
away from other term offers above current market rates, reports
said.
     The department said in a posting on its Web site that the
average amount it is paying for power for five-year contracts is
$84 a megawatt-hour. It previously estimated $86 a megawatt-hour,
Dow Jones Newswires reported. A megawatt-hour can light 750
California homes for an hour.
     In the past two months, the forward price of electricity has
fallen, enabling the department to sign contracts at lower rates,
Dow Jones said. The state has agreed to contracts with 20
suppliers, including Duke Energy Corp., Calpine Corp., Enron
Corp., Williams Cos. and Dynegy Inc.
     The department has signed 38 contracts to purchase
electricity for the next 10 years and 23 still are being
negotiated, the San Francisco Chronicle said. Ray Hart, deputy
director of the department, said the state will demand more
favorable prices or drop some of the contracts still being
negotiated, the newspaper reported.
     The state has spend more than $7 billion buying electricity
on behalf of its two largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison.
The utilities have racked up more than $14 billion in debt buying
power at soaring prices that couldn't be passed to customers.
     Shares of PG&E rose $1.03 to $12.10 in midafternoon trading.
Edison shares rose $1.02 to $11.



Enron, DuPont Urge Bush to Salvage Environmental Pact (Update1)
2001-06-07 13:15 (New York)

Enron, DuPont Urge Bush to Salvage Environmental Pact (Update1)

     (Adds White House comment on global warming report in
seventh, eighth paragraphs.)

     Washington, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., DuPont Co.,
American Electric Power Co. and other U.S. companies that have
taken voluntary steps to limit greenhouse gas emissions are urging
the Bush administration to salvage at least parts of the 1997
Kyoto global warming treaty.
     These companies ``very much like the Kyoto framework and hope
that there is a way to preserve the best parts and fix the parts
that need to be fixed,'' said Eileen Claussen, executive director
of the Pew Center for Global Climate Change, whose 33 members also
include Alcoa Inc., Holnam Inc. and BP Plc.
     President George W. Bush decided in February to oppose
regulation of the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to
global warming and to abandon the Kyoto accord.
     When U.S. allies in Europe objected, the administration
created a task force to come up with a counter proposal to reduce
harmful emissions. Bush travels to Europe next week for
discussions that will include global warming.
     The task force, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, hasn't
made a recommendation yet, White House officials said, though it
is considering a voluntary system that sets incentives and targets
for greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
     Pressure on the administration to act increased yesterday
when the National Academy of Scientists released a report that
said the threat of global warming is real and will have an impact
on economic growth and public health. The NAS study had been
requested by the Bush administration.

                       White House Reaction

     The president agrees that the earth's temperature is rising
and ``is committed to reducing global warming,'' White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer said today, responding to questions about
the report.
      ``There is still some remaining question about what the
cause is,'' he said, ``how much of that rise is as a result of man-
made factors.''
     The corporations that want Bush to act have been lobbying the
task force, saying regulation of carbon dioxide emissions is
inevitable. They don't want to have to deal with an international
patchwork of regulations, and they want to benefit from the anti-
pollution steps they've already taken, Claussen said.
     Other businesses, such as Exxon Mobil Corp., are arguing
against reviving Kyoto. They say the treaty is flawed because it
exempts developing nations from emission limits and that it would
damage the U.S. economy.
     The U.S. was among the 167 countries that signed the treaty,
which calls for industrial countries to cut smokestack emissions
by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The Clinton
administration never presented it to the U.S. Senate for
ratification because of congressional opposition, and Bush in
March declared the treaty dead.

                          Trading Credits

     For corporations favoring an international approach, part of
the appeal is economic.
     DuPont, for example, has embraced scientific evidence of
rising global temperatures caused by carbon dioxide and other
emissions. The second largest chemical maker says it has cut its
greenhouse emissions by 50 percent since 1992 through relatively
low-cost improvements in plastics manufacturing.
     The company favors several provisions of the Kyoto accord,
including a system that would allow companies that exceed their
emissions targets to sell credits to dirtier companies.
      The company also wants to include ``credit for early
action'' that would reward its environmental efforts with tax
credits or amnesty from future regulation.
     ``We view this as a global issue that requires a global
response,'' said Thomas Jacob, who oversees DuPont's climate
change program.

                          Future Markets

     Although U.S. withdrawal from mandatory controls would appear
to let U.S. polluters off the hook, it may give European companies
an advantage to ``move more quickly toward being viable in the
future marketplace'' of clean energy sources, he said.
     Other companies such as Alcoa, BP, and Ford Motor Co. say
they view the scientific evidence of climate change to be
overwhelming and are positioning themselves for eventual controls
on carbon dioxide emissions.
     BP has set a target of cutting greenhouse gases 10 percent
below 1990 levels by 2010. It has already cut them 5 percent by
cutting methane leaks from wellheads, an effort that will
``improve profitability,'' said BP's Jeff Morgheim, who is working
on the company's climate change program.
     BP, whose chief executive John Browne visited the White House
in February, has ``been careful not to say anything'' about the
Kyoto Protocol, Morgheim said.
     Jacob said DuPont is concerned that if other countries ratify
Kyoto without the U.S. its overseas operations would be placed
under different regulations.
     ``Those of us who are multinationals could be caught in the
middle,'' Jacob said. ``What we need to do is capture some of the
positive contributions that have come out of the negotiations and
build on those.''
     Some members of the Pew group have pitched their stance
directly to the Bush administration. Executives from American
Electric Power, Enron, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Detroit Edison,
all of them Pew members, have visited the White House to advocate
regulating carbon dioxide.
     ``They've been pretty active in terms of trying to get their
views known,'' said Claussen.

                         Against Mandates

     The White House also is being pressed by the other side.
Companies that are members of the United States Council for
International Business, including Exxon Mobil, say Bush would be
unwise to go back to Kyoto, and should supplant mandatory cuts in
greenhouse gases in favor of voluntary programs.
     The group, which represents 300 companies, wrote Bush May 11
calling for voluntary efforts rather than ``rigid, mandated caps,
targets, timetables and command and control regulations,''
president Thomas M.T. Niles said in the letter.
     ``I don't think the business community will ever support
internationally mandated reductions,'' said Bill Kovacs, who
handles environmental issues at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
     National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said Bush will
share his views about global warming in meetings next week with
leaders of the European Union in Gothenburg, Sweden. ``He really
wants to talk about the seriousness of the problem and how to
address it,'' she said.
     An administration official said Bush's plans will include
voluntary measures to curb global warming, including an emissions
trading system, helping power plants improve their equipment, and
protecting farms and forests that absorb greenhouse gases.
     Kevin Fay, executive director of International Climate Change
Partnership, who is advising the White House, said Bush hopes to
have a policy finished by July 15. That's when U.S. officials will
join talks in Bonn in which European countries hope to revive the
Kyoto treaty. There is also a meeting of G-8 ministers on July 20.
     U.S. businesses are ``very concerned with the potential
appearance of this community doing nothing,'' said Fay. ``There's
a lot of potential in the outline of Kyoto.''



`Obsolete' Stock-Picking Tool Gives 52% Return: John Dorfman
2001-06-07 12:48 (New York)

`Obsolete' Stock-Picking Tool Gives 52% Return: John Dorfman

     (Commentary. John Dorfman, president of Dorfman
Investments in Boston, is a columnist for Bloomberg News.
The opinions expressed are his own.  His firm or its clients
may own or trade investments discussed in this column.)

     Boston, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- AT&T Corp. and AMR Corp.
look like great buys according to an old-fashioned stock-
picking tool, the price-to-book ratio.
     Why should anyone care about stocks picked by such an
antique method? Because it still works, that's why.
     A year ago, I recommended seven stocks selling below
book value. They were Azurix Corp., Gaylord Entertainment
Co., Loews Corp., McDermott International Inc., Raytheon
Co., Saks Inc. and Tommy Hilfiger Corp. From June 8, 2000
through Wednesday's close these seven stocks rose an average
of 52 percent. Over the same period, the Standard & Poor's
500 Index fell 11 percent.
     The best performer was Hong Kong-based clothing maker
Tommy Hilfiger Inc., which surged 117 percent. I own this
stock for some clients. Despite its big rise, it's selling
for less than 11 times earnings.
     The worst performer was Saks Inc., up 8.4 percent. The
Birmingham, Alabama, retailer has shown anemic profits in
the past four quarters, though I continue to see power in
its collection of brand-name department stores, such as Saks
Fifth Avenue, Carson Pirie Scott and Boston Store.

                      Nothing's Perfect

     Returns for the other five stocks were 108 percent for
Loews, 43 percent for McDermott, 41 percent for Raytheon, 26
percent for Gaylord and 23 percent for Azurix, which was
acquired by Enron Corp. (My clients own Loews, McDermott and
Raytheon.)
     Book value is simply corporate net worth. Take a
company's assets, subtract its liabilities and you have book
value. The price-to-book ratio is the stock price divided by
the book value per share of outstanding stock.
     Critics say book value is tainted or distorted by
corporate write-offs, inflation, or unrealistic depreciation
techniques. That's true to some degree. It was never a
perfect tool and nothing ever captures a complex reality
completely. But many, from the late Benjamin Graham on, have
successfully used book value for stock picking. It's still
useful, as this year's results attest.
     Frankly, I have no expectation of beating the S&P by 66
percentage points again over the coming year. But I think
investors who buy this year's selection of low price-to-book
stocks will probably be happy they did.

                            AT&T

     In addition to AT&T and AMR, I recommend Dillard's
Inc., Blockbuster Inc., Security Capital Group Inc., and
Kmart Inc. I reiterate my recommendation of Saks. All seven
are selling for less than book value.
     AT&T remains the nation's largest telephone company,
but it is increasingly a cable company, providing cable
television and rapid Internet service. Its stock has fallen
from about $60 in early 1999 to $21.65 today, which works
out to just 0.79 times book value.
     The biggest depressant for AT&T stock is the rate war
in long-distance voice service. I predict that within two
years a major competitor will withdraw from that field,
leading to better pricing for the remaining players. I hope,
however, that the market anticipates such a development in
advance because some of my clients own AT&T call options
that expire next January.
     AMR, like many airline stocks, has fallen because of
high prices for fuel, planes and labor. Revenue so far is
fine, but investors fear that a recession will reverse the
thrust.
     Teleconferencing and Internet conferencing are also
perceived as threats to business travel. Even with all the
problems, AMR looks cheap to me at 10 times earnings and 0.8
times book value.

                         Blockbuster

     Dillard's is a department store chain based in Little
Rock, Arkansas. It owns about 340 stores, mostly in the
Southeast, Southwest and Midwest. The stock fetches only
0.55 times book value. Analysts expect earnings to total
only $1.28 this fiscal year, the lowest in a decade. But the
company has demonstrated earnings power: It earned more than
$2 a share in six of the seven years from 1993 through 1999.
At $16.88, the stock looks bargain-priced to me.
     Blockbuster, based in Dallas, Texas, is the nation's
largest video rental company. Its stock has climbed 146
percent this year, yet still sells for 0.6 times book value.
Critics dismiss the company as a dinosaur, saying that soon
everyone will have video on demand by cable or satellite. I
doubt it. More likely, I think, is a slow transition from
old technologies to new ones. Blockbuster had free cash flow
of $6.28 a share in 2000 and the stock sells for only 3.5
times that figure.
     Security Capital, based in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
invests in real estate, manages real-estate properties, and
sells real-estate research. It earned $2.75 a share in the
fiscal year that ended in February; analysts expect it to
earn about a dime less this fiscal year. At the current
price of $21.27, the stock sells for just 6 times earnings
and 0.7 times book.
                            Kmart

      People will laugh at me for recommending Kmart, which
has declined about 39 percent during the past ten years. In
that decade, the S&P 500 has more than quadruped. Laughter
or not, the Troy, Michigan-based retailer is selling for
0.87 times book value and 0.14 times revenue. I think a
company that could shape it up and run it better may buy it.
     As for Saks, it earned 99 cents a share in the fiscal
year that ended in March, down from $1.64 the year before.
In the current fiscal year analysts expect earnings to
decline another 7 percent.
     With brands such as Proffitt's, McRae's, Younkers,
Parisian, Herberger's, Bergner's and Off 5th, in addition to
the ones mentioned above, I think Saks has the potential for
successful restructuring and creative financial engineering.
The stock sells for only 0.72 times book.


California to Utilize Lower Electricity Prices, Paper Reports
2001-06-07 11:04 (New York)


     San Francisco, June 7 (Bloomberg) -- California state
officials are prepared to use an unexpected drop in electricity
prices to forego almost two-dozen long-term power contracts priced
at above-market rates, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
     Two weeks ago, officials were at the whim of power companies
and were desperate for available megawatts, the paper said.
     The California Department of Water Resources already signed
38 contracts to purchase electricity at fixed prices over the next
decade, the paper said.
     The state may not need all of the other 23 contracts, or
about 40 percent of the total agreements, that are in
negotiations, the paper reported.

I am resending the same file as before (although to a larger group) and  need 
to make a correction regarding one assumption.  I am told the analysis does 
not yet include the gas indexed contracts.  We're working on getting them  
included and when they are, the overmarket value will likely increase.

Subject: DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
"mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Dramatic drop in cost of electricity/LOWER BILLS: Cheaper fuel, milder 
weather credited
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer


   California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest
level in more than a year, partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in
prices for natural gas, which fuels most power plants.
   Make no mistake: Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in
months ahead.
   But for the first time since California's energy markets went haywire last
summer, industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally
may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs.
   "California is not yet out of the woods," said Kelley Doolan, who tracks
natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts. "But this is a
very significant decrease in costs."
   Along with lower gas prices, the decline in electricity costs was
attributed by state and industry officials to milder weather, which
reduces demand for power. They also credited recent conservation efforts
by consumers and better-than-expected runoff at dams for hydroelectric
plants.
   Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an
energy-industry association, said these factors came together to produce
the lowest wholesale electricity prices since April 2000.
   Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as
little as $50 per megawatt hour, he noted, compared with more than $500
earlier this year.
   "If the weather stays this way, we could have reasonable prices all
summer, " Ackerman said. "We may also have fewer blackouts."
   It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in
energy prices. If power companies manipulated prices on the way up, as
critics have alleged, might they not be up to some trick as prices head in
the opposite direction?
   Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San
Francisco, speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to
fall so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active
role in the dysfunctional California market.
   "They're trying to take the heat off," she said.
   Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a
statistical blip.
   "This was just one month's decline," said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. "We really
have to see how this plays out in the future."
   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor was
very encouraged by the lower energy prices. Davis announced Sunday that
California's power use was down 11 percent last month from a year before.
   "We're not there yet," Maviglio said of whether an end to the state's
power woes is in sight. "But the trend is pointing in the right
direction."
   WHITE ELEPHANT
   Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side: California
could end up with a huge white elephant after spending about $40 billion
in public funds on long-term power contracts.
   The logic behind the contracts, which are at an average price of $69 per
megawatt hour over 10 years, is that the state expected to pay
below-market rates for electricity for a number of years before prices
came down and California found itself paying above-market rates.
   If current trends continue, though, California will find itself paying
consistently above-market rates much sooner than expected, making the
long- term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that
profited so handsomely during the state's darkest hours.
   "The contracts look really ugly right now," said Shames at the Utility
Consumers' Action Network. "They may be way overpriced."
   Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said it is too early to conclude that
the state did poorly negotiating dozens of long-term power contracts.
   "No one has a crystal ball on this," he said.
   CUSTOMERS' BILLS TO DROP
   In any case, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said yesterday that customers'
average gas bills will drop 26 percent this month to $26 and should stay
near that level all summer.
   Platts, which monitors average monthly spot prices, found that the
wholesale price of gas at the California-Oregon border has tumbled nearly
42 percent since the beginning of May -- from $9.98 per million British
thermal units to $5.81.
   The wholesale gas price at the California-Arizona border fell 45 percent,
from $11.91 to $6.50. This compares with a 25 percent monthly decline in
average natural gas prices nationwide.
   However, California gas prices are still about 50 percent higher than they
were a year ago, whereas national prices are now below year-ago levels for
the first time since last spring.
   While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall,
Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a
commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long, hot
summer of rolling blackouts.
   "You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer,"
he said. "That created enormous demand for electricity generation.
   "What has changed is that we've had weeks of mild weather," Doolan
observed.
   "The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up
all the gas."
   This allowed utilities like PG&E to beef up gas inventories, which eased
demand and resulted in substantially lower prices, he said.
   'BACK ON TRACK'
   "We're back on track to be completely full for winter," said Staci Homrig,
a PG&E spokeswoman. "That's a very good thing."
   Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again
in the winter. PG&E is forecasting that customers' average gas bills could
rise to as high as $75 in December if current trends continue.
   However, the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that
California's unusually high costs at last may be abating.
   Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether
the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs.

		 Subject: Report: CA Energy Crisis Overshadows Success Of PJM


NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : July 3, 2001
Report: CA Energy Crisis Overshadows Success Of PJM 
While some may argue that California's energy woes offer a prime reason for 
placing the electric competition genie firmly back in its bottle, a recent 
case study by a global consulting group asserts that California's energy 
difficulties mask the fact that other power markets in the United States are 
not only surviving, but thriving, with the PJM market serving as the perfect 
example. 
The report by PA Consulting, "PJM - Electric Power Competition That Works," 
notes that in the wake of California's energy crisis, the future of electric 
power restructuring and deregulation in the United States is increasingly 
being called into question. The growing national debate over the fate of 
electric power restructuring is couched more and more in stark terms of "to 
be, or not to be." But PA Consulting argues that this "simplistic debate" 
presents the nation with the choice of either pushing ahead with 
restructuring and potentially facing California-like difficulties in other 
parts of the country or reverting back to a more intrusive, 
command-and-control regulatory system. 
In PA Consulting's view, limiting the national debate to these two extremes 
ignores the fact that California is not the typical model for competitive 
wholesale electricity markets. "Indeed, there are several competitive 
wholesale markets at work in the United States that differ significantly from 
California's in both structure and results." One of the most "dynamic, robust 
and successful" of these other regional wholesale electricity markets is the 
Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market in the mid-Atlantic region, the 
study asserts. "Understanding why the PJM model has succeeded in many areas 
where the California model has failed may provide regulators, legislators and 
other interested groups with a powerful reference point in the growing debate 
concerning whether continued market reform in the electric power industry is 
in our future." 
The report notes that PJM offers an interesting example for a competitive 
market case study because it is similar in size to the California market and 
has a longer track record of spot market operations. While there are 
similarities in market size and spot market longevity, significant 
differences exist between PJM and California in terms of regulatory 
jurisdiction and market composition, according to PA Consulting. 
More specifically, the study points out that in terms of regulatory 
authority, the PJM market -- unlike California's -- overlaps the jurisdiction 
of five states and the District of Columbia. In some ways, the multiple 
regulatory jurisdictions within PJM have allowed the market and market 
operator to remain largely independent of any one regulatory authority. In 
contrast, single-state markets such as California and New York have state 
regulators and legislatures that wield considerable influence and a stronger 
sense of ownership of the market and its actions, the study adds. Some have 
argued that this control has been exerted to the detriment of market function 
and independence, while FERC has been troubled by single-state control, the 
study went on to say. 
By way of comparison, the PJM experience illustrates that, in a market 
operating across multiple jurisdictions, no single state can dictate 
conditions. In such an environment, the wholesale market will be regulated 
primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, reducing the influence 
of state politics and allowing the market to adopt a broader regional 
perspective, the study notes. 
"This case study provides a powerful counterpoint to those who would like to 
turn back the clock on electric power competition," said Phillip Harris, CEO 
of PJM. "Our market model provides a blueprint for a working competitive 
marketplace that has been refined during four years of successful operation."

PENNSYLVANIA -- PUC conditionally supports Verizon interLATA bid

The Public Utility Commission today lent its support to Verizon
Pennsylvania, Inc.'s application to provide in-region interLATA
(local access and transport area) services, subject to several
conditions to ensure market competition.  Today's decision
concludes a formal investigation that began when Verizon
requested the commission's support in January.  (1/9/01)

In a 3-2 vote, the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a
permanent assurance plan with "self-executing" remedies based on
the New York model already accepted by the FCC and to increased
penalties for failure to meet performance standards.  Verizon
said that it will accept these conditions and that it plans to
file its interLATA bid with the FCC "shortly."

Commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Terrance J. Fitzpatrick
dissented.  Commissioner Brownell said, "I cannot, in good
conscience, affirm that these markets are open as envisioned
under the [federal Telecommunications Act of 1996]."  Both
dissenting commissioners listed several areas in which Verizon
had failed to meet the FCC requirements to determine that local
markets are open to competition.

A WorldCom, Inc., spokesman told TR, "We agree with the
dissenters and hope the FCC will recognize that problems still
exist and force Verizon to fix them prior to allowing them to
offer long distance."

Once Verizon files its market-entry bid with the FCC, the PUC
will present its recommendation.  Section 271 of the Act requires
the FCC to consult with the U.S. Department of Justice and
relevant state regulators before ruling on such applications.
(Docket no. M-00001435, Consultative Report on Application of
Verizon Pennsylvania Inc., for FCC Authorization to Provide In-
Region, InterLATA Service in Pennsylvania)

CONNECTICUT -- SNET challenges city's telecom certification

Southern New England Telecommunications (SNET) has filed an
appeal in Superior Court (New Britain) challenging the Department
of Public Utility Control's decision to grant the city of Groton
a certificate to provide telecom access services.  (Docket no.
00-03-12)

SNET argues that Groton "is not legally empowered to offer
telecommunications services to those who are not inhabitants of
its electric service area" under Connecticut General Statutes =0F5
7-233i.  Groton's customers as defined in its application would
all be noninhabitants, SNET said.

In its April 11 decision, the DPUC agreed with Groton's argument
that "[the statute] has no language prohibiting a municipality
from offering wholesale telecommunications service."

______________________________________________________

TENNESSEE -- BellSouth to ask TRA to support market-entry bid
soon

BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., has notified the Regulatory
Authority that it plans to request support for its bid to enter
the Tennessee interLATA (local access and transport area) market
"by the end of July."  Compliance with the 14-point "competitive
checklist" of section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act
is a prerequisite for FCC authorization to provide in-region
interLATA service.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department
of Justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on the
applications.

BellSouth asked the TRA to schedule hearings on its application
for the first week of November.  BellSouth asked the TRA to
support its section 271 bid in 1997, but the company withdrew the
request before the TRA could decide whether to endorse it, a TRA
staff member told TR.

MICHIGAN -- PSC adopts '616' area code 'split'

The Public Service Commission yesterday approved a geographic
"split" to relieve number exhaustion in the "616" area code.

A north/south geographic split will be implemented with a
dividing line that follows the northern boundaries of Saugatuck,
Hamilton, Hopkins, Wayland, Middleville, Hastings, and Woodland
rate centers.  Customers in and to the south of these rate
centers will receive a new area code.  Customers to the north of
the rate centers will retain 616.

Permissive dialing will begin by July 13, 2002, and mandatory
dialing will begin Feb. 15, 2003.  Wireless carriers will have an
extended permissive dialing period through Feb. 15, 2004.  (Case
no. U-12850)

______________________________________________________

NEW YORK -- Nassau County restricts use of wireless phones

Nassau County today enacted an ordinance requiring the use of
hands-free devices when operating wireless phones while driving.
"Although mobile phones provide convenience for our busy lives,
their use must conform with the need for public safety," Nassau
County Executive Thomas Gulotta said.

Emergency calls to police, fire, ambulance, or health care
providers are exempt from the requirement.  The ordinance
authorizes the police department to fine up to $100 per
violation, a Nassau County spokesperson told TR.  The ordinance
takes effect July 1.

______________________________________________________

WEST VIRGINIA -- Verizon to appeal $18M access-rate reduction

Verizon West Virginia, Inc., yesterday said it plans to ask the
Public Service Commission to reconsider an order requiring
Verizon to reduce its access rates by $18 million over three
years.  The PSC's order addressed an AT&T Corp. complaint.  While
the reduction is smaller than the $27.6 million suggested by
AT&T, it's larger than the $6 million cut Verizon proposed.

Verizon said that, if given the chance, it would demonstrate that
the PSC was "misguided in seeking to mirror in-state and
interstate access rates."  The telco said the order gives AT&T
and other long distance companies a free ride on its network at
the expense of consumers.

The PSC ordered the access charge reductions to be passed through
to West Virginia toll customers.  Verizon responded, "People
shouldn't hold their breath waiting for AT&T to pass along any
savings."  (Case no. 00-0318-T-C, AT&T Communications of West
Virginia, Inc. v. Bell Atlantic-West Virginia, Inc.)

______________________________________________________

CALIFORNIA -- Wood proposes 'anticramming' rules

Public Utilities Commissioner Charles Wood has proposed rules to
regulate the inclusion of noncommunications charges on phone
bills.  Existing law, which authorizes only communications-
related charges on phone bills, is scheduled to expire July 1.
(1/5/01)  The proposed rules are designed to prevent "cramming,"
which is the placement of unauthorized charges on phone bills.

The proposed rules require telecom companies to obtain a
customer's written consent before including noncommunications
charges on phone bills.  Customers may revoke their consent at
any time without charge and may identify a dollar maximum per
charge and per billing cycle on noncommunications charges.
Telecom companies may not disconnect or threaten to disconnect
basic local phone service for nonpayment of noncommunications
charges.

Under the proposed rules, telecom companies must take
"reasonable" precautions to screen vendors and billing agents
before agreeing to provide noncommunications billing services for
them.  Noncommunications charges must be identified in a separate
section of phone bills.  Comments are due June 20.  (Rulemaking
00-02-004)

MISSOURI -- House passes rights-of-way bill

The House has passed a bill restricting local governments'
authority to regulate public rights-of-way.  The measure now goes
to Gov. Bob Holden (D.).  Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and
competitive local exchange carriers support the bill, but the
Missouri Municipal League "fought the bill tooth and nail," a
league spokesperson told TR.

SB 369 would prohibit local governments from requiring telecom
companies to obtain a franchise to use rights-of-way but would
grandfather franchise agreements in effect May 1.  The bill would
prohibit rights-of-way rental fees but would authorize local
governments to impose rights-of-way permit fees, which would be
limited to "actual, substantiated costs reasonably incurred" in
managing the public rights-of-way.

Local governments would have to process rights-of-way permit
applications within 31 days after receiving a complete
application.  Telecom and cable TV companies would be authorized
to identify rights-of-way permit fees on customer bills.

______________________________________________________

GEORGIA -- WorldCom says FX calls subject to 'recip comp'

WorldCom, Inc., has asked the Public Service Commission to
determine that calls originated by BellSouth Telecommunications,
Inc.'s customers to competitive local exchange carriers' foreign-
exchange (FX) customers should be considered local and therefore
subject to reciprocal compensation.  Proper treatment of FX
traffic is required to meet item 13 (reciprocal compensation) of
section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996's 14-
point "competitive checklist," MCI said.

Treating CLECs' FX traffic as long distance provides "significant
competitive advantages" to BellSouth because it permits BellSouth
to assess access charges on local calls and "shields BellSouth's
local FX service from competition," WorldCom said.  (Docket no.
6863-U)

______________________________________________________

CALIFORNIA -- ALJ suggests requiring Pacific Bell to permit
intraLATA toll presubscription

Administrative Law Judge Karen Jones has recommended that the
Public Utilities Commission require Pacific Bell to permit
MCImetro Access Transmission Services LLC's customers to
presubscribe to Pacific Bell's intraLATA (local access and
transport area) long distance service.  The recommendation was
made in a draft arbitrator's report about the companies'
interconnection agreement.

Pacific Bell said the requirement would be confusing to customers
and would require the company to identify a separate billing
channel or generate a bill solely for intraLATA long distance
service.

"It is blatantly discriminatory for Pacific to refuse to provide
intraLATA toll service to MCI's local service customers," Ms.
Jones said.  She said, "Pacific's arguments of 'customer
confusion' and 'billing' concerns do not have merit."  "Customers
could receive three different bills for the three different
services, and other carriers cope with billing for only one of
those three services.  There is no reason that Pacific should not
be able to provide a bill which includes only intraLATA
services."  Comments on the draft arbitrator's report are due
June 20.  (Application 01-01-010)

______________________________________________________

CALIFORNIA -- PUC extends deadline for Pacific Bell interLATA
filing

Public Utilities Commissioner Geoffrey Brown has extended Pacific
Bell's deadline for filing information demonstrating its
compliance with the interLATA (local access and transport area)
market-entry requirements of section 709.2 of California code.
The section requires the PUC to find that permitting Pacific Bell
to enter the California interLATA market doesn't harm the long
distance market substantially.  The commission also must find
that Pacific Bell's entry is based on fully open local exchange
access and that the company isn't engaging in anticompetitive
behavior or improper cross-subsidization.  (5/7/01)

Pacific Bell asked the PUC to extend the deadline from June 4
until "mid-June," when the company plans to file its section 271
application with the PUC.  Mr. Brown granted the company's
request and said he would establish a comment filing schedule
after Pacific has filed its section 709.2 assessment and section
271 application.  (Rulemaking nos. 93-04-003 and 95-04-043 and
Investigation nos. 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)

IOWA -- Board mulls revoking LTDS's certificate

The Utilities Board has ordered LTDS Corp. to demonstrate why its
operating certificate shouldn't be revoked.  The board is
concerned that "actions on the part of LTDS do not appear to be
the actions of a bona fide competitive local exchange carrier."

The board said there appears to be no voice traffic from or to an
LTDS customer in any exchange other than Fairfield.  The company
ordered and then cancelled orders for voice trunks in the Pella,
Chariton, and Centerville exchanges.  It ordered trunks in the
Grinnell and Sigourney exchanges, although it has no assigned
"NXX" codes there.  The company's tariff also fails to include a
residential rate.  It was deleted in a Jan. 19 tariff revision,
the board said.

It said state law obligates each local exchange utility to serve
all eligible customers within the utility's service territory,
unless explicitly excepted from the requirement by the board.
(Iowa Code section 476.29(5))

LTDS must file direct testimony by June 22.  Petitions to
intervene are due July 3.  Additional comments from the consumer
advocate and intervenors are due July 17.  Prepared rebuttal
testimony from LTDS will be due Aug. 3.  A hearing is scheduled
for Aug. 14.  (Docket no. TCU-01-13 - In Re: LTDS Corporation)

NEBRASKA -- PSC to discuss implementing '511'

The Public Service Commission has scheduled an Aug. 15 workshop
to address implementation of the "511" dialing code as an
Advanced Traveler Weather Information System (ATWIS).  It will
provide route-specific weather forecasts and road condition
reports to callers based on specific location information they
provide.

The PSC approved implementation of 511 for the ATWIS May 23.  The
commission directed the Department of Roads and the Nebraska
State Patrol to begin deploying the ATWIS.  (Application no. C-
2506/PI-48 - In the Matter of the Application of the Commission,
on its own motion, to seek comment on the establishment and
implementation of '511' as a statewide three-digit calling number
reserved for access to ATWIS)

______________________________________________________

NEBRASKA -- PSC seeks copies of MDU contracts

The Public Service Commission has requested by June 15 copies of
all contracts that all certified telecom carriers have entered
into with multiple dwelling units (MDUs).

In April 1999 the PSC issued an order clarifying its policy for
residential MDU access.  Qwest Corp. appealed the PSC's order to
the Nebraska Supreme Court, which affirmed a majority of it.  The
court remanded to the PSC the issue of whether the rates it set
for MDU access comply with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit's (St. Louis) decision in Iowa Utilities Board v.
FCC (120 F. 3d 753).

After reviewing the case's testimony, the PSC said it's
"disturbed" that some telecom carriers still may be utilizing
contracts with MDUs that contain exclusive access and/or
exclusive marketing provisions "in apparent blatant disregard of
prior orders of this commission, as well as the FCC."  (Docket
no. C-2534/PI-50 - The Commission, on its own motion, to examine
the potential noncompliance with Commission orders entered in
Docket no. C-1878/PI-23)

CONNECTICUT -- DPUC expands Lifeline assistance in tribal areas

The Department of Public Utility Control has amended its Lifeline
plan to enhance assistance to individuals living on American
Indian tribal lands.  The measure adds language proposed by
Southern New England Telecommunications, which enhances
"subscribership and infrastructure deployment" within American
Indian communities by including a Lifeline credit of up to $30.25
per month and reducing Link Up service connection charges to
qualified applicants by $100.

The amendment follows an Oct. 5, 2000, FCC order to encourage
increased subscribership and infrastructure rollout in tribal
areas.  (Common Carrier docket 96-45)

MICHIGAN -- Customers can bring complaints without counsel

The Public Service Commission yesterday ruled that business and
residential telephone customers can bring "slamming" or
"cramming" complaints to the commission without the assistance of
an attorney.  The PSC's ruling involved a complaint filed by
Seaway Painting LLC against WorldCom, Inc., about a billing
dispute.

The PSC dismissed the complaint, as requested by the petitioner,
but concluded that Seaway may refile its complaint and proceed
"with the assistance of a person of its choice, who need not be a
licensed attorney."  The commission based its decision on a
provision of the Michigan Telecommunications Act, which provides,
"Hearings shall be conducted in a manner as to optimize
expediency, convenience, and the ability of end users to bring
and prosecute, without the assistance of counsel, complaints
alleging [slamming or cramming] while preserving the rights of
the parties."  (Case no. U-12863)

OREGON -- Group criticizes AT&T price hike

The Qwest Communications International, Inc.-backed Oregon
Coalition for Consumer Choice yesterday criticized AT&T Corp. for
its recent announcement of an 11% increase in consumer long
distance rates.  "This rate hike from AT&T just underscore the
importance of bringing real competition to the Oregon long
distance market," said Dan Lavey, coalition director.

The group said Qwest's entry into the Oregon interLATA (local
access and transport area) market would save a customer who made
only one 10-minute long distance call $2.80 per month, more than
$33 a year, over AT&T.

May 29th draft based on comments forwarded from several members.  Where 
possible, we have incorporated suggested changes and identified, with 
brackets ([ ]), alternative proposals or issues needing further discussion.  
Also attached is an alternative set of bullets drafted by Jeff Roark at 
Mirant suggesting an another way to organize the points.  Thank you all for 
your time and effort on this project.

Please review both documents in preparation for Friday's call, which will be 
held at 11:00 a.m. (EDT).  To access the conference call, dial 1-800-937-6563

Andy, I need to determine where our outreach for ACCF stands.  At present, 
Jeff Skilling is slated to attend an ACCF dinner on September 11.  They are 
obviously bugging me about the dinner arrangements AND our fund-raising 
outreach.  I probably need to cancel Jeff's appearance if we are not going to 
do their solicitation.  Thanks.

Rick:

This letter is disingenuous by not mentioning the retail price cap 
environment (economists know that price comes from consumer value flowing 
backward and not historic "cost" flowing forward in even quasi-competitive 
markets) and not mentioning FERC's action on the wholesale natural gas side.

If you want to explore a project where we get a bunch of in-state and 
out-of-state economists to sign an open letter arguing for lifting retail 
price caps with electricity from which we could make a case for wholesale J&R 
rates from demand dampening, I can contact either the Reason Public Policy 
Foundation or the Independence Institute in Oakland.  I mention the latter 
because they have experience in doing this sort of thing where they publish a 
signatory list in the newspapers and all that.  If so, I can look into this 
and try to get a price estimate.  If so, who on your team should I work with 
on this?

I think a letter from our side could make a good case for what the other side 
is calling "just and reasonable" by retail price freedom and open access, 
bilateral transaction institutional reform.

To Congress.  From what I can tell, at least half of these economists are on

Attached is a letter signed by 10 prominent energy economists expressing "deep
concern about the failure" of the FERC to address the problems in the 
wholesale
power markets.  It is expected that new Senate Energy Committee Chairman, 
Jeff Bingaman,
will exercise considerable Congressional Oversight Authority to pressure
FERC to act to remedy wholesale prices.

Late Friday evening, the two new FERC Commissioners were confirmed by the
full Senate.

Administration's Stance On Steel Imports Seen As Protectionist.  The Wall 
Street Journal (6/7, Phillips, Wonacott) reports, "For all his talk about 
free trade, President Bush's step toward blocking some steel imports signals 
that the Republicans will be every bit as protectionist as the Democrats, 
trade analysts said.  U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Zoellick, usually a classic 
free-trader, said Wednesday -- while in China preaching the benefits of 
opening markets -- that foreign steelmakers were selling their products below 
cost to gain market share in the U.S.  The administration, nonetheless, acted 
under a trade law that doesn't require it to prove such dumping took place.'  
At a time of economic slowdown in all our countries, there are going to be 
increasing pressures' for protectionism, Mr. Zoellick acknowledged.  In 
keeping with World Trade Organization rules, he said, 'the U.S. will act to 
safeguard and protect its own economic interests.'"  The Journal adds that 
"trade analysts and foreign steel producers said the decision proves that 
domestic politics always trumps free-market philosophy." 
 
       Steel State Senators Pleased By Bush Action.  The Charleston Daily 
Mail (6/7, Fischer) reports, "In pressing for an investigation that could 
result in restrictions in steel imports, President George Bush kept a 
campaign promise but could curiously counter his reputation as a free trader 
just as he prepares his first trip to Europe."  The Daily Mail adds, "A group 
of steel-state senators were pleased Tuesday afternoon, but quickly and 
soberly acknowledged that initiation of the trade case is only the 
beginning."  The senators included Jay Rockefeller, Arlen Specter, and Robert 
Byrd. 

       Gillespie, Weber Lobbying Seen As Key To US Steel Companies' Victory.  
The Washington Post (6/7, E1, Edsall, Blustein) Reports, "In persuading 
President Bush, a self-proclaimed free trader, to take steps this week aimed 
at restricting imports of steel, lobbyists for the U.S. steel industry used 
the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states would lose 
their health insurance if their companies closed.  The specter of an uprising 
by steel retirees, who substantially outnumber active steelworkers, provided 
a potent political argument for the industry's case that Bush should take 
drastic action to protect U.S. steel companies from a worldwide glut even at 
the cost of tarnishing his free-trade image.  The argument was advanced by 
two top Republican lobbyists, Edward W. Gillespie and Vin Weber, each of whom 
has been receiving $45,000 a month from an industry-union coalition called 
Stand Up for Steel.  The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when 
Bush announced that his administration will file a case with the U.S. 
International Trade Commission seeking to win authority to set quotas on 
steel imports.  And although many factors went into the White House's 
decision, industry sources and other participants pointed to the concerns 
raised by Gillespie and Weber as a classic demonstration of how a highly 
motivated constituency can sway an administration that barely won the 
electoral college and lost the popular vote."

Hertzberg/Edison Plan

A Fair Plan for California

Assembly Democratic Caucus

?

What the California public believes about the energy crisis:

?

Utilities are to blame.
Out-of-state generators have made huge profits.
We need to build more power plants to keep up with demand.
Deregulation is a failure.
The economy of the state is at risk.

?

What the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis:

?

Re-regulation (restore balance to system).
Very small, if any, rate increases.
Reliability of supply (no more blackouts).
No permanent damage to environment, more emphasis on renewable sources.
Penalties for those who gouged the state.
Guarantee this won=01,t happen again.

?

Themes of the Fair Plan:

?

Federal role:? The feds have refused to obey the law to maintain fair &=20
reasonable rates.
Restore fairness:? Solutions must protect residential and small business=20
users.
Re-regulation:? Reassert our authority over California=01,s energy destiny.
Stability & Reliability:? Increase supply and keep a lid on rates.

?

?

Goals of the Fair Plan:

?

Provide customers with reliable power and stable rates.
Restore regulated utilities to credit-worthiness to enable them to resume=

role of energy supplier.
Ensure that mega-users of electricity have direct access to independent=20
electricity providers to protect California=01,s economy.

?

?

Many elements of the proposed Edison MOU remain unchanged, except for:
Option to purchase the transmission system.
Re-regulates service for all residential and small business consumers.
Provides direct access to providers for mega-users above 500 kW.
Mega-users pay DRC to cover SCE debt.

?

Added elements to the MOU
Transmission option at book value.
Federal tax refund must be applied to debt.
SCE purchases net short only for residences and small businesses, if=20
necessary.
PUC retains jurisdiction over rates.
EIX provides assurance to keep SCE creditworthy.

George Strong's contract with Enron expires on June 30, 2001.  Do I need to 
draft a letter thanking him for his service to Enron?  Or, should someone 
else send a letter?  Is it better to merely allow the contract to expire?  
Please advise.  

Joe is planning to attend NCSL in San Antonio in August.  He indicated today 
that he wants to attend the Southern Legislative Conference in Georgia in 
July .  I am planning to attend both of these conferences.   What are your 
thoughts?  Is it proper for me to approve reasonable travel for him, or would 
you prefer to discuss in advance?

Should we organize some type of lunch or celebration for Joe's retirement or 
transition to consultant?  

Thanks, Jean

This is a very helpful memo.  I think you've hit the highlights of what we 
need to do.  We will take the lead on the five page presentation.  As for 
item #1, I agree.  Sarah will have a better idea on Tuesday what resources we 
need in DC.  As for the regional folks, I think we do want to balance time 
spent in DC with time spent on item #2.  Both are important.  Use of outside 
counsel will also need to be judged as we move forward.   As for #3, we are 
organizing the outreach here.  We clearly have much more to do on that 
front.  Janel is putting together a list of companies who might be interested 
in joining a NE RTO support coalition.  We will work with these groups to 
coordinate a message.  Two final thoughts.  1) We need to organize a similar 
effort for the Southeast, where I suspect state opposition will be even 
stronger, and 2) We need to coordinate closely on all documents used in these 
proceedings or with outside policy makers.  It is important that we have 
careful internal review.  Thanks for taking the lead on coordinating our game 
plan.

		 Subject: Northeast RTO Strategy

I wanted to bring try and coordinate our activities on the Northeast RTO.

1. FERC Mediation Process -- My recommendation is that Sarah Novosel is 
anointed Lead.  I don't know that we need to have every regional ISO person 
at all of the meetings.  I think that Sarah should consider her needs and 
make the call on other's participation.  Also, I would leave it up to Sarah 
to include or not include outside legal counsel.  This is going to be the 
focal point, but not the only place where this issue is discussed heavily.

2. State Political Support -- The key to any successful outcome is to have 
the key regulatory and political leaders in each state impacted by FERC's 
decision to support the formation of a single market and RTO.  Right now I 
don't think that we have pushed this agenda.  My recommendation is that NY, 
PA, NJ, and MA are the key places to focus (maybe NH and MD).  We need a 
strong and constant message in to the PUCs and Governor's offices that 
everyone wins under this Order.  Makes sense to me to have a small traveling 
band rove through these locations to build support.  Maybe need to beef up 
our lobbying presence in Harrisburg and Albany to get this done?

3. Congressional Political Support -- What is the current temperature of the 
Northeast delegation?  Have we messaged the "upside" of this action by FERC?  
What do Sen. Schumer and Sen. Clinton think?  Who else will take this on?  
One potential argument for the naysayers may be an environmental argument 
that this will result in more pollution in the Northeast, although FERC has 
dealt with this in the 888 context.  

My fear is that we are not providing enough air cover for Sarah at FERC.  
Getting Gov. Pataki and Gov. Ridge to state publicly that this is the "right" 
thing would be huge (even better to include Sen. Clinton).

Finally, can Sarah Novosel and the ISO team (Dan A, Howard, Tom H.)  build a 
short 5 page presentation that outlines the benefits of a single RTO that we 
can use on the road show and up on Capitol Hill?  They have the best 
knowledge to do this.

If people want a conference call, I'm in today and tomorrow.

Jim

Hi Jeff.  I hope you are enjoying the challenge of running Enron in the
midst of all the excitement and change in the energy industry.

I want to bring to your attention an issue that affects me quite directly in
my new role as CEO of TransElect, an independent electric transmission
company.  I think it also affects Enron in a very significant way.  The
National Grid has applied to the FERC for a declaratory order that would
permit the Grid to operate the Alliance RTO (this is a Midwest RTO that
includes AEP, Exelon, DTE, CMS, First Energy and Dominion).

I believe quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the
Grid is a significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in
the Northeast (New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small
step from this decision to one that would allow Southern to operate
GridSouth, or one that would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in
exchange for FP&L operating the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National
policy, transmission operators should be independent of either the wholesale
or retail electric markets.  As a business issue, many transmission owners
are reluctant to divest of transmission because they retain hope that their
transmission can be used to protect above market native generation.  How
would you like to try shipping power into the Northeast with the Grid, a
major retail supplier and a significant generator, controlling access to the
market?

I think it is important that the FERC give the Grid a "no" on the request
for permission.  It is even more important that the issue be decided by the
"new FERC".  There is a disturbing indication that the outgoing chairman
might okay this request on his way out the door.  I urge you to intervene as
a way to both slow down the freight train and as a way to get the right
answer out of FERC.  If you or your General Counsel would like more
information, give me a call at 503 636-7134, or call my General Counsel, Al
Statman, at 202 393-1200.

Thanks for considering the issue, and best wishes for continued success.

Fred Buckman

TRADE
Presidential Negotiating Authority A Must, Evans Says
Top administration officials suggested today they are stepping
up their push for presidential trade negotiating authority,
rejecting suggestions by Finance Chairman Baucus that the bill
may not move this year and showing flexibility on the
controversial Jordan free trade agreement, which is backed by
some key Democrats. Presidential trade negotiating authority is
"number one on my list of issues [that] I am focusing on right
now," Commerce Secretary Evans told a small group of reporters.
Evans said he was surprised that Baucus had reportedly said the
bill could "slip" into next year. Evans and a senior
administration official also in on the session insisted that the
bill must pass this year. They indicated not only was the trade
negotiating authority needed to help move negotiations along with
Chile and for a Free Trade Area of the Americas, but passage
would help bolster U.S. credibility as it tries to launch a new
trade round.
Evans pledged he would aggressively argue for free trade to
the American people and that President Bush would be touting it
as well. Evans also said the point of this week's announcement
that the United States would investigate limiting steel imports
under section 201 of U.S. trade law was to see whether the steel
industry needed help, but he noted that if the move made
Democrats more comfortable backing trade negotiating authority,
then all the better.
The senior official indicated the administration was
considering allowing the Jordan trade deal to maintain provisions
that could lead to enforcement of its labor and environmental
provisions with sanctions. The bill is supported by some
Democrats who want a tougher line on these issues. Some business
officials oppose the deal; others are not taking a position. "I
think we are all coming around to the conclusion that ... one
size does not fit all," the official said. "There's a lot of
debate about whether Jordan's going to provide a way forward. I
think it's a model. I don't think it is necessarily the model."
But he added, "I think there's a number of different ways to
approach the problem, and Jordan's one of them." And he compared
Jordan's provisions to a portion of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. - by Keith Koffler

TAXES
Gephardt Promises Offsets For Any Further Tax Cuts
House Minority Leader Gephardt pledged today that Democrats
will resist any move to pay for additional tax cuts this year
with Medicare and Social Security trust fund money, but echoed
Senate Majority Leader Daschle's comments Wednesday that there
would be offsets for any additional tax relief that might be on
the way this year. At a news conference criticizing the $1.35
trillion tax cut that became law today, Gephardt and other
Democratic leaders acknowledged that energy-related tax cuts and
renewal of a group of tax credits that expire this year are just
some of the items Congress may need to address.
Noting that GOP appropriators have already signaled they need
more money for FY02 appropriations bills, Gephardt said it will
be hard for Democrats and Republicans to advocate additional
spending or tax relief, but added: "We will have offsets. We hope
the Republicans will do the same." For now, he could offer no
specific ideas on what the offsets would be, but he left the door
open to even looking at the newly enacted tax bill as a source of
funds. Daschle also said it was likely that future Congresses may
need to modify the 10-year bill President Bush signed today in
order to keep the budget balanced, but played down the notion
such revisions could happen as early as this year. Ways and Means
ranking member Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said the real impact of
the tax cut is 10 years away, and claimed that [President]
"George W. is saying, 'Not on my watch.'"
The question of what tax measures could come next prompted a
letter from Rangel to Ways and Means Chairman Thomas. Sources
said Rangel learned this week that GOP leaders were considering
trying to move a patients' rights bill quickly - even if it meant
having the bill go right to the floor. There may have also been
discussions about similarly speedy treatment for an energy-
related tax break measure. But Rangel and Ways and Means Health
Subcommittee ranking member Fortney (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., wrote
Thomas today "to express our strong opposition to such an effort,
and hope that you will join us in defending the jurisdiction and
rights of the committee to act in this legislative arena.? you
know, the Health Subcommittee already has had one hearing this
year on this important topic." Meanwhile, GOP leaders are
apparently eyeing a number of other priorities. House Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma renewed his call for
expanding tax deductions for charitable contributions in his
statement greeting Bush's signature of the tax cut bill. Majority
Leader Armey has said more tax relief should be on the way, but
he acknowledged it could be modest. - by Stephen Norton

TAXES
Bush Signs $1.35 Trillion, 10-Year Tax Cut Measure
Surrounded in the ornate East Room by a crowd comprised mostly
of elite Republican lawmakers, President Bush today signed into
law the $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax relief package. The
legislation, which largely takes its cue from Bush's signature
campaign proposal, was hailed by Bush as a historic achievement
ranking with tax reduction bills signed by former Presidents
Kennedy and Reagan. Bush praised the role of some of the handful
of Democrats on hand - including Senate Finance Chairman Baucus
and Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Zell Miller of Georgia.
"Tax relief is the first achievement produced by the new tone in
Washington," Bush said. Calling this "an era of steady
cooperation," Bush predicted, "more achievements are ahead." But
few Democrats showed up to witness this particular moment of the
new era. Among them were Sens. Max Cleland of Georgia, Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey and Reps. Ralph Hall of Texas, Ken Lucas
of Kentucky and Bud Cramer of Alabama. Republican leaders such as
House Speaker Hastert, Senate Minority Leader Lott, House
Majority Leader Armey, Senate Minority Whip Nickles, House
Majority Whip DeLay, House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas and
Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, were more
typical of those attending the bill-signing ceremony.
Senior Senate Republicans declared afterward that one of their
top priorities this summer will be to make the tax cut, which
expires in a decade, permanent. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas vowed to
aggressively move the legislation as an amendment. "The first
thing we [have] got to do is make this [tax cut] permanent,"
Gramm told CongressDaily. "I intend to offer it at least a dozen
times." Nickles said Republicans will "be successful in either
extending the rate reduction or extending the zero bracket for
estate taxes, I think," but he acknowledged, "It's going to be a
challenge." Nickles added that he still will try to reduce the
capital gains tax from 20 percent to 15 percent, to provide tax
breaks for unemployed and those lacking employer assistance to
buy health insurance, and add tax cuts to the minimum wage bill.
Other tax cut vehicles, he said, could be the "Patients' Bill of
Rights" and the tax extenders bill. On managed care reform,
Nickles said, "there are some discussions going on, but I
wouldn't try to claim any optimism" about a deal. - by Keith
Koffler

HEALTH
Senate Readies For Debate On Patients' Rights Proposal
With the Senate still mired in debate over the education bill,
behind-the-scenes discussions are picking up on what is expected
to be the chamber's next order of business - debate on a managed
care "Patients' Bill of Rights." HHS Secretary Thompson was on
Capitol Hill today to meet separately with Senate Democratic and
GOP leaders to discuss a potential compromise on an issue whose
differences have thus far proved unbridgeable. President Bush
earlier this spring vowed to veto the bill Democrats intend to
bring to the floor - sponsored by Senate Commerce ranking member
John McCain, R-Ariz., Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., and Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy. And Bush has
endorsed a competing bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,
John Breaux, D-La., and James Jeffords, I-Vt. At the same time,
Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who helped write the McCain-Edwards-
Kennedy bill - but deferred sponsorship while he sought to
negotiate with the White House - is continuing his efforts, but
signaled he will not wait much longer. After one of his meetings
today, Thompson tried to strike a conciliatory tone. "We hope
we're able to reach an agreement," he said, but added that "if
the president feels strongly and this bill doesn't reach his
principles, he will" veto it.
Meanwhile, backers of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords approach said
new estimates from CBO show that their bill should represent the
final compromise. According to CBO, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords
bill would, when fully phased in, raise health insurance premiums
by an estimated 2.9 percent. That compares to 4.2 percent for the
McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, and 2 percent for the GOP-sponsored
bill that passed the Senate in 1999. "Today's CBO report
illustrates what we've said all along, that our bill presents a
true compromise on the 'Patients' Bill of Rights,'" said Frist.
But the veto question appears the key to the upcoming debate.
Backers of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure insist that the
president will sign virtually any patients' rights bill Congress
manages to pass. That prospect has frightened business and
insurance lobbyists, who vehemently oppose provisions that would
allow broad new rights to sue health plans in state and federal
court. Administration officials Wednesday denied widespread
speculation that Bush would soon issue a formal statement again
threatening to veto the bill, but also left what one source
called "wiggle room" if the Senate makes some, as yet undecided-
upon, changes.
While opponents of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy measure fear
they lack the votes to defeat or even substantially change the
measure - it appears to have virtually unanimous support among
Democrats - save Breaux - as well as at least a handful of
Republicans, including Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania - opponents are more confident
about their ability to add to the measure a package of tax-
related health insurance "access" provisions. Some of those,
including a broad expansion of Medical Savings Accounts, could be
controversial. - by Julie Rovner and April Fulton

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Craig Predicts Senate Organizational Deal By Next Week
Senate Republican and Democratic leaders are nearing agreement
on a new organizational resolution for the Senate, although key
senators predicted the issue would not be resolved until next
week. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he hoped negotiators would
be able to complete an agreement today. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-
N.M., said Republicans were "purifying" their own proposals to
decide how many points to include. Gramm and Domenici are part of
a five-member GOP task force assigned by Minority Leader Lott to
negotiate a new resolution with Majority Leader Daschle. Daschle
said today negotiations were "going well," but declined to give
details. The group is expected to meet again with Daschle today.
But before any deal is final, Republicans will run any
agreement that is reached by the entire GOP Conference - a
requirement that led Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry
Craig of Idaho to predict a deal would not be finalized until
mid-week. Republicans have backed down on their requirement that
any new resolution include a mechanism to move presidential
nominations to the floor. Instead, said a GOP aide, negotiators
will assemble a memorandum or some sort of written statement, or
a colloquy for leaders to deliver on the floor. Democrats,
meanwhile, have given in to a GOP demand that committees be
expanded to reflect a one-seat Democratic advantage, rather than
bumping Republicans from panels. Said Commerce Chairman Hollings,
"I'm not comfortable with it, but that's what it's going to be."
Hollings' panel will grow to 23 members, a size he said will make
it hard to hold efficient hearings. "You get through opening
statements and, good God, the day is over," he said. - by Geoff

GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS
Lieberman To Probe Decisions On Energy, Environment
Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Lieberman today promised
not to use his new chairmanship to "practice the politics of
personal attacks and destruction," but said he will investigate
the high cost of energy, as well as ask the Bush administration
to explain its rescission of federal environmental standards.
"The current high price of energy and shortages in energy supply
in some parts of our country . will be the committee's immediate
priority," Lieberman said in an agenda session with reporters.
Lieberman has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday to look at the
deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries and a
June 20 hearing to consider whether the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission has done enough to keep electricity prices reasonable.
"From all that I have seen . I think FERC has the authority to
act and should have acted already," Lieberman said. A cosponsor
of price cap legislation proposed by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-
Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., Lieberman said he would not
ordinarily favor price controls, but said the lack of competition
in the Western energy market warrants them.
Lieberman said he also wanted to know how Bush administration
officials decided so quickly to roll back federal standards
regulating arsenic, forest roadbuilding and mining waste. "Who
did you talk to?" Lieberman asked rhetorically of the
administration's rapid rollback of federal policy long in the
making. He also said he would "put the breaks on any additional
plans the White House has to roll back environmental standards."
Lieberman said he had a good relationship with ranking member
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and said they would work together on
issues such as reducing government waste and abuse, electronic
government initiatives and attracting new and qualified federal
personnel.
As the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last year's
disputed election, Lieberman was asked to clarify his vow not to
use his committee for political retribution. "The difference
between oversight and overkill is in the eye of the beholder, but
you and I will know it once we see it," he said. When asked
specifically about whether he would investigate Vice President
Cheney's use of his official residence at the U.S. Naval
Observatory for a political event, Lieberman said definitively
no, but compared it to former President Clinton's White House
coffees. "It did make me laugh because the event and the
explanation of the event sounded very similar to what Republicans
said" about the coffees, Lieberman said. - by Mark Wegner

ENVIRONMENT
Interior Approps Panel Restores Bush Energy, Land Cuts
The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee unanimously
approved an $18.9 billion spending bill today that restores
President Bush's proposed cuts in energy research and increases
funding for energy conservation and land preservation
initiatives, National Journal News Service reported. The measure
provides $1.8 billion for energy programs, an increase of $294
million over the administration's request. The panel included
$311 million for weatherization and state energy grants, which is
an increase of $120 million over last year's level, and includes
$940 million for overall energy conservation. Calling the
restoration of energy conservation and research funding
"crucial," given the nation's electricity woes, subcommittee
ranking member Norman Dicks, D-Wash., hailed the panel's "very
bipartisan effort" and dedication to conservation spending. "This
is a good example of how we can cooperate and work on a
bipartisan basis," he said.
In addition to the increased energy funding, the subcommittee
also agreed to provide $1.32 billion for the widely heralded land
conservation initiative launched last year as a compromise to the
controversial Conservation and Reinvestment Act. Although
significantly smaller than CARA, the conservation initiative
nonetheless represents a doubling of federal spending on a
variety of resource conservation programs. The bill increases
funding by $121 million over last year's level and $64 million
over the administration's request. The program includes $100
million for state wildlife grants, $45 million for wetlands
conservation, $47 million for historic preservation and $60
million in conservation incentives for private landowners.
House Appropriations ranking member David Obey, D-Wis., said
the increase in conservation funding keeps a commitment the
Congress made to the compromise program last year when
appropriators balked at CARA's 15-year budget commitment to land
programs. "That should send a message to the administration that
they ought to recognize a good deal when they see it," Obey said.
Appropriations Chairman Young said he expected the full committee
to mark up the Interior spending bill next Wednesday. - by Cyril

EDUCATION
GOP Criticizes Plan To Restrict 'Straight A's' Initiative
Republicans today said an amendment to the reauthorization of
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act exempting one category
of school funding from a trial program known as "Straight A's"
would gut a major component of the president's education bill.
The amendment to exempt 21st Century learning centers from the
"Straight A's" pilot program would remove almost half of the
available money and would discourage states from participating,
Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said. If the amendment passes, it would
"certainly be a blow to the bipartisan coalition that has worked
on this bill," said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. The "Straight
A's" program was taken out of the bill on the House side, so
Frist said it was essential the provision stay in the Senate bill
when the bills go to conference. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
who is sponsoring the amendment, said he still plans to move
forward on it.
Meanwhile, the Senate set aside another Dodd amendment today
after Republicans threatened a filibuster, delaying a potentially
explosive vote which Republicans said goes to the heart of
whether Congress wants federal or local control over schools. The
amendment would require states to "achieve comparability of
education opportunities" among their schools, and was watered
down from earlier, more specific language. "This is not radical,
this is common sense," Dodd said during floor debate. Senate
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said the
amendment does not interfere with the president's initiative and
encourages states to provide "additional focus and attention on
poor and underprivileged children." But Collins said it was an
"attempt by the federal government to set national standards." -

Jackson Meets With Lawmakers To Discuss Electoral Reform, Other
Issues
Rev. Jesse Jackson was on Capitol Hill today meeting with
Senate Majority Leader Daschle, and Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-
Conn., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., to discuss electoral reform
and other issues, including judicial nominations. "I'm sure
hearings on electoral reform will begin this summer," Jackson
said, citing a report to be formally released by the Civil Rights
Commission Friday showing that minority voters in Florida were
overwhelmingly "disenfranchised." A draft of that proposed report
leaked out earlier this week, prompting criticism from
Republicans that it was inspired by partisanship. The commission
consists of four Democrats, three independents and one
Republican. Jackson said, "We must even the playing field for
certain voters." Jackson also said he was taking another trip to
South Africa to deal with the spread of AIDS in that country.

Daschle PAC To Hold Annual Gala
DASHPAC, the leadership PAC of newly minted Senate Majority
Leader Daschle, could not have picked a better time - fundraising
wise - to schedule its annual Washington bash than this evening.
Sources said the DASHPAC gala, which is being held at the 701
restaurant, is expected to pull in over $1 million and possibly
break the PAC's previous record. Tickets to tonight's gala are
going for $1,000 per individual, $5,000 per PAC or $10,000 for
corporate donors: the PAC has a $10,000 limit for contributors.
On K Street, lots of heavy lifting has been done by several blue

Poll Finds Smith, Shaheen Tied
A new American Research Group poll shows Sen. Bob Smith, R-
N.H., in a statistical tie with Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen,
but it also shows GOP Rep. John Sununu leading Shaheen by double
digits in a trial heat of the 2002 election. The poll, conducted
last Friday through Monday of 558 registered voters with a 4.26
point error margin, shows Smith leading Shaheen 42-41 percent,
with 17 percent undecided. But Sununu leads Shaheen 51-35
percent, with 14 percent undecided. Sununu has been contemplating
a challenge to Smith, who briefly left the Republican Party in
1999 during his unsuccessful presidential campaign, and the
Manchester Union-Leader reported today that many state
Republicans believe that Sununu has passed the point of no return
and will indeed challenge Smith in the GOP primary. However, a
recent invitation Sununu sent out for a June 10 fundraiser
headlined by former President Bush talks about a House re-
election campaign. In the letter, which refers to his 2000
Democratic challenger Martha Fuller Clark, Sununu wrote: "We had
a hard fought campaign last year. ... in less than six months
time, my opponent spent over $1 million ... already, she has
announced her candidacy for 2002. Our campaign next year will be
at least as tough, if not tougher." Sununu can transfer the money
to a Senate campaign if he decides to enter that race.

TRANSPORTATION
Airlines Offer More Voluntary Commitments To Improve Customer
Services
In an apparent effort to stave off potentially onerous
passengers' rights legislation, the airlines announced today they
are beefing up their voluntary commitments to improve customer
services and also are making those commitments legally
enforceable by including them in their customer contracts. House
Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young and
Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman
John Mica, R-Fla., applauded the industry's latest commitment,
saying airlines should not bear sole blame for air travel delays.
Citing weather difficulties as the leading cause of delay, Young
and Mica also singled out local opposition to runway construction
as a factor in air congestion and delay. Fairly narrow
passengers' rights legislation pending in the Senate would
strengthen the government's hand in holding the airline industry
to better standards and was expected to come to the floor for a
vote in that chamber. Among the airlines' latest commitments, are
pledges to offer the lowest fare available on the telephone
reservation system, to notify passengers of known delays,
cancellations and diversions and to meet passengers "essential
needs" during long on-aircraft delays.

AGRICULTURE
Veneman Defends Her Undersecretary Choice
Agriculture Secretary Veneman defended a nominee for a top
position at her department against allegations he was insensitive
to minorities and favored corporate farm interests, the
Associated Press reported. Veneman, speaking to reporters after a
ceremony honoring former Agriculture Secretary Glickman, called
Thomas Dorr, an Iowa farmer picked to be undersecretary for rural
development, a "visionary thinker." Dorr's nomination has been
criticized by groups representing minority farmers and small-
scale farming interests. At Iowa State University in 1999, Dorr
observed that an economically prosperous area of his state lacked
ethnic and religious diversity. He also has suggested the
creation of giant farming operations in which individual farmers
would work together. The Senate Agriculture Committee has not
scheduled a hearing on Dorr's nomination. Senate Agriculture
Chairman Harkin has not taken a position on Dorr. In a recent
letter to the committee, members of the Congressional Black
Caucus said they were shocked that a USDA nominee "would express
the belief that ethnic diversity is an impediment to economic
growth."

HEALTH
Senate Transition Could Rekindle Generic Drug Reform Effort
   While drug patent reform legislation has been on the shelf for
the past few years, the changing political dynamics in the
Senate--coupled with the drive to find a way to reduce drug
costs--may soon mean a renewed effort on the issue. The House
Energy and Commerce Committee is considering changes to the 1984
drug patent law as part of the broader Medicare prescription drug
bill it is drafting, several key sources said.
   The idea would be to save the government money by removing
some barriers faced by generic copies of brand-name drugs when
they are ready to go to market, sources said.
   But any changes to the Hatch-Waxman law--named for its
sponsors, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-
Calif.--could open up a multitude of other drug patent issues
that have bogged down reform for years.
   "That type of dynamic might make you have to choose between
one [bill] or the other," said a prescription drug industry
source. The brand-name drug industry so far has  been reluctant
to back efforts to change the Hatch-Waxman law. But the generic-
drug industry said it would welcome the change.
   "If Congress is going to take full advantage of the savings
that generic drugs offer as it examines potential ways to bring
drug costs down to pay for a Medicare drug benefit, it makes
great sense" to enact a generic drug bill, said a lobbyist for
the generic drug industry.
   Recent bills to speed generic drugs to market introduced by
Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and John McCain, R-Ariz., and by
Reps. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, could
save as much as $70 billion, sponsors estimate. CBO has yet to
score them.
   But the actual savings of such a bill are hard to estimate,
particularly when balanced against the research cuts drug
companies say they could be forced to make.
   The research-based pharmaceutical industry estimates that it
will spend about $30.5 billion on research and development this
year, compared with $2 billion in 1980. The industry says it
develops about 45 percent of the world's drugs in the United
States.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee is planning a hearing next
Wednesday on generic drugs, nonprescription drugs, and other
issues. But a spokesman warned observers not to read too much
into the scheduling of the hearing.
   "In noticing the hearing, no one should try to read between
the lines," the spokesman said. "Right now, we're looking at a
wide range of options. In the end, our goal is to address the
issue of escalating prices without harming research and
innovation."
   Hatch-Waxman reform also may get a boost from the switch to
Democratic control in the Senate.
   While aides said no official discussions have taken place on
moving a generic-drug bill since this week's Democratic takeover,
members of at least three panels--the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee, the Commerce Committee and the
Judiciary Committee--have expressed interest.
   And Hatch issued a warning before stepping down as chairman.
   "To those who would propose to change the 1984 legislation, I
would urge you to consider that this is a carefully balanced bill
and caution against making changes that tilt the balance," Hatch
told a May 25 hearing. "Yet, no law is so perfect that it cannot
stand improvement as it gets tested by the realities of a
changing marketplace and society."
   Newly installed Judiciary Chairman Leahy introduced a bill
earlier this year that would require generic-drug companies that
enter deals with brand-name companies to keep their products off
the market to submit the terms of the deal to the FTC and the
Justice Department.
   Leahy will hold oversight hearings on the issue this year, a
spokesman said. -- By April Fulton

ENERGY
Armey, Watts Differ Over Energy Strategy
   After weeks of sustained Democratic attacks on Republican
energy policy, House Majority Leader Armey and Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma--both of whom
represent oil-rich states--clashed publicly this week on what
action Congress should take to address the rising costs and
diminishing supplies of the nation's energy.
   Responsible for House communications strategy, Watts called on
House Resources Chairman Hansen and Energy and Commerce Chairman
Tauzin Monday to schedule hearings on the "volatile prices"
facing energy consumers this year.
   "We need to get answers from energy company executives
including producers, suppliers, refiners, transporters,
distributors and retailers, with the goals of finding solutions
to these price fluctuations and bringing price stability to the
public," Watts wrote in letters to the chairmen.
   Responding to a reporter's question Tuesday, Armey said he
opposed committee hearings to look at allegations of "price
gouging" by the energy industry.
   "I would not personally see the need," Armey said. "Why would
one hold hearings on what I characterize as cheap political
demagoguery? And that is what it is."
   Armey added: "If people want to look at the companies, point
their fingers at them, that's just nonsense. I don't care who it
comes from. It is just nonsense."
   Without specifically recommending hearings, Watts again urged
Republican members Wednesday "to provide the American people with
answers about the current energy crunch," saying he favored the
measures proposed under President Bush's energy plan.
   "While Democrats overstate the role government should play in
energy policy, Republicans cannot forget that it does have a
role," Watts wrote in his latest memo. "While price caps are not
an option, we must insist on price accountability."
   The Watts memo, based on New Models polling data produced by
Republican pollster David Winston, reflects GOP concerns about
the Democratic energy assault.
   Republicans also are frustrated by the attention given to the
party switch of Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., instead of the
Republican $1.35 trillion tax cut.
   "It complicates efforts to talk about tax relief and education
when the political media coverage overwhelmingly focused on
Jeffords," a Watts aide said.
   To keep the GOP tax relief message alive, Watts suggested in
his Wednesday memo that members tout the rebate checks the
Treasury Department will begin mailing to taxpayers this summer.
   "From public service announcements to franked mailings, the
possibilities are endless, and Conference is developing a number
of resources for you to use," Watts wrote.
   In his memo, Watts also urged members to "redouble" their
efforts to talk about the passage of education reform. "There is
no reason for us to stop talking to the public about education
just because the vote was gaveled," he wrote.
   An Armey spokesman said Wednesday there was no rift between
Armey and Watts. "It's just a question of exploring options," the
spokesman said. -- By Mark Wegner

APPROPRIATIONS
Ag Approps Panel Sticks To Caps, Kills School Lunch Program
   In the first test of FY02 appropriations spending limits,
House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Republicans
defeated a $300 million proposal Wednesday to continue the
international school lunch food-aid program.
   After strong pleas from House Appropriations Chairman Young
and Subcommittee Chairman Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, not to break
the caps, the subcommittee voted 8-7 against the amendment
sponsored by subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, to
the FY02 Agriculture appropriations bill.
   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., voted with the Democrats in favor
of the proposal.
   Voting against the amendment clearly made Republican
subcommittee members nervous. Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., quickly
proposed report language that the subcommittee "strongly urges"
the Agriculture Department to continue the program, formally
known as the Global Food for Education Initiative.
   Former Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D., now U.S. ambassador to
the world food agencies in Rome, and former Senate Majority
Leader Dole have promoted it.
   Kaptur asked Walsh to change the "strongly urges" wording to
"expects," and the report language passed unanimously. However,
after the markup session, Kaptur said that she does not know what
impact the report language will have.  She is "inclined" to re-
offer the amendment in full committee.
   Bonilla initially suggested the report language, but House
Appropriations ranking member David Obey, D-Wis., pressed for the
vote, saying that if the subcommittee "can't get together on food
aid to kids who need it," he did not know what measures it could
agree on.
   The Clinton administration started the international school
lunch initiative, using its administrative authority to
distribute surplus commodities. It did not have to be scored in
FY01, subcommittee staff director Hank Moore explained.
   Both Obey and Kaptur said they are concerned that the Bush
administration has not stated a clear position on the school
lunch initiative yet.  They believe a directive from the
subcommittee would encourage USDA officials to make a commitment
for next year.
   The subcommittee later approved the bill, which provides $74.2
billion for all programs, of which $15.5 billion is discretionary
funding. The rest is for mandatory farm and nutrition programs.
   Excluding $3.6 billion in emergency appropriations in the FY01
bill, it contains a 7 percent increase. Kaptur, who has had testy
relations with Bonilla, said the bill was "better than we
expected." -- By Jerry Hagstrom

Dem Appropriators Criticize Administration's NSF Funding Request
   A Senate appropriations panel Wednesday criticized the
administration's request for funding for the National Science
Foundation, saying it was inadequate to fully support the
agency's research efforts and failed to move toward the panel's
goal of doubling NSF funding over five years, National Journal's
Technology Daily reported.
   "I am disappointed in the administration's overall research
and development budget, and the NSF proposal in particular," said
Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md. "This is the first time in the NSF's 50-year
history that an administration has requested Congress to cut
NSF's research budget below the previous year's level."
   The administration requested $4.47 billion for NSF in FY02, a
$56 million increase, or 1.3 percent, which is less than the rate
of inflation. NSF's budget would have to rise by about $600
million in FY02 to meet the goal of doubling in five years,
Mikulski said. She asked NSF Director Rita Colwell, "Is this [$56
million increase] what you wanted, or is this what you got?"
   Colwell defended the budget request, saying it focuses on
areas the administration has identified as priorities, such as
education and training. But she also added that she fully
supports the panel's efforts to double NSF's budget.
   The NSF proposal calls for an 11 percent increase for
education and human resources, including $200 million for math
and science partnerships and $26.2 million for a program that
puts graduate students in K-12 classrooms. The proposal also
would increase stipends for graduate fellowships.
   "We are losing our best and brightest science students to
other fields," said Eamon Kelly, chairman of the National Science
Board, who expressed support for the budget proposal. "Even our
future workers who are not directly engaged in scientific
endeavors will need to be scientifically literate to perform
their tasks."
   Mikulski agreed with the panelists about the importance of
science and math education and worker literacy.
   But she also noted the value of funding basic research in
science and technology, saying that if NSF had not done the work
it began 50 years ago, "I don't believe we'd have the information
technology we have today."
   Colwell noted that the budget request would increase NSF's
support for nanoscale science and engineering research by 16.1
percent. "Nanotechnology ... could change the way almost
everything is designed, from medicines to computers to
automobiles."
   The budget request would increase funding for research and
related areas by 0.5 percent, to $3.33 billion. Members of the
House Science Research Subcommittee Wednesday afternoon
characterized that funding level as inadequate.
   "About the kindest thing I can say about this budget request
is that it's disappointing," said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-
Texas.
   Testifying at the House hearing, NSF Deputy Director Joseph
Bordogna said the budget's focus on "people" was intentional.
   "NSF is as much about building a world-class workforce as it
is about discovery," he said. "It is important to emphasize that
research and education are pursued in an integrated way and that
synergy between the programs in each of these accounts is
fundamental to NSF's mission." -- By Robert Lamb

Despite Shrunken Surplus, GOP Sees Increased FY02 Cushion
   Despite CBO's reduced estimate of next year's surplus,
Republican budget writers said they still plan on an FY02 budget
cushion of about $27.5 billion--even after setting aside the
politically untouchable Medicare trust-fund surplus.
   GOP budget experts expect the cushion to come from smaller-
than-allowed costs of the FY02 share of the $1.35 trillion tax
cut. The experts explained their estimates of the figures in
response to a recent CongressDaily article indicating that the
FY02 cushion may have sagged to as low as $1 billion, based on
CBO's revised surplus estimates.
   Democrats, meanwhile, countered that the tax cut, which
President Bush plans to sign today, relies on an accounting
gimmick in FY02 to make additional money available. In FY03 and
beyond, this could cause Congress to tap the Medicare trust-fund
surplus--despite language in the budget resolution that bars
Congress from doing so.
   In an analysis that House Budget ranking member John Spratt,
D-S.C., planned to release today, Democrats charge that the $1.35
trillion tax cut "exhausts the available surplus in 2003 through
2006 and jeopardizes the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare," even assuming Congress adheres to the spending limits
in the budget resolution.
   The FY02 budget resolution approved by Congress used CBO's
January baseline to project a total FY02 budget surplus of $218.6
billion, with an on-budget surplus of $47.7 billion, of which
$35.9 billion comes from the Medicare Part A trust-fund surplus.
   The remaining $11.8 billion of the surplus was left as a
reserve to cover expenses not already built into the budget,
including the increase in defense spending expected to result
from Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's strategic review.
   Last week, CBO released its analysis of the president's
budget, using a revised baseline that reduced its estimate of the
surplus by $9 billion. In April, CBO recalculated the FY02
Medicare trust fund at $37.6 billion--or $1.7 billion larger than
estimated in January.
   Taken together, CBO's most recent estimates of the total
surplus and Medicare surplus component would reduce the size of
the FY02 reserve by $10.7 billion, leaving only $1.1 billion in
the reserve.
   The budget resolution allowed for taxes to be cut by $65.3
billion in FY02. But the final tax package that Congress enacted,
as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation, carries an FY02
price tag of just $37.8 billion--meaning that $27.5 billion
budgeted for, but not "spent," in the tax bill should be included
in the available FY02 surplus.
   CBO's January baseline produced a reserve of nearly $12
billion for FY02, assuming the tax bill would use up the entire
$65.3 billion provided in the budget. Because the tax bill
actually cost $27.5 billion less, the reserve instead would
amount to about $39 billion, using the January surplus estimates.
   Using the less generous May baseline and the more-than-$1
billion reserve it produces, the unspent portion of the tax bill
would take the FY02 reserve to almost $29 billion.
   In both cases, the reserve represents the size of the surplus
after the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds are set
aside.
   In the analysis being issued today, Democrats say the size of
the tax cut "means that funding priorities like defense
modernization, a Medicare prescription drug benefit or
education--priorities that even Republicans support--will require
a choice between two equally undesirable outcomes: Either the
resources must come from funds already dedicated to Social
Security and Medicare, or funding of other national priorities
must be severely cut--simply because the tax cut is too big."
   The Democratic analysis uses CBO's May baseline and includes
the discretionary spending levels and policies assumed in the
budget resolution, adjusted to reflect the actual cost of the
enacted tax bill as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   It projects an available surplus, outside the Social Security
and Medicare trust funds, of $24 billion in FY02 (a figure that
accounts for $5 billion in debt service costs)--but a deficit of
$5 billion in FY03 and a $2 billion deficit in FY04.
   As for the FY02 surplus, Democrats counter that Republicans
were only able to show a surplus by using a $33 billion
accounting maneuver that merely moved money from FY01 to FY02.
   As part of the effort to keep the tax bill in compliance with
the budget resolution, a provision delays the deadline for
corporate estimated-tax payments from September 15 to October 1,
2001--effectively making the $33 billion in estimated revenue
available on the first day of FY02, instead of at the end of
FY01. -- By Lisa Caruso

TRADE
Anti-NAFTA Coalition Plans To Fight Chilean Trade Pact Effort
   Among the trade battles the Bush administration could be
facing this year is the establishment of a free-trade agreement
with Chile. A group of labor and environmental organizations
known as the Chilean Fair Trade Coalition will announce plans
today to step up lobbying against the deal.
   The coalition includes the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters and Friends of the Earth, along with a number of labor
groups from Chile.
   The Bush administration would like to see an agreement with
Chile worked out by the end of the year. It is expected that such
an agreement would be based largely on the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which many labor, environmental and human rights
groups charge has adversely affected U.S. jobs and environmental
standards in the business corridor along the U.S.-Mexican border.
   Among members who have championed the cause of expanded trade
with Chile are Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. and Phil Gramm, R-
Texas. Both have offered legislation to bring Chile into NAFTA.
   Once the administration presents Congress with a proposed
trade deal, sources said the debate would be reminiscent of the
bitter NAFTA controversy.
   While significant differences remain between the United States
and Chile over the details of the deal, the administration has
stressed the importance of moving toward the establishment of a
Free Trade Area of Americas, and the Chilean pact would help
advance that effort.
   In addition, such a pact would help Chile play a higher-
profile role in South American political and economic affairs
than its rival, Brazil.
   To help bring about the FTAA, many observers believe it is
essential for the president to have broad presidential trade-
negotiating authority. Formerly known as fast track, the proposal
is moving up on the congressional agenda.
   House Majority Leader Armey said this week he would like to
see a measure on the floor as soon as July, and Senate Finance
Chairman Baucus also has noted the importance of presidential
trade-negotiating authority. But Baucus has insisted that labor
and environmental matters be taken into account.
   This week, the Business Roundtable sent a policy paper to
Congress members.  It outlines a spate of bilateral trade
agreements in recent years--often without U.S. participation and
at the expense of the United States.
   To shore up the U.S. role in trade matters, the Business
Roundtable recommends renewal of what the Bush administration
calls "trade promotion authority" as quickly as possible. -- By

TECHNOLOGY
High-Tech Companies Planning To Add Voice To Privacy Debate
   With the Democratic takeover of the Senate stirring
speculation that federal privacy legislation will take on a
higher priority in the chamber, members of the Silicon Valley
lobbying group TechNet are moving to become more engaged in the
issue, National Journal's Technology Daily reported.
   In a conference call earlier this week, lobbyists for high-
tech companies including Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Sun
Microsystems and Accenture decided to try to craft some privacy
principles, without advocating or opposing any particular
legislation. The list then could be used to educate senators on
how to view any particular privacy bill. "Companies are still
trying to decide whether they should get behind a piece of
legislation or not," said one person familiar with the TechNet
call.
   The ascension of new Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings, who
sponsored a tough privacy bill in the 106th Congress, fueled
speculation among several privacy advocates and business groups
that the chances for action on privacy legislation have improved.
   Expectations for action in 2001 had dimmed over the past six
months, as the complexity of privacy legislation became apparent
and Republican leaders showed little appetite for moving a bill.
   But several high-tech lobbyists said Hollings has expressed
personal interest in protecting consumers' privacy and could
become more aggressive on the issue.
   Other observers said Hollings is likely to have higher
priorities, such as transportation and television violence.
   A spokesman for Hollings has said the senator is still mulling
his priorities. Neither Hollings nor new Commerce ranking member
John McCain, R-Ariz., have re-introduced the privacy bills they
sponsored in the 106th Congress.
   TechNet Executive Vice President Connie Correll said the
organization's members are working on opening a dialogue with
Hollings to discuss privacy and other tech issues the committee
is expected to consider. She also said TechNet had been planning
to develop privacy principles.
   Correll declined to comment on which TechNet members would be
developing the group's privacy principles. She also would not
comment on what direction the group might pursue.
   The tech industry has been divided on what policy stance to
take on privacy, with some companies and associations taking a
stronger stance on the need for a basic privacy bill and others
advocating a free-market approach to determining a solution to
privacy protection.
   Meanwhile, the makeup of the Commerce Committee remains
uncertain while Republican and Democratic leaders negotiate an
agreement on committee assignments.
   Hollings is officially the chairman, but any freshman members,
such as Sen. George Allen, R-Va., currently have no seats on
Senate committees because committee membership temporarily is
based on the organizational structure adopted for the 106th
Congress. -- By Bara Vaida

AGRICULTURE
Agricultural Conservation Groups Call For New Farm Programs
   Representatives of agricultural conservation, wildlife and
industry groups presented conflicting proposals on the
conservation title of the next farm bill Wednesday, when they
testified before the House Agriculture Conservation, Credit,
Rural Development and Research Subcommittee.
   Craig Cox, executive vice president of the Soil and Water
Conservation Society, called for doubling the Agriculture
Department budget for existing conservation programs and starting
a new $3 billion "stewardship-based farm and ranch program" to
pay farmers for continuing or starting to use good conservation
practices.
   If the current Freedom to Farm program is continued, Cox said,
farmers should have the option of signing land stewardship
contracts rather than continuing with the Freedom to Farm
program.
   Cox said the new spending should be focused on land kept in
production rather than idled in the Conservation Reserve Program.
The increased spending would require a "dramatically expanded"
Natural Resources and Conservation Service staff to provide
technical services, he said.
   A larger administrative staff also would be needed to analyze
the stewardship "contracts" farmers would have to take out with
the government to get the money, Cox said.
   Cox said the society's proposal, based on two years of
interviews and focus groups with a variety of people in
agriculture, would be available to farmers throughout the
country, unlike the current commodity programs, which concentrate
assistance in the Plains and the South.
   The proposal envisions large-scale assistance to ranchers with
grazing land and to growers of specialty crops.
   Asked his views on limits to conservation payments, Cox said
he believes the money should go those who deliver "environmental
goods and services" to the taxpayer.
   The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture
testified in favor of block grants to state governments to
develop assistance to farmers appropriate to each state. Wildlife
groups asked for an expansion of the land-idling Conservation
Reserve Program to 45 million acres.
   But the National Grain and Feed Association, which represents
agricultural suppliers, said the CRP should not be expanded
beyond the current 36.4 million acres.
   After the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla.,
said in a statement that the conservation proposals would be
costly.
   "The interesting fact is that if we add up what the majority
of groups asked for in the commodity title, plus what most groups
have asked for or are going to ask for in a conservation title,
we will have already spent more money than was budgeted for the
entire farm bill," Lucas said. "That is why I want to focus on
what is working and what is not working; what is being done
efficiently and effectively and what is not." -- By Jerry

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Dorgan: Democrats Will Rule Senate With A `Different Tone'
   Democrats will seek to promote a "different tone and a
different style" as the majority party, although the new
political realities will force changes in the legislative agenda
and relationships that shape the Capitol, according to Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D.
   "The Bush agenda is an agenda that is not really central to
what we have to do in the next few weeks," Dorgan, who co-chairs
the Democratic Policy Committee, said Wednesday during a wide-
ranging interview with CongressDaily.
   Dorgan said after acting on managed care legislation, the
Senate would quickly have to begin to focus on moving the FY02
appropriations bills.
   On energy issues, a top Bush administration priority, Dorgan
said the president's plan "is not a balanced plan." He said the
Congress would have to grapple with energy issues in a way that
is "much more significant than any of us thought."
   Dorgan, who met with newly installed Energy and Natural
Resources Chairman Bingaman Wednesday, said Democratic
legislation would focus on production, conservation, renewable
energy, and efficiency of appliances. Emphasizing an area of
agreement with the White House, he said there were opportunities
to join on incentives to encourage production.
   "My hope is we don't debate the production issue over ANWR,"
he said in a reference to oil drilling in the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge.
   He said Democrats were interested in using the tax code to
encourage conservation--but did not say how they would offset
costs of any tax credits the energy bill might include. Democrats
and Republicans face a tight budget environment because much of
the budget surplus is off the table because of the tax cut.
   But he gave no indication that Democrats planned to revisit
the $1.35 trillion tax bill that President Bush will sign today.
   "The budget is passed. The tax cut is passed. That largely
settled those fiscal policy issues for the year." Dorgan said.
   Dorgan, who will chair the Senate Treasury-Postal
Appropriations Subcommittee, predicted little change at the
Appropriations Committee with Democrats now running the show.
   Citing his friendly working relationship with subcommittee
ranking member Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., Dorgan noted
that "most subcommittees work together in a bipartisan way," and
anticipated little change in the panel's spending priorities
under his chairmanship.
   The real problems are likely to come at the end of the year,
when appropriators are bumping up against the budget caps at the
same time they are trying to move the two largest spending
bills--Defense and Labor-HHS.
   With little room to maneuver, Congress might again be forced
to declare some spending as emergencies in order to keep from
busting the budget, or round up the 60 votes needed in the Senate
to raise the caps.
   The Senate faces similar constraints with the nearly $7
billion FY01 supplemental Bush sent to Capitol Hill last week.
   With only $500 million in offsets, the supplemental uses up
nearly the entire $6.5 billion by which Congress raised the FY01
in the budget resolution. Any more spending added to the
supplemental therefore would have to be offset or declared an
emergency.
   But OMB Director Daniels has already laid down the gauntlet--
cautioning Congress Tuesday not to bid up the supplemental or use
emergency declarations or other accounting gimmicks to spend
beyond the 4 percent increase for FY02 the administration has
called for. Otherwise, be prepared for presidential vetoes,
Daniels warned this week.
   In remarks that echoed the private grumblings of other
appropriators, Dorgan said: "Mitch Daniels is sounding his
political horn these days. I would sooner he just get down to
business and work with us, and back off the politics just a
little bit."
   Dorgan shied away from major political predictions about how
the year would unfold, although he reflected on several new
trends.
   "[Majority Leader] Daschle will play a much more pivotal role
in national politics now than he did as minority leader," he
said.
   Dorgan said Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' switch to independent
status is "not likely to be repeated in this Congress" by other
senators. A close confidant of the new leader, Dorgan praised
Daschle for his decentralized leadership style.
   "He brings people in. He meets ... He has the patience of
Job," declared Dorgan.
   Dorgan said the policy committee that he and Daschle chair
will switch from playing occasional "defense" to developing more
of an issues agenda.
   Dorgan chided Minority Leader Lott for stifling Democratic
amendments when Republicans were in the majority.
   "Senator Lott was someone who was concerned with having
absolute control on the floor of issues," he said, adding that
Democratic leaders have discussed how they will operate
differently.
   "I suspect you will see legislation coming to the floor of the
Senate without the restrictions Senator Lott imposed." Dorgan
said.
   Dorgan acknowledged that Democrats had to try to accommodate
Republicans because they hold such a narrow majority.
   "There's certainly a danger of high expectations," he said.
"Nothing much has changed, except the majority leader and the
committee chairs. The Republicans learned and we understand that
it's not easy to get things done in a Senate that's evenly
split." -- By Geoff Earle and Lisa Caruso

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Organizing Talks Continue; Daschle Asks Monday-Friday Schedule
   A team of five Republican senators met for a second time
Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Daschle to negotiate a new
organizing resolution to reflect Democratic control of the
Senate--and for the second straight day the two sides described
"productive" and "cordial" talks but reported no final agreement.
   "We had a good meeting and that's all I can say," Daschle said
late Wednesday.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the negotiating team had
another "good, productive meeting" with Daschle, adding: "I
believe we're making progress. Everybody wants to solve this
thing...I think we pretty well have done what we want to do."
   Moderate GOP Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said he
believed "some reality has set in" among his Republican
colleagues, many of whom were urging a hard line in the
negotiations earlier this week.
   "There were a lot less aggressive tones today [in a meeting of
the GOP Conference] than even back in January," when the power-
sharing agreement was negotiated for a 50-50 Senate. "[And] it
was a much more logical conversation" than earlier in the week,
he said. "There wasn't much of a moderate/conservative split in
there."
   One change will soon become evident in the Senate. Daschle
said the chamber would begin working on a Monday-through-Friday
schedule.
   Throughout the day Wednesday, Republicans continued to raise
the issue of judicial and other nominees, although the demand for
written assurances that such nominations would receive a floor
vote seemed to recede as the day progressed.
   Still, Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said there was "broad
concern within the [GOP] Conference that members of the new
majority have made statements that would change the precedent on
nominees."
   Santorum said he had "never called for a rules change" to
address the issue, but said he was concerned by comments he
attributed to Judiciary Chairman Leahy that nominees can be
disqualified simply because they are conservatives.
   "We need to confirm with the Democratic side that there will
be no break with precedent," he said.
   But Santorum agreed that the operating resolution should be
resolved within "another day or so."
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a senior member of the Judiciary
Committee, was dismissive of the idea that Bush administration
nominees should receive any special consideration.
   "Bill Lan Lee is my answer to that," he said, in reference to
a Clinton administration Justice Department nomination that
Republicans refused to bring forward for a vote. "We will hear
from the Justice Department [on judicial nominees] and we will
have full and fair hearings. But there is no presumption to be on
the Supreme Court."
   GOP Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho, said one
of the options Republicans were discussing was dealing with their
concerns about nominations "for the record," either through a
"dialogue" on the Senate floor or through some other type of
understanding. He predicted that negotiations could be completed
today, although he said his guess was it would not be voted on
until next week.
   "The option is to take the appropriate time," Craig said.
   Craig agreed with statements by Daschle that the two parties
might try to reach an understanding that if Republicans were to
regain control, the now defunct 50-50 power sharing resolution
would again take effect.
   "That's probably fairly close," said Craig, who also seemed to
indicate that Democrats had reacted favorably to some GOP
suggestions. "We've asked for several things that they think are
fair that we think are fair."
   But he also acknowledged that as the minority party,
Republicans had limited tools at their disposal. "We cannot scalp
Pat Leahy," he said of the Judiciary Committee chairman. -- By

Morella Declines Governor Bid; Focus Shifts To Ehrlich
   Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., disclosed Tuesday that she
would not run for governor in 2002--while all but saying that she
will seek re-election to a ninth term, the Baltimore Sun
reported.
   "My concentration has always been in my district, I like where
I am," said Morella, who was first elected in 1986 to her
Montgomery County-based seat.
   The decision turns the statewide spotlight on GOP Rep. Robert
Ehrlich, who plans to make an announcement this summer on whether
he will seek the governor's office.
   But pollster Keith Haller said Morella's announcement is a big
setback for the Maryland Republican Party--because polls showed
her to be a formidable statewide candidate, and because Democrats
would have a hard time as portraying the politically moderate
Morella as out of the mainstream. Ehrlich as regarded as more
conservative.
   But Haller added, "Ehrlich now has a wide-open opportunity to
assume the Republican mantle should he believe it's politically
feasible."
   The leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination is Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of the
late Sen. Robert Kennedy, D-N.Y.
   Even though she has taken herself out of contention for
governor, Morella may still face a member of the Kennedy dynasty
next year: state Del. Mark Shriver, son of Special Olympics
founder Eunice Kennedy Shriver, has announced he will seek
Morella's House seat.

Davis Appeals To GOP Lawmakers For Donations To Forbes
   National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis
of Virginia appealed to GOP House members Wednesday for donations
to the congressional bid of state Sen. Randy Forbes in a
forthcoming Virginia special election.
   Davis noted that 71 GOP members have already contributed to
the Forbes campaign, and urged the remaining 150 GOP Conference
members to pony up as well.
   Forbes is running against Democratic state Sen. Louise Lucas
in the June 19 special election for the 4th District seat of the
late Democratic Rep. Norman Sisisky. The politically marginal
district stretches across southern Virginia from the Richmond
area to Portsmouth.
   A NRCC spokesman confirmed the Davis request, saying, "It's a
close race, and we need all the help we can get."
   House Majority Whip DeLay Wednesday also briefed the GOP
Conference of his ROMP and STOMP programs.
   ROMP--the Retain Our Majority Program--encourages safe
incumbents to contribute excess campaign contributions to
vulnerable GOP members.
   STOMP--the Strategic Task Force for Organizing and Mobilizing
People--is designed to build a grassroots response to such
traditional Democratic allies as organized labor and
environmental activists.

In Mich., GOP Keeps Searching For Levin Foe
   Having already been turned down by a number of potential
candidates, Michigan Republicans are continuing their search for
a 2002 candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Carl Levin--who
Wednesday assumed the chairmanship of the Armed Services
Committee with the Senate's shift to Democratic control.
   Businessman Jim Nicholson, who lost a 1996 bid for the GOP
nomination against Levin, told The Detroit News that "it will
take brave people" to consider going against Levin, while adding,
"And I may be one of them." Nicholson said he would not decide
until late this year.
   Another possible Levin challenger getting high marks from the
state GOP headquarters is businessman David Brandon, a close ally
of GOP Gov. John Engler who is a University of Michigan trustee.
A party spokesman said Brandon is "a guy with a good story who
would be a good candidate."
   Another close Engler associate--Dan Pero, a former Engler
chief of staff who managed two of the governor's campaigns--last
month took himself out of the running.

Backus Moving From DNC To DCCC
   Jenny Backus says she decided to leave her post as spokeswoman

COLUMN: ON THE MONEY
A Train Wreck Wrecker?
   When you ask most people how this year's appropriations season
will go, they let out a groan reminiscent of Lurch on "The Addams
Family." But not Mitch Daniels. The OMB director still thinks
everything may turn out OK--although he is a little less
optimistic now that the Democrats have taken over the Senate.
   "We're very serious about this being an orderly process,"
Daniels said in an interview this week. Asked if the process can
be smooth, Daniels said, "We'll find out." But he also said, "I'm
confident we were on our way to that and I'm confident we can
still do it." He conceded that working with Democrats leading the
Senate may be different from working with the Republicans, but
said, "We'll have to be flexible where we can be."
   For the past few years of the Clinton administration, then-OMB
Director Lew started the season with a speech in which he
projected gloom and doom: The budget resolution contained false
numbers....They were too low....Nobody believed that was the
amount the government really would spend....We would end up in a
budget confrontation at the end of the fiscal year, and the
confrontation would drag into November or later....
   Many predict the same endgame this year. They contend
education, defense and other priorities will exceed the budget
resolution, and the spending caps will be increased.
   Daniels is making it clear that that is not acceptable. Rather
than start with a speech, he opened the appropriations season
with an op-ed piece in the Washington Post, in which he
emphasized that the administration wants to stick with this
year's budget resolution.
   In this week's interview, Daniels said he is trying to change
the way OMB interacts with Congress to try to convince members.
Republicans used to complain that OMB only entered the
appropriations process at the end--when the president threatened
a veto and the endgame negotiations had to begin.
   Daniels said OMB is trying to work with Congress at the start
of the process. Asked when his office became involved, he
commented, "Have been, are, will be." OMB officials already have
met with appropriations subcommittee staff and will continue to
do so throughout the process, Daniels said. The new strategy was
a careful calculation, he said. As a former Senate staffer, he
certainly realizes that members carefully protect their
prerogatives. And he kept saying OMB would be only as involved as
appropriators want them to be. But having said that, Daniels
added, "From the beginning, it seemed clear to me that we wanted
to be in body contact with the appropriators all the way, and we
have been."
   However, he is not sure how the appropriations dynamic changes
with changeover in the Senate. "This moves the needle a little
bit, but not far." As Republicans have been fond of pointing out,
the membership of the Senate has not changed.
   But of course, being bipartisan means swallowing hard
sometimes and being willing to compromise--even on pork barrel
projects, a particular target of the administration. President
Bush has made it clear he wants to cut down on earmarked
projects. In the supplemental spending bill sent to Congress this
month, Bush proposed to rescind some $93 million earmarked last
year for I-49 in Arkansas--money put in the Transportation bill
to try to help the unsuccessful re-election campaign of former
appropriator Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark.
   The proposed rescission has been criticized--and clearly is a
sign that Bush is targeting such projects. Even so, Daniels said
the administration realizes it is going to have to be somewhat
pragmatic. "We called a lot of attention to the sixfold explosion
of earmarks, which is a distinctly bipartisan phenomenon,"
Daniels said. But he quickly added: "We do think this trend ought
to be reined in, but we're realistic. To the extent that this is
a lubricant to the process or a bipartisan process, we recognize
that a lot of it will go on."
   Although Democrats have repeatedly criticized this year's
budget process, Daniels believes it worked "fine." But Bush has
proposed a series of budget reforms--ranging from a two-year
budget cycle to an automatic continuing resolution that would go
into effect if Congress did not complete the 13 annual funding
bills by the end of the year.
   Daniels said that reform of the CR process would be a good
place to start. Appropriators have said they believe an automatic
CR takes away all of the incentive to complete the 13 individual
bills. The administration believes just the opposite. "The
president interprets it as a way to move the process to
conclusion to avoid end-of-session chaos," said Daniels.
   And of course, end-of-session chaos is something everyone--
especially the president--would like to avoid. -- By  David

COLUMN: HOUSE RACE HOTLINE
A Very Special Time Of Year
   2001 hardly has been an "off year" in the House, with a total
of six special elections slated--and it's only June. However,
unlike in most presidential inaugural years, just one of the six
special elections resulted from a job offer with the
administration. The remaining special elections resulted from two
resignations--both by members of the president's party--and three
deaths.
   As expected, former state Sen. Diane Watson won Tuesday's
special election in California's heavily Democratic 32nd
District. That race, along with last month's special election in
Pennsylvania's heavily Republican 9th District, set the pattern
for the majority of 2001 special elections.  They hold heavily
competitive primaries--or district conventions--with the eventual
winner cruising to victory in the special general election.
   The exception to that rule is in Virginia's 4th District,
which is known as "the only game in the country." The race to
replace the late Democratic Rep. Norman Sisisky matches two state
senators in a district that President Bush carried by just 500
votes last November.
   While pressure to hold the seat lies with the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, the Republicans boast a home-
field advantage, with fellow Virginia Rep. Tom Davis at the helm
of the National Republican Congressional Committee and Gov. James
Gilmore leading the Republican National Committee. Voters will
head to the polls June 19.
   Here is your primer on the remaining primary-to-watch
specials:
   Massachusetts 09: In February, the late Democratic Rep. Joe
Moakley announced he would not run for re-election in 2002 due to
incurable leukemia, so potential candidates had been jockeying
for his seat well before his death on Memorial Day. The current
frontrunner--at least in the media--is Max Kennedy, one of the
younger sons of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, D-N.Y. But the
"frontrunner" title is very tenuous: The Kennedy clan publicly
expressed concern about Max's bid after early missteps.
   Early speculation circulated that Kennedy's chief competitor,
state Sen. Stephen Lynch, would run as an independent, to avoid a
crowded Democratic primary that would give Kennedy an advantage.
Then he would take on Kennedy one-on-one. Some observers believe
that if a Kennedy is beatable, it would be in a special election
primary held this year--not in a regular primary held 15 months
from now. Acting GOP Gov. Jane Swift has yet to announce a
special election.
   Arkansas 03: Originally, the race to replace GOP Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, Bush's appointment to lead the Drug Enforcement
Administration, was set up to be a race between two of Arkansas'
political families--the Hutchinsons and the Huckabees. However,
not one but two of GOP Gov. Mike Huckabee's candidates have
dropped out. Meanwhile, Hutchinson's nephew, former state Rep.
Jim Hendren, dropped out, only to decide the next day that he was
back in.
   When the seat opened up, a member of another political family,
state Sen. Gunner DeLay, said he would defer to Hendren. However,
after Hendren's indecision, House Majority Whip DeLay's cousin
moved ahead with plans to run.
   While this is a solidly Republican seat--then-President
Clinton couldn't even carry his hometown district in 1996--a
number of Democrats are considering bids, because in a special,
you just never know. The date of this special election has not
been set yet, since Hutchinson is not resigning from the seat
until he is confirmed by the Senate.
   Florida 01: After a fake retirement announcement was the
subject of a radio station's April Fool gag, GOP Rep. Joe
Scarborough fooled us all in late May by announcing he would
resign in September. Scarborough took the seat from Democrats in
1994 GOP landslide, and Republicans are heavily favored to hold
this district.  In fact, the chief of staff to former Democratic
Rep. Earl Hutto is running as a Republican.
   To date, things appear to be in a minor mess, as no fewer than
18 candidates are currently looking at the race--including a
father and a son running against each other. GOP Gov. Jeb Bush
has set a special election for October 16, with the primary July
24 and a runoff Sept. 4.
   Meanwhile, in Ohio's 17th District, talk is already swirling
about a potential special election if indicted Democratic Rep.
James Traficant is convicted. The Warren Tribune-Chronicle
speculated that after the case goes to trial next February, the
state "might be able to fit either the primary for the special
election or the special election itself" on May 7--which would
coincide with the regular primary for Congress.
   Add the fact that redistricting would have two different sets
of voters in Ohio's 17th District, and this special election
could be the most special--or at least most interesting--of them
all. -- By Charles Todd and Maureen Hurley Schweers

ENVIRONMENT
Administration Will Address Global Warming, Rice Says
   White House National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice
indicated Wednesday that the administration will advance ideas
about global warming before President Bush leaves for Europe next
week, but she was unclear about whether Bush himself will speak
on the issue, as many expect.
   Rice said Bush would be ready to share "what we've learned
thus far" with the allies during his trip. Rice, who briefed
reporters on the trip agenda, said the Cabinet-level group
mulling the issue has not determined what it will tell the
president before he embarks.
   But she indicated that whatever information it gives Bush, the
group will not issue final recommendations before he meets with
European leaders, who have criticized his decision to scrap the
Kyoto treaty.
   Rice confirmed that Bush believes global warming is taking
place but added that the advisory group--which includes EPA
Administrator Whitman, Energy Secretary Abraham, Treasury
Secretary O'Neill, Interior Secretary Norton and White House
National Economic Council Director Larry Lindsey--is trying to
"understand better what we don't know."
   Rice said the panel is exploring the evidence that
"sequestration"--the removal of carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere by plant life--can "play a role in dealing with
emissions,"among other proposals.

POLITICS
Moderate Republicans Help Dems Win First Senate Vote
   Moderate Republicans helped Senate Democrats win their first
vote since Democrats took control of the chamber Wednesday on an
amendment, sponsored by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., to the
education bill.  It requires states to develop quality, peer-
reviewed tests before receiving grants.
   But Democrats may face a more difficult challenge today.
   Wellstone, along with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is
planning to offer an amendment to prevent states from being
required to comply with President Bush's plan to test every child
in grades 3-8, unless the federal government fully funds Title I.
   Title I provides funds to educate poor and disadvantaged
students, and Democrats have argued that traditionally it has
been underfunded.
   Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy,
who is managing the bill on the floor, will oppose the so-called
"trigger" amendment because it would "undercut the bill," a
spokesman said.
   "Senator Kennedy shares Sen. Wellstone's concern....  However,
efforts to secure additional funding should not set back the
efforts to put into place the quality assessments," said a
spokesman.

TRADE
Bush Orders Permits For Firms To Truck International Cargo
   President Bush ordered Wednesday that U.S. businesses owned by
Mexican citizens be permitted to truck international cargo
between points within the United States.
   The order, in a memorandum to Transportation Secretary Mineta
that will be published in the Federal Register, implements a
portion of a NAFTA arbitration panel decision against U.S.
treatment of Mexican trucking firms. The order does not affect
the right of Mexican trucks to enter the United States, a portion
of the decision that has not yet been implemented.
   Under Wednesday's order, Mexican-owned enterprises also will
be allowed to provide bus service within the United States. Bush
directed the Transportation Department to "expeditiously"
implement the order.

New Democrat Coalition To Kick-Start `E-Genda'
   Five members of the New Democrat Coalition are scheduled to
kick-start their e-commerce "e-genda" by introducing a House
resolution calling for businesses, government agencies and
Congress members to incorporate the Platform for Privacy
Preferences technology into their Web sites, a technology policy
analyst for the Progressive Policy Institute told National
Journal's Technology Daily.
   Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is expected to introduce a
resolution supported by California Reps. Calvin Dooley and Ellen
Tauscher, as well as Reps. James Moran of Virginia and Rick
Larsen of Washington.
   All five lawmakers also are expected to announce that their
Web sites are compliant with P3P, a technology that its
supporters say will help users preserve their online privacy.
   The new Democrats' "e-genda" will be released later this

Some things to consider --

A. Enron Response to Alliance Compliance Filing (pre-MISO/ARTO discussions)

1. Stakeholder Process
 a. Getting better, more meetings post EPSA letter
2. Day One Congestion Management (not much to discuss, already approved by 
FERC)
3. Key Issue - Many details left uncertain until ARTO filing 120 days prior 
to 12/15/01

RECOMMENDATION - Don't file right now.  Talk with FERC staff about our Wish 
List for RTOs. Work through RTO process to implement.

B. National Grid Operation of ARTO (Comments June 14/01)

1. Should Enron Oppose NG?

Yes a. Unclear about how much control NG has in the process (complete tariff 
control?).
 b. There are issues about NG independence from market (NE and NY assets).

No a. NG wants to be a Transco in the ultimate state.
 b. This is a mid-term solution that could work.
 c. If done right, better opportunity to deal with transmission issues than 
current structure.

RECOMMENDATION - Enron should file comments on key open policy issues with 
for-profit Gridco model.  

We don't oppose, but we are concerned that controls must be in place to 
ensure well functioning markets.
The Transco model is the best model for transmission operation.  If this 
action by NG leads ultimately to a Transco, it is a good outcome.
The operator of RTO tariff must be independent of all market players (NG owns 
generation and has distribution in New England).  Transelect wrote "I believe 
quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the Grid is a 
significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in the Northeast 
(New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small step from this 
decision to one that would allow Southern to operate GridSouth, or one that 
would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in exchange for FP&L operating 
the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National policy, transmission operators 
should be independent of either the wholesale or retail electric markets.  As 
a business issue, many transmission owners are reluctant to divest of 
transmission because they retain hope that their transmission can be used to 
protect above market native generation.  How would you like to try shipping 
power into the Northeast with the Grid, a major retail supplier and a 
significant generator, controlling access to the market?"  We  should make 
this argument very strongly.  NG must have a plan to divest itself of the 
generation and distribution side of the business because NE and NY are 
economically viable markets impacted by the Alliance RTO.
The Operator of RTO must have full authority to modify the tariff and 
operations of the RTO.  The Transmission Providers should not be able to 
restrict or limit in any fashion the for-profit Gridco Operator beyond 
ensuring (1) technical proficency, (2) assets returned in reasonable manner, 
and (3) recovery of FERC approved revenue requirement.

Here is a brief synopsis of my view of LDC gas hedging, which I just chewed 
Harry's ear off explaining:

1.  Commission needs to understand how hedging works.  In a typical market 
situation, the supplier of a good negotiates with the consumer, who can 
explain to the supplier what his appetite for risk and term is, and then the 
supplier can come up with the appropriate pricing and term (eg. all spot, 
fixed price, pricing within a band). In other words, the hedge reflects the 
customer's specific wants and needs.

2.  When a utility tries to hedge for its amorphous group of bundled sales 
customers, it lacks the specific knowledge of  the appetite for risk that 
group has, and in fact, the appetites will be all over the place.  Therefore, 
the hedging will not be perfect.  If a utility locks in some pricing at term, 
there is always the risk that a hindsight regulatory review will find that 
the price was too high in light of later market developments, or that too 
much reliance was placed on spot, which may have moved up.  What utilities 
need then, is the guidance to hedge, and then freedom from hindsight review.  
(This gives ENA a good market for its hedged products and removes regulatory 
risk involved with those products.)

3.  When the utility hedges, it faces potential stranded costs, which arise 
if load leaves.  Thus, to mitigate the potential and size of this problem, 
the hedged portfolio should only be dedicated to those customers for whom 
leaving for transportation is not a real option (residential and small 
commercial).  If larger customers are on sales service, their rates should 
reflect market index prices, as they do have the ability to leave, and spot 
pricing removes the stranded cost and undercollection concerns.  (It also 
gives us something easy to market against).  In other words, we need 2 PGA's, 
one for captive customers and one for non-captive customers.

4.  To make this 2-part world work, there must be in place an effective 
transportation program that enables larger customers to shop for their own 
supplies in the competitive market.

Sue, I will be in Houston Tues afternoon and Wed. if you want to meet to 
discuss.

As you may recall, Portland General submitted a request to FERC for 
authorization to use EnronOnline.  Due to FERC's affiliate restrictions, PGE 
currently is not able to use EnronOnline and is concerned that it is being 
excluded from parts of the market due to the restrictions.  We made a similar 
filing on behalf of EPMI, proposing to remove the affiliate restrictions for 
those transactions that EPMI enters into with PGE through EnronOnline.

The PGE and EPMI filings are on FERC's July 11 agenda.  Although the FERC 
staffers conducting the inquiry into EnronOnline have told us that their 
inquiry is not related to the PGE and EPMI applications, FERC's order will be 
the first pronouncement from FERC on EnronOnline since this new inquiry began.

We'll keep you posted and will send out the order as soon as we receive it.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.

After our discussion at lunch last Thursday, I think I need more advice from 
you on how to deal with the sort of intervention you can see below!! I tried 
really hard to cover all the bases on this initiative, nearly all face to 
face. Then Paul H didn't turn up at the staff meeting on Monday and I get the 
e-mailed questions you see below (when he could have come to chat to me about 
it.) I will of course try to smooth over things verbally with Paul, but if 
this is what happens when I "give up" 30% of the time of a direct report to 
benefit her career development and the company's biz. priorities, you will 
understand some frustration on my part at our current arrangements!!

Subject: Nailia's opportunity to work more on the trading floor  

I have made no formal request to HR for housing, Paul. As you know, I have 
agreed with Eric Shaw, Paul Mead, Paul Dawson and Alfredo Huertas that Nailia 
will spend c. 30% of her time in the next six months working on Italian reg. 
issues, and that to facilitate that role and to help her get better exposure 
to commercial teams on EU issues too, she will spend on average three days a 
week over that period on the trading floor, next to the Italian team. (We 
announced all of this in the staff meeting yesterday.)  

Her travel to London tends to be weekly already, and is done on a very 
reasonable Eurostar youth fare basis. I think the budget question then is 
simply: Is it more efficient for the company to pay for a hotel room two, 
three or four nights a week or to allow Nailia to take a cheap flat share? 
The latter may well work out better, especially taking into account the 
flexibility it will allow. I am told Tara Rozen has a suggestion. Let's see 
the comparison; then I agree the four of us should judge together. I'll keep 
you informed. Give me a call if you have any other concerns about any aspect 
of the arrangements.

Peter.

Peter

I understand from Sophie Kingsley that a request has been placed with her to 
secure housing for
Nailia in London for a few days each week for the next several months. I have 
discussed this with Doug and Paul.
We would like to discuss this with you to understand the thinking behind this 
as well as the expense. It seems reasonable
in these days of cost cutting that we make these decisions jointly. Thanks

Paul

VERIZON PLANS PENNSYLVANIA InterLATA BID
THIS MONTH AFTER PUC GIVES CONDITIONAL SUPPORT

Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., plans to accept conditions that the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission imposed today on its
support for the company's planned application to provide
interLATA (local access and transport area) services in the
state.   The company expects to file its application later this
month with the FCC, which, under the Telecommunications Act of
1996, will consult with the U.S. Department of Justice and the
relevant state regulators before issuing a decision.  The state
regulators' role is to advise the FCC on whether a Bell company
has complied with the local exchange market-opening mandates of
the Act.

In a 3-2 vote, the PUC told Verizon that it must agree to a
permanent performance assurance plan with "self-executing"
remedies based on the New York model already accepted by the FCC.
The company also must withdraw its pending judicial challenge of
the PUC's authority to impose remedies aimed at preventing
backsliding on local exchange market-opening commitments.  The
PUC said the company must agree to increase certain penalties
from $5,000 to $25,000.  And the commission said Verizon must
agree to increase remedies for failing to provide accurate
electronic billing to competitors; the company could face
payments as high as $100,000 per affected competitive local
exchange carrier for missing an electronic billing standard.

Commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Terrance J. Fitzpatrick
dissented.  Commissioner Brownell said, "I cannot, in good
conscience, affirm that these markets are open as envisioned
under the Act."  Both dissenting commissioners listed several
areas in which Verizon had failed to show that local markets are
open to competition.  But Colleen McCloskey, senior vice
president-state government relations and external affairs at
Verizon, said she believed those concerns were addressed by the
conditions the PUC laid out.

Ms. McCloskey noted that New York, Massachusetts, and
Pennsylvania comprise the lion's share of Verizon Communications,
Inc.'s access lines.  Verizon already is providing interLATA
service in New York and Massachusetts.  Winning approval in
Pennsylvania would mean the company is making substantial
progress toward meeting an FCC requirement for Verizon's
regaining control of Internet backbone service provider Genuity,
Inc.  Verizon spun that unit off last year as a condition of the
FCC's approval of a merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp.,
which formed Verizon.

A WorldCom, Inc., spokesman told TR, "We agree with the [PUC]
dissenters.  We hope the FCC will recognize that problems still
exist and force Verizon to fix them prior to allowing it to offer
long distance."


***************************************************************
NEW COMMISSIONER ABERNATHY SEEKS MEETINGS WITH LAWMAKERS

FCC Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy, still in her first week
on the job, already is sending letters to members of Congress
seeking meetings to discuss the Commission's work.  In an
interview today with TR, she said she viewed her new role as an
interpreter of Congress's statutory mandate.  The public never
has a chance to vote for FCC Commissioners, unlike members of
Congress, she noted.

Many of the predictions and assumptions made about the pace of
technological and market change when the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 was passed were wrong, Ms. Abernathy said.  But that
doesn't mean the Act has been a failure, she added.  She cited
increasing choices for consumers as one of the positive gains
made since 1996.

The commissioner, who was director-government affairs at
Broadband Office, Inc., emphasized the importance of information
provided by Congress, industry officials, consumer groups, and
state regulators.  Despite her experience in various industry
segments, she's "not an engineer or an economist," she said.  She
appreciates organized presentations and creative ideas, she
added.

See Monday's TR for a full transcript of the interview.

TWO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CHALLENGE FCC's ANTENNA LICENSING
PROCEDURES

Two environmental groups have launched an attack on the FCC's
antenna licensing process, saying the agency should assess the
"direct, indirect, and cumulative effects" before issuing new
licenses.  Friends of the Earth and the Forest Conservation
Council issued their appeal in petitions asking the FCC to deny
33 antenna license applications.

The groups say the environmental assessments prepared for those
projects fail to include the information and analysis mandated by
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Council of Envi-
ronmental Quality regulations, and FCC rules.  In addition,
applicants failed to meet the requirements of the Endangered
Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act, the groups allege.

The companies seeking permission to build the new antennas
dismiss the charges.  They say their applications fully comply
with applicable regulations.  The environmental groups fail to
provide any specific justification or evidence against their
projects and lack standing in the proceeding, the companies say.
The groups' challenge should be raised in a formal rulemaking
proceeding, they add.

"Of course the Commission must consider and evaluate good-faith
challenges to environmental compliance," American Tower L.P. said
in defense of its plans for a Maryland antenna tower.
"Complaints as vague, insubstantial, and deficient as those in
the present petition, however, are unfair, waste already strained
compliance resources of both Commission and applicants, and can
cause serious harm to a given tower project or even to [the]
overall industry, through unnecessary construction delay and
regulatory uncertainty."

A spokeswoman for the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
said today that agency officials were reviewing the environmental
groups' petitions.

TIA PARTNERS WITH USAID TO BOOST OVERSEAS TELECOM SALES

The Telecommunications Industry Association has signed a
memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) to help U.S. telecom equipment
vendors increase sales in developing countries.  USAID will
provide access to its "global technology network" (GTN), which
assists U.S. small and midsize companies by matching prospective
buyers and sellers.

TIA said the agreement should increase the volume of new business
leads and deals in emerging markets.  "TIA and GTN share the
common goals of promoting economic development through business
enterprise," said TIA President Matthew Flanigan.

FCC OPENS AUCTION OF VHF, LMS LICENSES

An FCC auction of 16 VHF (very high frequency) public coast
licenses and 241 location and monitoring service (LMS) licenses
opened today.  Net bids totaled $284,805 by the time bidding was
done for the day after the fourth round.  There are seven
eligible bidders in the sale.

Telesaurus Holdings GB LLC was the top bidder for in the LMS
auction, offering $158,535 for 106 licenses.  SMR Systems, Inc.,
led in the public coast auction, bidding $17,550 for six
licenses.  The licenses were unsold at two auctions in 1998 and
1999 (TR, Dec. 21, 1998, and March 8, 1999).

The technology industry last year experienced its slowest growth
rate since 1994-1995, according to a report released today by AeA
(formerly the American Electronics Association).  The
"Cyberstates 2001" report "confirms that the current high-tech
slowdown began in 2000," AeA President William T. Archey said.
"And many current indicators point to a continued slowing of
growth for 2001.  Yet despite the present economic uncertainty,
some states have flourished," he said.  The 160-page report found
that all states, except for West Virginia, experienced growth in
high-tech employment between 1999 and 2000.  For more
information, go to AeA's Web site, http://www.aeanet.org, or call
800/284-4232.

Beyond the two excellent editorials in today's WSJ (attached) the following 
should be the key messages:

1.  The show was an aimless wander through the well-worn territory of 
blame-game politics, with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in.

2.  It should not surprise anyone that two Berkley-based journalists, working 
in conjunction with the New York Times, would ignore Econ 101 and suggest 
that the solution for California's energy crisis is to subject the entire 
nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations.  Such pinings have been 
abandoned over the past 65 years, but if the New York Times wants to stake 
out that position ... fine.  It will probably help sharpen the debate and set 
up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices 
moderate.  (Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New 
Deal regulations.)

3.  The show completely ignored the failings of California's political and 
regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had 
a chance.

4.  Of the electricity consumed in California, less than 15 percent is 
generated by companies headquartered in Texas.  More than 50 percent of the 
electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been 
charging the same high prices as the Texas "pirates."  These good pirates 
include the Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, the Government of British Columbia, and the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District.




Business World: California's Ship of Fools
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A27
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Lamenting the politician's lot in "Profiles in Courage," John F. Kennedy 
wrote that "In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice 
honors, prestige and his chosen career on a single issue." Of course, no 
politician would last long if he didn't blow with the wind nine times out of 
10. But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some 
courage. 
We don't know what happens when an advanced economy like California's suffers 
day after day of blackouts. We may be about to find out. Modern office 
architecture becomes uninhabitable without air-conditioning and elevators. 
Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat. So may drivers at unlit 
traffic crossings.
Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts, but voters wouldn't know 
the difference, and it's so much easier to cast blame. Gov. Gray Davis prates 
about a "war with Texas." And who knows what secret failures as a human being 
led Bill Lockyer, the attorney general, to threaten Enron's Ken Lay with 
homosexual rape in the California prison system. 
California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of 
crisis. Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Davis harp on price, but the true problem is the 
unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the 
current structure of retail rates. 
Both must know the solution they noisily advocate, federal price controls 
slapped across Western electricity markets, wouldn't bring power into 
existence to close the gap. Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with 
the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from California's mistakes across 
half a dozen other states. 
In California itself, municipal utilities in Santa Clara, Palo Alto and other 
towns have already announced they won't participate in rolling blackouts. The 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isn't volunteering. Why 
should voters in other states? Why not just cut the lines and let California 
monopolize the darkness? A state review board in Washington has already 
vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined 
for California. 
Mr. Davis knows this; he knows price controls would create a new problem 
without solving the shortages. Meanwhile, the specter nobody wants to talk 
about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues 
to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded 
from the true cost of power. 
Mr. Davis's version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame. Texas companies 
account for just 12% of California's supply, having bought 7,000 of the 
20,000 megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under 
"deregulation." Being in the right place at the right time has always been 
profitable, but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas, 
pipeline capacity, storage and ancillary services. Take Enron: Its revenues 
quadrupled in the past year, but so did its costs, and profits are up only 
31%. 
A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest "gougers" BC Hydro, 
owned by Canadian taxpayers, and the U.S. Bonneville Power Administration. 
Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local 
needs with spot-market power, so they could sell their own production for 
higher prices to California during the day. 
These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed 
across the West, making the shortages worse, probably much worse. 
Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro they've 
been passing on to California -- 3,000 megawatts, enough for two million 
homes. Farmers could resume irrigating. Seattle, Tacoma, Boise and other 
neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do, hiking rates to 
curb demand. 
Rather than emulate them, Gov. Davis's peacock of an energy czar, David 
Freeman, babbles about "public power," the answer to a question nobody asked, 
the solution to a nonexistent problem. 
Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling 
as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the state's 
future needs. Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr. Freeman's antique 
New Deal schemes. What's been missing while folks like him ride their hobby 
horses, though, is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the 
suffering this summer. 
One large source of untapped power is California's own small generators, 
known as qualifying facilities. Their fee scale is set by the state, but 
California couldn't even summon the political competence to keep them in 
business, so 3,000 megawatts sit idle. 
People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the 
California mess, but we wouldn't be here if water flows in the Columbia River 
system weren't down 54% from normal. Last summer, California's fossil-fuel 
generators increased their output by a whopping 62% to make up the shortfall, 
mostly by running existing plants harder. 
Yes, there have been flaky prices, partly because, mysteriously, California 
continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its 
power one hour in advance. But the flaky prices also represent a system 
pulling out all stops to save California from itself. 
We said back in December there's only one solution: Jack up rates to stop 
consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg, borrow or steal. 
The only question was when Gov. Davis would find the courage. Hard to 
believe, but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on 
the drawing board and busily being watered down. 
Someone should point out to Gov. Davis that the author of "Profiles in 
Courage" wasn't endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must 
husband their leadership for times when it really counts. Not a few people in 
public life understand this. Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could 
justify the compromises and trimming he's done in his life. But Mr. Davis is 
perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to 
have a political career. 
What borders on the stupefying, though, is the failure of any other 
Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power 
crisis. By all rights Gov. Davis should be a political leper, yet he actually 
stands a microscopic chance of being re-elected because of the sheer poverty, 
in a state of 34 million people, of the Republican opposition. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
California Squeaks By

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A26
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray 
Davis has done nothing but squeak at it. At first, he attacked out-of-state 
power generators for being pirates and marauders. But lately he has focused 
on FERC and President Bush, demanding that the federal government place price 
caps on the sale of wholesale power. He's even rustled up 10 economists -- 
including the dad of deregulation, Alfred Kahn -- to support him. 
Well, as most everybody knows -- including the economists who have come out 
in favor of them -- price caps don't work. If caps are set too low, (as 
politics often dictate), existing supply will shrink and demand will grow, 
making the situation worse. Even "correctly" set price caps will discourage 
additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand. The usual result is an 
aggravation of shortages and rationing. Indeed, the history of price caps, 
particularly during the energy crisis in the early 1970s -- when oil prices 
were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long -- bears this out.
The pro-price-caps argument however is a clever one. It rests on the notion 
that there is no "effective competition" in the California energy market. 
According to one of the 10 pro-price-cap economists, Paul Joskow at MIT, the 
energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very, 
very tight supplies, which conspire to produce, at certain times, prices 
above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions. 
Mr. Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of 2000, 
looking at market fundamentals (the broad forces determining supply and 
demand); he found that 25% to 30% of the wholesale prices of electricity 
during June, July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and 
should be attributed to market imperfections. 
As an argument for price caps, this is hardly overwhelming. Especially since 
there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no 
further than market fundamentals. Such as the fact that the price of the most 
important input for almost half the electricity generated in California, 
natural gas, has been rising over the past year. Such as the fact that 
natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity, thus bidding up the price to 
transmit. Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in 60 
years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market, putting 
even more demands on natural gas generation. Such as the fact that imports 
into the state, which were running 20% and up to 25% during peak usage, have 
declined. And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions 
-- which must be held by plants generating electricity -- has skyrocketed. 
Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years, 
unfettered by rate increases, has zoomed dramatically. 
At any rate, electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country; 
indeed, California's neighbors, the states of Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, 
Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Montana, have had to bump up utility rates 
30% to 50%. So where is the tablet of stone saying that California, with its 
especially restrictive environmental regulations, should be any different? 
The bad news for California is that, poor dears, it can't be different. 
Market fundamentals, like supply and demand, rule. But that's also the good 
news. High wholesale prices (and necessary profits) have done their job; they 
have brought forth a number of suppliers, in the form of more than a dozen 
plans for significant new generating plants; in fact, plans have even been 
announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines. Too, demand has 
started to abate; peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen 4% to 9% from 
last year, doubtless a response to a "temporary" 10% rate hike in January and 
the California Public Utilities Commission's decision in March to finally 
really, really raise rates by as much as 50% on average. (The details of that 
plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this month's 
bills.) 
So California's blame-shifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes 
over. The market is working, and imposing price caps would not only interrupt 
that process, but would be unnecessary. Of course, there is a painful lag 
between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market 
remedies of increased supply and lower demand. And California will probably 
feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and 
blackouts. 
But, in the long run, the market will be successful in creating new supply 
and lower prices. Unfortunately California's energy glut will probably come 
too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery. Ultimately 
we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has 
served them poorly.

Hi Rick,

I don't know.   Steve never did call that afternoon to discuss the leadership 
issue.  (My comment to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a 
leadership role on these issues, but that he needs to step up to the plate.  
This means being able to do Hill meetings on his own, being willing to step 
back and re-evaluate our strategies from time to time, and looking beyond 
Scott for policy and technical guidance).

I'm also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at 
our EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week.  I think I need to talk about 
individual versus group efforts.  The issues circling in my mind at the 
moment are:

People need to realize that individual success does not happen independently 
of the success of our group as a whole.
This means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to 
work constructively will every other individual in our group.  No exceptions.
Decisions about who attends meetings, whether with the FCC, Congressional 
members and staff, or EBS executives will be determined according to  the 
nature and purpose of the meeting.  That means that sometimes I step aside 
for you or Linda or Steve Kean, and that sometimes one person in my group 
steps aside for another.  Individual success in not measured by the meetings 
that you attend.  It's measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda.
 Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they 
are focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative 
impact on their performance reviews.

I really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible.  Please 
let me know if you ever think I'm wasting too much of your time with these 
petty issues.

How's London?  Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications, so 
I'm the only one in Argentina so far.  I had a very good day of meetings with 
our lawyer yesterday.  We've rescheduled meetings with the Argentine 
regulators for Wednesday afternoon, so that Wayne and Zal will be able to 
make them.  This means only one day in Sao Paolo and one day in Brasilia, but 
from all that  I've heard that's not a bad thing.

Talk to you soon.

Sue

Hi Steve,

The reason that I've used "DC Office" is that Linda has indicated that she 
wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allison's assignments.  I'm 
not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it 
works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.  To be 
honest, though, I don't think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean 
that your role is simply administrative.

Are you around at the end of the day today?  I have a meeting from 2:00-4:00, 
but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise.  Thanks,

Sue

Hi Sue:

This may be a function of the Washington office/EBS Government Affairs 
differing reporting relationships, but...

With the "DC office" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like 
these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that 
we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You 
know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is 
important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  
I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable 
and familiar with the issues.

Therefore, two requests.  

Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as "DC Office"?

Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple 
of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM 
issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these 
initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a 
leadership role.

Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just 
between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior 
Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority 
ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and 
maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

Happy as always to discuss.

Muchas gracias,
Steve

We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and 
the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th.

In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing 
efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee "bully pulpit" to 
pressure FERC into more action.  This effort is led by incoming chairman 
Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.  They are saying they 
will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC 
takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.

The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee 
chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).  While this committee does not have the 
legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms 
of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has  broad 
oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including 
FERC.  New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman 
today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.

In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 
featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps 
last month.  We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the 
anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will 
also testify.  We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments 
against price caps and the latest publicly available market data.  On June 20 
the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its 
duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates 
are just and reasonable.  We are going to meet with the committee majority 
staff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses 
(i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis).

We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman 
Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, including 
relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times 
article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert).  There is at present no 
indicationi that either hearing will address this matter.  We are, as you 
might imagine, paying close attention to this situation.

Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write 
to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the 
entire west and to extend it to 24/7.  He also asks FERC to see if it can 
implement "negawatts" demand reduction administratively.  We are in the 
process of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public.

Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking up 
portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the 
month unfolds.

SPAIN AND CALIFORNIA

Please, note that the regulator (CNE, advisory body) has recently declared 
that "the California situation cannot happen in Spain, although it is likely 
that some isolated blackouts may happen in the East coast this summer".


Physical crisis in Spain

To me, it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load 
margins in the Spanish power market have been recently decreasing, and that 
more generation capacity is needed! In fact, REE (Red Electrica de Espana, 
the transmission company and TSO) is relatively worried about shortages of 
capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years (6-8 percent). In 
Spain, no major power plants have been built in the last 20 years. The 
avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced (including 
Enron's Arcos CCGT 1200MW) since 1998 (outset of liberalisation) could cope 
with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation, 
regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed.

Authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that 
bad, and so it is connection to the electricity grid. However, access to gas 
pipelines still remains  as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these 
new gas fired power plants, but mostly, that some of the CCGTs projects (as 
Enron's) get financed (find attached the memo about the Enron's Arcos power 
plant). Pipelines are owned are managed by Enagas, which is 100 percent owned 
by Gas Natural, who controls more than 95% of gas supplies in Spain. 

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Prompt and adequated development of the gas system to make sure new gas 
fired plants are built.
2. For these new CCGTs to get financed, it is necessary that firm and 
continuous access is ensured by Enagas.  


Financial crisis in Spain

The regulator has also said that given the "vertically integrated structure 
of the Spanish power utilities, it is impossible that the California's 
financial crisis happen". This is only partially true because the CTCs buffer 
(stranded costs payments) have mitigated the financial stress of the 
utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs. In reality, what will 
prevent a financial crisis in Spain will be the Government, by increasing 
tariffs if things go nasty.

However, from the Enron perspective, the existence of CTCs is distorting the 
market, both for retailing activities and the development of power projects, 
since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals.


MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts 
of the Spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as 
possible. (By 2003, all customers will be eligible).
2. It is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated 
(distribution) and non-regulated activities (generation and supply), 
facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market, 
and reducing the market share of incumbents.


ITALY AND CALIFORNIA

Similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in Italy as 
those in Spain are equally valid. In addition, please note.

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more 
expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants.
2. It is imperative that the Italian TSO facilitates the localisation of new 
power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the 
transmission system capacity and expansion plans. The TSO must be there to 
help new developers (actually, the Italian TSO is very aware of this and has 
publicly declared to wish to go in this direction).
3. The Italian Power Pool was due for Jan 2001, but its start has being 
delayed, and it is uncertain when it will happen. For new entrants, to have 
the Pool live and running is of special interest to a) increase the 
understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the Italian market and 
b) to increase liquidity. Also, make sure you mention that the Pool should 
help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all 
participants, mostly on its inception phase.  


Please, find attached a short summary of the Arcos situation. The main issue 
here is that Enagas (gas transco monopoly) is trying to grant access to 
transportation and regasfication infrastructures CONDITIONAL to the 
construction of a number of new infrastructures, which are also subject to 
obtaining permits issued by the authorities. Instead, the regulator (CNE) has 
basically imposed Enagas an obligation to build and grant access to Enron on 
a firm and continuous basis, that is, no conditional. The regulator's 
decision is binding but not normative.

***************************************************************
HOLLINGS FAVORS SMALLER COMMERCE COMMITTEE;
INOUYE SET TO RETAKE COMMUNICATIONS GAVEL

It's still too early in the Senate transition game to tell which
issues -- telecom related or not -- will come to a head under a
Democratic-led Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.
But incoming Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.) already has
singled out one item for immediate attention -- downsizing the
Commerce Committee.

The panel gained two seats for a total of 22 at the outset of the
107th Congress.  Under a Senate "power-sharing" pact that went
into effect last January, all the committees were drawn up to
reflect the Senate's 50-50 split between Democrats and
Republicans (TR, Jan. 15).

But with Sen. James Jeffords's (R., Vt.) departure from the GOP
expected to take effect this week, Democrats are pushing a new
reorganization plan that would give them a one-seat advantage on
each committee.  For the Commerce Committee, Sen. Hollings
prefers trimming a Republican from the panel rather than adding a
Democrat, his spokesman said.

"He feels the Commerce Committee is starting to get too large and
plans to work with [incoming Majority Leader Thomas A.] Daschle
[D., S.D.] to come up with a final determination," the spokesman
told TR today.

It is too early to discuss specific Commerce Committee agenda
items for the remainder of the year, the Hollings spokesman said.
But before he begins pushing an agenda, Sen. Hollings will confer
with current Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain (R., Ariz.),
he added.

"While the committee's priorities have yet to be determined, the
style in which they work won't be changing," the spokesman said.
"Clearly, Sens. McCain and Hollings have a long-standing, working
relationship. . .and cover issues that transcend party lines.
They pride themselves on moving things out of that committee in
bipartisan fashion, and that isn't going to change," he added.

On the telecom front, Sen. Hollings is in line to become chairman
of the communications subcommittee, but he's not expected to
assume that post.  Instead, the subcommittee's gavel likely will
return to Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (Hawaii), who last held the top
spot there in 1994.

A Hollings-Inouye pairing would be good news for those who don't
want Congress to overhaul the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
Earlier this year, Sens. Inouye and Hollings were two of four
senators who called on FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell to maintain
the "strict adherence and strong enforcement" of the local
market-opening mandates spelled out in sections 251 and 271 of
the Act (TR, April 30).

Sen. Inouye also has pressed the FCC for quick action on
Northpoint Technologies Ltd.'s applications to operate in the Ku-
band (TR, May 28), and he was an original cosponsor to a bill, S
414, to set up a new telecom program to be administered by the
Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (TR, March 5).

For current communications subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns
(R., Mont.), the loss of the gavel shouldn't disrupt the rollout
of his "tech seven" agenda of telecom and Internet issues, his
spokeswoman said.  "It's still his top priority," she said.  Sen.
Burns "enjoys a good working relationship with [Sen.] Hollings
and feels they'll move the tech seven agenda."


***************************************************************
TECH COALITION BACKS BUSH's CALL
TO EXTEND CHINA's TRADE STATUS

A coalition of groups representing telecom equipment and high-
tech companies today said Congress should extend normal trade
relations (NTR) status with China for another year.  The U.S.
High-Tech Industry Coalition said it "strongly endorsed"
President Bush's call for such an extension.

Extending China's normal trade status would "protect current U.S.
high-tech investments and businesses in China, thus enhancing
opportunities for increased market access once China formally
joins the World Trade Organization," the coalition said.  China
is "moving toward completing" all of its accession procedures for
joining the WTO, it added.

The coalition includes the AeA (formerly the American Electronics
Association), the Computer & Communications Industry Association,
Information Technology Association of America, Information
Technology Industry Council, and the Telecommunications Industry
Association.


***************************************************************
HEALTH RESEARCHERS TO SETTLE LAWSUIT OVER USE OF PRIVATE
CELLPHONE RECORDS

The group that led a six-year, $27 million industry-funded effort
to study the health effects of mobile phones has agreed to settle
a class-action lawsuit.  The suit was filed in 1995 on behalf of
mobile phone users who claimed their privacy was invaded.  Their
phone records were reviewed without their permission as part of
the research project, the plaintiffs said.

Wireless Technology Research LLC has agreed to turn over the
remaining $1.4 million of a $2 million insurance policy that the
wireless industry purchased for it in the wake of the litigation.
As part of the settlement agreement, $250,000 of those funds will
be set aside to fund a voluntary, surveillance registry to assess
whether there is a link between mobile phone use and illnesses.

The registry will be run by WTR Chairman George L. Carlo, who had
a falling out with the wireless industry after he accused it of
failing to act on research that he said indicated a link between
mobile phone use and adverse health effects.  The settlement also
reserves $150,000 for future legal expenses of Mr. Carlo and WTR.

In addition, mobile phone subscribers included in the class would
get a 50% discount on a book Mr. Carlo co-authored last year,
"Cell Phones: Invisible Hazards in the Wireless Age."

Attorneys for the plaintiffs in "Jerald P. Busse et al. v.
Motorola, Inc. et al." (case no. 95 CH 10332) have asked the Cook
County, Ill., Circuit Court to hold a hearing Thursday on the
proposed settlement.  If the court approves the agreement, WTR
would be dropped from the lawsuit, but other defendants from the
wireless industry would remain.

An aide for Mr. Carlo told TR today he couldn't discuss the
settlement until it is finalized.  Michael F. Altschul, senior
vice president-policy and administration and general counsel for
the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association, which is
a defendant in the case, also declined to comment, saying
industry attorneys were reviewing the proposed settlement.

CLEC ASKS FCC TO STAY RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION ORDER

Competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) Core Communications,
Inc. (CoreTel) has asked the FCC to stay the effectiveness of a
recent order overhauling reciprocal compensation rules.  The new
rules are designed to phase out payments received by carriers for
connecting calls to Internet service providers (ISPs).  CoreTel
said the order could force it to abandon some of its markets.

CoreTel took issue with two provisions of the order in Common
Carrier dockets 96-98 and 99-68 (TR, April 23).  One is the ban
on carriers' receiving reciprocal compensation for terminating
calls to ISPs in any new markets entered after the adoption of
the order.  The other is the "growth cap" provision, which limits
annual increases in a carrier's reciprocal compensation revenue.

The order allows CLECs that already are operating in a particular
geographic area to continue receiving reciprocal compensation
revenues up to the limit set by the growth cap, while hampering
new CLECs, CoreTel noted.  That situation puts new CLECs entering
those markets at an "extreme competitive disadvantage," it said.

"The business that CoreTel will lose as a result of these new
rules and the competitive advantage they confer on established
CLECs is incalculable and irremediable at some later date,"
CoreTel said.  It will suffer "irreparable harm" if the
provisions aren't stayed pending judicial review, the company
added.

Publisher's Note
================
The EU Member States may disagree about exactly when they will able
to let in the new members from Eastern and Central Europe. But
preparations for their accession continue apace.

The EU's Council of Ministers this week gave the Commission the go-
ahead to negotiate 'framework agreements' with Cyprus, Malta and
Turkey for their early participation in programmes such as the EU's
R&D Programme and education and vocational training programmes. They
will also be able to take part in all the programmes already open to
the candidate countries of central/eastern Europe.

Early participation in EU programmes forms an important part of a pre-
accession strategy already used for central and eastern European
candidates. It provides useful preparation for accession by
familiarising the candidate countries and their citizens with Union
policies and working methods.

1. Agreement reached over EU takeover directive
-----------------------------------------------
The EU has finally agreed the contents of the Takeover Directive
after 12 years of negotiation. The Conciliation deal between the
European Parliament and the Council would force company boards to
inform minority shareholders and workers of their recommendations on
a takeover offer at the same time as the majority shareholders.
Governments would have until 2005 to pass the legislation but with an
extra year's grace to pass a ban on 'poison pill' defences.

2. Irish vote on EU Treaty referendum
-------------------------------------
On Thursday, Ireland became the first and only country to ask its
people to vote on proposals to enlarge the EU. The result of the
referendum on whether to ratify the Nice Treaty was expected by late
afternoon on Friday.

3. EIB signals greater focus on Eastern Europe, research
--------------------------------------------------------
The European Investment Bank, at its annual meeting in Luxembourg,
signalled the Bank's aim of limiting growth of its lending within the
EU member countries in order to give more room for activities in the
candidate countries. The Bank has also called for a capital increase
in 2003.
Full story: http://www.eubusiness.com/item/49087
The EIB and the Commission this week also signed a memorandum for
closer co-operation in the funding of European research.

4. EU warns Germany over gas liberalisation
-------------------------------------------
The Commission has sent a written warning to Germany for failing to

directive by August 10 last year.
Full story: http://www.eubusiness.com/item/48959


5. Turkey mulls adopting euro before EU membership: report
----------------------------------------------------------
Turkey could adopt the euro unilaterally before joining the EU,
Economy Minister Kemal Dervis was quoted as saying by the Financial
Times on Monday. Dervis said the move would be possible in five years
if Turkey managed to achieve low inflation - currently at 60 per
cent - and fulfilled other EU membership criteria, the paper said.

'How can these people talk "making the EU the most competitive

tax co-ordination would help countries meet these objectives"... are
these not effectively the same people who, for example, ever campaign
to extend the same work practices that restrict the rights of
employers (and willing employees) to demand longer working hours etc.
etc ... or have I completely missed the boat here perhaps? Tweaking
tax and cross border issues alone will not bring make this commercial
dream happen ... We compete with completely deregulated markets ...
rather big ones I fear, we lack dynamism, freedom and choice ... "

Mr. Shapiro,

I would like an opportunity to gain practical experience in the Governmental 
Affairs group you are heading up for Enron.  My background at Enron has lead 
me through two emerging companies, Azurix and Enron Broadband Services, both 
of which faced and are facing regulatory and legislative issues.  Currently, 
I am rotating through the Analyst/Associate program in business development 
roles, but have a strong desire to work for a group that helps shape our 
commercial deals.  I have been speaking with both Rocky Storie and Allison 
Navin about this area of Enron and I would appreciate it if I could meet with 
someone from your team in the Houston office.  

Attached is a copy of my resume.  I am in the process of looking for my next 
rotation towards the end of this summer and would like to know if there are 
any opportunities within your group.




Regards,

Melanie King

Hello All -- Just and update on the Chicago Deal.  
 The ordinance which would permit the City to enter into a multi-year 
agreement was introduced in the City Council yesterday and the Mayor held a 
post-Council press conference with our deal being the first issue addressed 
(and the only one to have a nice graphic showing its benefits).  Several 
high-profile issues were also on the agenda (racial profiling, redistricting, 
legal representations for aldermen re: school locations, school board CEO 
Paul Vallas' future, Gery Chico's replacement, etc.) so the press spent 
several minutes questioning both the Mayor and City Commissioner Bill Abolt 
on our issue.  Abolt did a masterful job of handling the issue with his point 
being that the City has lived up to its commitment to 1) develop a 
competitive market, 2) reduce costs while, 3) promoting green power 
(renewables).  The press focused on whether ComEd was resentful that 60% of 
the City's requirements will be covered by this agreement to which Mr. Dwyer, 
of ComEd, after the press conference stated that they viewed the deal as a 
win because ComEd got the green component of the City's business.  Peggy 
Mahoney also made a post conference statement and was welcomed by the press 
and was given a favorable treatment by the press (Dick Kay, Andy Shaw and 
Mike Flannery).  
 On balance, I think that the press did not know what to make of this deal 
but knew that this is an appropriate response to the drubbing the Mayor has 
received in the past for putting all of the City's energy needs in one basket 
laid at the feet of ComEd.  As you know, this is only the introduction of our 
deal to the City Council and it has not been approved yet.  We expect that 
that will occur either later in June or certainly by the end of July.  The 
actual contract will be finalized and signed at that time.  In the mean time, 
I expect that the press will have more questions as this matter moves forward 
and it goes to the Council's Energy Committee.  The City is doing the heavy 
lifting and it is best that Enron not take an over large profile -- but we 
also cannot become invisible either.  Julie Starsiak of Ronan & Potts and 
Peggy Mahoney are very much involved.

City Council meeting tomorrow.  As you know, the actual Agreement will be
finalized 24 hours prior to execution.

Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise 
the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is

- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory 
Authority)

I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past 
re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on 
the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he 
could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of 
a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, 
nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the 
pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, 
see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at 
last week of August, for 1/2 days. 

I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation 
who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.


Alfredo,
I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month
of August.
The aspects I'm considering are:
- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,
- the operation of hubs,
- the balancing penalties,
- the trading of capacity
- the general operation of a (big) pipeline
- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC
- the operation of a shipper
Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your
american colleagues on any of these items.
---
In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in 
Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines 
and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the 
relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the 
access practice).
A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, 
Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be 
arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could 
refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of 
transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the 
infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory 
authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration.
I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would 
be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations 
and to discuss with experts would be all right. 
In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch 
with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good 
general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when 
I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and 
balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, 
there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit.
Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me.
As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with 
september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano).
Thank you and best regards
Mauro


Dear Alfredo,
I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte
on TPA practice, there.
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit
at a major pipeline.
Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible
example for me?
I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and
balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major
aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting
pipelines) for transmission and storage.
I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent
of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.
Thank you and best regards
Mauro

E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy and
public utility law.

JULY 19, 2001



U.S. Energy Regulators Restructure The
Transmission Grid, Call for Four
Regional Transmission Organizations

Jonathan W. Gottlieb, Esq.
Roger M. Gibian, Esq.

On July 12th, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a series
of orders that fundamentally restructures the transmission system in the
United States. In its orders FERC called for the development of one Regional
Transmission Organization for each of the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and
Western regions of the country.  An immediate result of these actions is
that FERC directed:  (1) the New York ISO, NEPOOL, PJM, and PJM-West into
mediation proceedings for the formation of a single RTO covering the
Northeast United States from Maryland and West Virginia north to Maine; and
(2) the Southern Companies, Southwest Power Pool, Entergy, and GridSouth
into mediation proceedings for the formation of a single RTO in the
Southeast.  The Commission allowed Southwest Power Pool the option of
instead pursuing involvement in an RTO in the Midwest, and encouraged, but
did not require, the entities comprising the GridFlorida RTO to engage in
the Southeast RTO mediation proceedings.

These orders reflect the ascendancy of a coalition of Commissioners Massey,
Wood, and Brownell, and represent a fundamental shift in FERC's RTO
formation policy.  FERC has sent a clear signal that it is shifting away
from its pattern of supporting maintenance of the status quo and towards a
more actively engaged posture to shape the Nation's energy policy.  These
orders reflect the apparent frustration being felt by many at FERC and the
fact that the agency has clearly run out of patience with the slow pace of
the voluntary RTO formation process.  In a surprising twist, in its orders
the Commission openly expresses its disappointment with the lack of progress
being made in various existing RTO proceedings.  Given the dismissive tone
and far-reaching scope of these orders, it seems safe to assume that FERC
will not hesitate to terminate collaborative processes it perceives to be
unproductive, and will take the extraordinary step of directing parties into
time-limited settlement discussions with the threat of Commission action if
the parties do not work their problems out on their own.  By forcefully
asserting its control over the process and altering the configuration of
RTOs at this late stage in their development, the Commission is showing that
it will aggressively pursue its goal of having large-scale region-wide RTOs
operational by its December 15, 2001 target date.

With the recent addition over the past several months of new Commissioners
Wood and Brownell,  FERC now possesses a reinvigorated political will to
take more aggressive action to ensure the implementation of its regulatory
policy agenda.  Commissioner Wood, a close friend of President Bush and
widely expected to replace Chairman Hebert following the August recess, has
been pursuing an active agenda since arriving at the Commission earlier this
year.  Although recently rebuffed in his efforts to establish numerous new
rulemaking dockets (due to lack of available staff support), Commissioner
Wood's separate concurring statements that renewable resources are an
increasingly important part of the nation's energy mix, that congestion
management must be addressed in a standard format nationally, and that the
$5,000 annual membership fee for voting members of PJM prevents reasonable
inclusion of individual residential and small customers, indicate that a
Commission led by a Chairman Wood would be receptive to creative and
innovative proposals as well as aggressive in its pursuit of the
organizational structure it believes best for competitive markets.

In its orders on July 12th, the Commission indicated its receptiveness
towards adopting standardized generation interconnection agreements and
standardized procedures for the conversion of interconnection agreements,
while Commissioner Wood expressed additional support for the adoption of a
national standardized congestion management scheme and the development of
uniform reliability and market interface practices.  Adopting standardized
procedures in these areas will produce two significant benefits:  (1) it
will promote generation investment and market stability; and (2) it would
promote the efficient use of FERC staff resources, as staff would no longer
be required to process the significant number of filings and pleadings it
presently receives in connection with these issues.  This latter point is
especially important, given that Commissioner Wood has been frustrated in
his attempts to initiate new rulemaking procedures and promote a more active
agenda due to a lack of available staff resources.  Given Commissioner
Massey's explicit mention of the "crushing workload" that staff has been
under and Commissioner Wood's incentive for freeing up staff resources, FERC
should be taking significant steps in the future towards the standardization
of a wide variety of procedures.

Establishing four region-wide RTOs will increase the availability of power
supplies, reduce problems in sending electricity between control areas, and
create a more liquid national electricity market.  Placing large portions of
the Nation's transmission grid under the control of a single operator will
help eliminate transmission constraints, increase reliability, and lower
wholesale prices.  Given the Commission's disposition towards establishing
these large-scale RTOs, it appears inevitable that the Commission will
direct parties in the Midwest and Western regions into mediation proceedings
similar to those convened for the Northeast and Southeast.  Orders
initiating those proceedings will probably be issued after the Southeast and
Northeast proceedings have concluded.

Rick: Here's the "draft" Eurelectric report (never saw final, but don't think 
it's materially different.) 

Would be good if whoever is updating Jim Steffes slides from 29/3 could take 
a steer from the issues the report concentrates on, and either endorse/ 
explain them, or rebut/ disentangle them. Also we should bear in mind theme 
of Madrid conferenc is convergence of power and gas markets/ regulation, so 
gas market aspects for Western Area will be of partic. interest. Items to 
de-emphasise in very short slot available may be workings of PX and NOx 
credits trading. 

For potential lessons of relevance to Europe, I think Steve should 
concentrate on dangers in: decoupling of wholesale and retail market, 
attempted upfront guaranteed benefits to smaller consumers, and absence of 
adequate demand side, and generation investment, signals.

Alfredo, Teun, Paul and Paul: As mentioned in staff meeting yesterday, would 
appreciate your one or two slides each of bullet points on lessons for/ 
reassurance of irrelevance to (as the case may be!) your markets by end this 
week. Steve is away, so Rick and I will take a look at pulling this together 
intitially.

Maureen,

I've checked Linda Robertson's call sheet from January 2001 and do not find 
any record of incoming calls from Commissioner Hebert to Linda.
Nonetheless, she may have initiated a call TO him.

I'ved tried to reach Linda on her cell phone -- no success.  Perhaps Rick 
could raise this question with Linda when he joins her on the 11:00 AM (CDT) 
conference call today?

I'm also checking with Sarah Novosel and Joe Hartsoe -- both of whom are out 
at meetings at the present time.  When I get any responses I'll let you know.
Thanks for holding down the fort!

Lora

Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to 
become a power, and fiscal, crisis
By Pete Wilson 
(Published June 3, 2001) 

The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of 
hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a 
sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when 
deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature 
(and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer, 
including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply 
over demand amounting to some 30 percent. 
Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive 
down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and, 
second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new 
generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and 
keep in California all the jobs that it would produce. 
And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in 
applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of 
the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of 
Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage 
of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date 
(March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of 
Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for 
1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone. 

Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California 
Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy 
shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers 
to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that 
promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply. 
That's why I signed it. 
I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 -- 
just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which, 
though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the 
status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation. 
No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less 
hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity 
demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity 
surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power 
blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction 
allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to 
become a state fiscal crisis. 
Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, "If I wanted to raise rates, I 
could have solved this problem in 20 minutes." Sadly, by temporizing on 
needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he 
made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two 
downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state 
spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has 
been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state 
budget. 
The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in 
electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which 
gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or 
the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in 
recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting 
agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century. 
It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible 
energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot 
reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a 
political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem. 
Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could 
have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of 
California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including 
explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers 
include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I 
used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los 
Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead 
of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required 
by law. 
Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the 
Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned 
utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at 
the time of enactment. 
He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the 
utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers. 
He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish 
process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early 
enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so 
not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly 
accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow 
us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and 
economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither 
reliable nor affordable. 
All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier: 
A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to 
prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it. 
Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the 
threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full 
range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could 
have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become. 
We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast 
enough to avoid blackouts this summer. 
PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern 
California Edison would not be teetering on the brink. 
Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels. 
The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars. 
And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from 
other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California 
employers to their states and steal our jobs. 
The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will 
provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it 
does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to 
mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's 
present crisis. 
The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government 
cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's 
responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create 
a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers 
to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have 
cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that 
incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest. 
The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of 
Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the 
matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the 
governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just 
as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition 
39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election. 
Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him 
then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and 
a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in 
order to shift the blame for his own inaction. 

Pete Wilson is the former governor of California.

Seabron --

As the first installment of what we discussed earlier, I would like to 
request that you put together a short piece that we could incorporated into 
Enron's response to the FERC's June 19 Order (due on July 19 so we need it 
maybe by July 15).

Basically what we would like to do is to highlight the problems with the 
FERC's decision to implicitly use cost-of-service going forward.  We want to 
make sure that the FERC understands that less liquidity in the cash market 
has (a) reliability and (b) economic impacts for consumers.  This is should 
not be a statement that marketers are hurt, but rather focus on how the 
market is harmed.   We would like to show the FERC how the order drives 
marketers out of the real time market and the negative impact this will have 
on the real time and forward markets.  Highlight the 

The approved budget is $25,000.

Can you do this?

Also, I got your message and had heard about the Power Marketers group 
looking to put on testimony.  Not sure exactly what they are looking to do, 
but will discuss with counsel to make sure that everything is ok.

Jim

All

I talked to the Trustee late Friday. They are reluctant and not intending to 
meet with anyone. The want to keep their independence although they did say 
that at this point the process has been one sided. They are, however, very 
interested in getting as much information as possible for us and others. We 
should provide them copies of all the letters that we have sent to the MTF, 
EdF,  and PWC as they have not received any of that information as of yet. 
With that we should include a cover note and points on the PIM that we have 
not covered. 

When questioned on what their role was, they explained that it was to monitor 
the execution of EdF's responsibilities, set up the auction process and 
perform the auction. They must insure that the product offered by EDF is 
reasonably coherent with the conditions agreed to with the MTF, and finally 
they must insure transparency.

On the possibilities to changes certain terms conditions in the decision. 
Their role is to ensure that the remedy as agreed is followed through (they 
have no power to ensure that the greater purpose of the remedy - i.e. promote 
competition is fulfilled). Thus any fundamental changes on conditions that 
were precisely stated in the remedy (i.e. noon notification and price level - 
stated in the confidential version of the decision) will unlikely be changed, 
on these issues we can give it a go, but I see very little probability for 
success. Other issues that have not been well defined such as the schedule, 
type of  auction (SMP vs PAB) could possibly be influenced.

Let's send before meeting with the Trustee a letter similar to EdF and PWC  
letters, but incorporating comments on the PIM.

Let's prepare a draft tomorrow, that we will circulate within the group.

Lobbyists Gain the Edge
In persuading President Bush, a self-proclaimed free trader, to take steps 
this week aimed at restricting imports of steel, lobbyists for the U.S. steel 
industry used the threat that thousands of retired steelworkers in key states 
would lose their health insurance if their companies closed.

The specter of an uprising by steel retirees, who substantially outnumber 
active steelworkers, provided a potent political argument for the industry's 
case that Bush should take drastic action to protect U.S. steel companies 
from a worldwide glut even at the cost of tarnishing his free-trade image.

The argument was advanced by two top Republican lobbyists, Edward W. 
Gillespie and Vin Weber, each of whom has been receiving $45,0!
00!
a month from an industry-union coalition called Stand Up for Steel.

The coalition scored a smashing victory Tuesday, when Bush announced that his 
administration will file a case with the U.S. International Trade Commission 
seeking to win authority to set quotas on steel imports. And although many 
factors went into the White House's decision, industry sources and other 
participants pointed to the concerns raised by Gillespie and Weber as a 
classic demonstration of how a highly motivated constituency can sway an 
administration that barely won the electoral college and lost the popular 
vote.

"From a political perspective, this was not a hard case to make to a 
government as closely divided as this one is," said Weber, a former 
congressman, in an interview. Eighteen steel companies are "in one stage or 
another of bankruptcy. All those retirees are facing loss of benefits."

Only about 150,000 people now work in U.S. steel facilities, but at some of 
the biggest integrated steel!
ma!
kers -- which are in the worst trouble financially -- there are about six 
retirees for every active worker. (The total number of retirees is slightly 
more than 300,000, according to industry officials).

Adding to the political punch behind the Gillespie-Weber argument was the 
fact that many of these retirees live in Rust Belt states that were hotly 
contested in the last presidential election, including Pennsylvania, 
Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia. The most fiercely contested state of all -- 
Florida -- is among the top eight states  in number of retirees.

A lobbyist who worked against the steel industry, Lewis Leibowitz of the law 
firm Hogan & Hartson, ruefully gave credit to his opponents' political skill. 
Leibowitz represents the Consumer Industry Trade Action Coalition, which 
consists of companies that favor free trade on the grounds that import 
competition helps keep costs low.

"They did a lot, obviously," Leibowitz said, referring to Gillespie and 
Weber. "This is an!
i!
ndustry that has something like 160,000 workers, and the market [value] of 
all the companies is smaller than that of Amazon.com, and they've turned this 
town upside down. So my hat is off to them."

The administration took other considerations into account, to be sure, 
including the need to win support from steel state Democrats for 
congressional authority to negotiate new trade agreements.

Jim Dyke, a spokesman for Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, asserted that 
his boss was particularly moved by the pleas of union leaders who recalled 
how their companies had shed workers and restructured in the 1980s only to 
find themselves devastated anew by imports. Foreign steel shipments, which 
account for about 20 percent of the U.S. market, reached record levels after 
financial crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil in the late 1990s.

"Factories are closing, and people are losing their jobs, because there's not 
a level playing field," Dyke said, repeating the administration's argument!
t!
hat a major reason for the oversupply of steel on world markets is the 
subsidies that many foreign countries provided when they established their 
national industries. "This fits in with the president's free-trade strategy."

Capitalizing on the administration's decision, Evans joined in a news 
conference/rally yesterday with such top labor leaders as John Sweeney, 
president of the AFL-CIO, and Leo Gerard, president of the United 
Steelworkers of America, both of whom backed Democrat Al Gore in the 2000 
presidential race.

"You can trust that we will be with you every step of the way until the 
problem is fixed," Evans told the cheering crowd, which was reminded by other 
speakers that the Clinton administration had balked at filing a case like the 
one Bush intends to bring before the International Trade Commission. (The 
Clinton administration, along with a number of industry lawyers, feared 
losing the case at the time, but industry experts said another factor was the 
staunch fr!
ee!
-trade stance of the Treasury Department.)

The Bush administration itself has balked at taking action that would 
directly protect the benefits of steel retirees. The steelworkers union has 
called for the government to create a fund that would help cover these  
"legacy costs," but administration officials said their moves to block 
imports should help protect benefits by aiding the industry's revival.

The White House will now have to contend with the ire of U.S. trading 
partners, which have reacted with a mixture of indignation and restraint. 
Long Tong Yu, China's top trade official, told a news conference at a trade 
meeting in Zhouzhuang yesterday that although "China is concerned with any 
protectionist practices or measures,"  it would wait to see whether the U.S. 
action conformed with the rules of the World Trade Organization.

Akira Chihaya, president of Nippon Steel Corp. and the head of Japan's Iron 
and Steel Federation, lashed out at the United States, saying he fears!
t!
he administration's move "will encourage protectionism, which has been 
spreading globally."

But U.S. steel industry sources were crowing over the importance of a 
professed free-trade president putting his imprimatur on an ambitious 
initiative to save the industry. "He must be choking, but he wants to win 
elections," one industry official said.

He has started work. Basic scope of two papers is already identified. I 
scheduled meetings for him all day in London on Monday with colleagues 
covering various EU countries, including Paul and Paul. I have tentatively 
arranged to see him again myself in Brussels or Amsterdam on 1 June, but we 
could try to postpone that to 6 June. I am not personally convinced that, 
with Michael Brown intending a blitz on consultants, Littlechild is 
particularly good value for money - a potentially potent missile, but clumsy 
to target! We can terminate him as from end August. 

I will call you about your schedule of visits/ itinerary.

Dear Mark
 
We had a brief but helpful meeting on 7 February,  since when I have 
discussed and signed a contract with Annette Patrick. I was  hoping to begin 
work before now, but two lengthy trips abroad have precluded  this. I thought 
it would be helpful to recap where we now are and what I have in  mind.
 
You summarised the three topics where further work  would be helpful to you as
1. What went wrong in California? (and why it  should not preclude further 
liberalisation in Europe)
2. The importance of accelerated EU directives,  including the importance of 
separation of functions.
3. The importance of retail marketing, including to  residential customers.
 
On the first topic, I have recently published a  paper in the Journal of 
Applied Corporate Finance, Winter 2001 edition (which  incidentally features 
Enron in a couple of the other articles). Copy attached.  Most of it is 
familiar stuff but there is a concluding section on California  which answers 
the What went wrong question. We could aim to bring this to a  wider 
audience, but there are lots of papers on this topic now, and the  situation 
changes almost daily, so it may be better to incorporate it into a  paper on 
Europe.
 
On the second topic, I accepted an invitation to  address an analysts' 
conference (UBS Warburg) this coming Monday, on the topic  of regulatory 
policy in Europe and where it is going. I knew nothing about the  topic at 
the time, but thought it would force me to learn.  Unfortunately  there has 
been little time to do this so far. The topic ties in with the work we  
discussed, and if acceptable to you I propose to spend the next couple of 
days  working on it under the contract, with a view not just to the 
presentation, but  to a  subsequent paper and publication. I should say that 
the conference  pays a fee, but only enough to cover travel and conference 
time and the  presentation itself, not any underlying research time. 
 
I see from press reports that there has been some  development or lack of it 
with respect to discussions on the EU directive.  I  hope to talk to Kyran on 
this and related topics, either today or tomorrow, and  maybe he has 
something that he can email me. Perhaps next week we can talk about  how to 
take this work forward, and where to aim at - either a journal like  PowerUK, 
or as a direct input into some EU process.
 
On the third topic, my ideas are embodied in the  paper on Joskow that you 
have seen.The question is how best to publicise and  apply these ideas - 
perhaps in a paper on Europe again? That is, to argue for  the importance of 
the directives in a particular respect, namely retail  competition, and to 
show how California failed to do this  adequately?
 
On now to European regulation.
Best wishes
Stephen

Charles --

I would recommend that Jose Bestard be the named person unless there will be 
a number of meetings in the very near term.  It is my understanding that Jose 
will be returning to the US and will take this issue on as the lead no later 
than August 01.  If any of this is incorrect, I should be named.

Finally, does a VP cover the need for "executive"?  Jose and I are both VPs.  
Do we need a higher level - say MD?

Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the 
committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses 
conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.  
The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and Means, 
Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.  Thus, the 
House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August 
Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen 
Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity 
issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he 
chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all electricity issues 
other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly held out hope of 
marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee 
do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate side, the majority 
staff is working on an electricity "white paper" that may be circulated for 
comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1. Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and 
John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) 
that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially 
ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2. First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan basis 
(with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation 
added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available 
power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had 
pursued in subcommittee on the old "Californa Only" bill.)

3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural 
Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas "transportation facility" shall 
not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has 
abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some instances of "old" 
pipelines being considered as "historic places" under federal law.  The House 
Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday.

4. By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the 
president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down 
to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and 
Democrats to this amendment.

5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to 
set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and 
authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 
percent).

Rick:

I have a large set of comments on the full paper from Christi Nicollay (who
has been corrdinating this), plus the others. We will make changes as
appropriate. Sabine and I have also started a bit on the shorter version
just so we will be ready ont hat front.

At some point I guess we still need to have the conversation with Steve
(Maureen is trying to get a new date). From my perspective it would also be
useful if you and I could have a quick chat sometime. Otherwise I think we
risk losing the plot due to the elapsed time.

I will be in Toronto and DC for much of the week but you can try me on my
cellphone number (617) 513-5904.

Here's an attempt at some key "lessons" from CA to the UK (or vice versa as 
the case may be).  Actually they are more themes/differences/comments coming 
out of the CA experience, which will need tailoring/trimming down to fit the 
context of the actual presentation.  As I've indicated, depending on the 
point being presented, there may be a need for some caution in using the 
examples in too simplistic a context.

? Barriers to generator entry.
? Apart from the moratorium, it has been relatively easy to gain consent to 
construct new generation in the UK.  This is clearly a good thing in itself, 
but there are some potential pitfalls in just asserting this.  The entry has 
been criticised as unecessary in a market with significant overcapacity 
(indeed this was one of the justifications for the moratorium) and had 
surprisingly little impact on price for at least the first 8 years of the 
Pool. Indeed prices only fell once NP/PG divested plant.  Hence it would be 
easy to retort that new capacity was not required in the UK, the entry that 
did occur was wasteful and that the CA analogy is bogus (although clearly the 
full story is more complex than this)
? Moratorium had a significant impact on investment and stalled competition.  
(True, but difficult to sustain given that divestment and pre-committed new 
entry ensured that prices fell significantly before the moratorium was 
lifted.)
? Danger that measures designed to meet the CHP and Renewables targets 
constrain future developments and lead to capacity shortages, ie, perfection 
should not be the enemy of the good.  This is not the case currently.  
However, new applications must demonstrate that CHP has been fully explored - 
if this hurdle acquires real teeth (or turns into something more formal) then 
we could see easy consents getting significantly more difficult.  This is, 
however, largely speculation at the current time.

? Retail caps
? Purchase costs could be passed through in UK (for at least the first 8 
years).  Although some purchase costs were pseudo-regulated (through the 
vesting contracts and their replacements),  the Public Electricity Suppliers 
also purchased power from CCGTs in which they also took equity at very high 
prices.  (Teesside was one of the first examples of this.) The cost of this 
was passed through to franchise customers.  This was widely criticised and 
although the regulator allowed this to happen (on the grounds of entry 
promoting competition), the fact that all the entry was baseload and NP/PG 
still controlled the marginal plant meant that wholesale market prices didn't 
change at all.
? Since 1998, prices caps have been instituted and have not been a problem.  
Although the caps squeezed the PES margins, they could contract forward to 
hedge the risk of wholesale price movements.  Morever, the price caps have 
actually reduce wholelsale prices - generator market power meant that the 
wholesale price was, in part, a net-back from the allowed retail tariff.
? Watch out for Independent Energy, a supplier who did go bankrupt.  This was 
due to a combination of being under-hedged when power prices rose and not 
having adequate infrastructure to bill customers and get the cash in.

? Competition
? Generator concentration meant excessive prices for the first 8-9 years of 
the Pool.  Restructuring and divestment was essential to realising the 
benefits of competition.
? Retail competition has been very successful and has been a key driver in 
increasing liquidity in the wholesale market


? Stranded Costs
? Stranded cost recovery largely didn't distort the market, eg, nuclear levy, 
vesting contracts did not affect marginal decisions.  (That said market power 
provided a very soft landing and the market was clearly stitched up to meet 
the needs of the miners for years.)

Hope these help.  Please let me know if you need anything further.

Cheers,

Paul

the market has fallen and is still falling precipitously.  for example, power 
for tomorrow is trading for about $70/MWh on peak and $25/MWh off-peak.  
implementing price caps now would actually be harmful.  peaking units make no 
money.  we are likely to return to a more normal market, particularly after 
the summer, if we aren't there already.  with the forward curve crashing the 
way it is and price caps it makes no sense to build peakers.  what are the 
odds of a balance of the year price cap?

Tim --

What are your current thoughts on wholesale hard price caps for the entire 
West?  

First, the politics are clearly moving toward some compromise with the 
Democrat takeover in the Senate and the "at-risk" Republicans in the House 
(California delegation).  I think that the Administration is struggling for 
some "solution".

Second, given FERC's order, it appears that for many hours caps are already 
in place.

Third, with market prices moving lower, this may want be a non-event.

Finally, I would think that a region-wide solution is simple to understand 
and administer.

Please let me know your thoughts.  I don't know that Enron would ever 
publically endorse such a proposal, but we may signal that we aren't opposed?

Jim

This is an update of the Email below.  With respect to DOE efforts to draft 
electricity legislation, a list of potential items for the bill are being 
discussed this afternoon with Secretary Abraham.  DOE hopes to have a draft 
bill submitted to the White House by Friday, June 15, for consideration by 
the VP Task Force.   Similar to efforts other private sector parties are 
undoubtedly taking, I would like to submit to DOE our suggestions for the 
legislation.  As mentioned below, this bill will not include open access, but 
there are issues related to access which we may want to submit to DOE such as 
how to deal with non-jurisdictional entities.  Other topics on which we may 
want to submit legislative language are PUHCA (the reporting requirements), 
interconnection, reliability, negawatts, RTO ownership issues, and eminent 
domain.  DOE seem very willing to deal with the non-jurisdictional entities, 
either in the rulemaking context or by legislation.  Tom Briggs will be 
following up with appropriate folks on this project.   If you have any other 
ideas for this effort, please let us know ASAP.

(Please do not circulate or discuss the information on this Email outside the 
parties listed here.)

Debate within the Administration on implementation of its energy plan appears 
to be settled.  This debate was prolonged because of change in control of the 
Senate.  The Administration has decided to transmit to Congress by mid-June a 
comprehensive letter containing an inventory of energy plan recommendations 
requiring legislative action.  I understand that legislative language will 
not be transmitted in connection with this letter.  Soon after receipt of the 
letter, the President will host a meeting at the White House of bipartisan 
congressional leaders and some key committee chairs and ranking Members.  The 
purpose of the meeting will be to convey to Congress the imperative of acting 
quickly on the President's plan and it will serve as an official launch of 
the legislative effort and the Administration's efforts to work with Congress 
on the plan.

In the meantime, the Departments and Agencies are already drafting parts of 
the energy plan.  For example, we have been told by DOE that they are 
presently drafting an electric restructuring bill.   I have calls into DOE to 
find out more about their efforts and the specific provisions to be included 
in such legislation.  We have learned that "open access" will not be in this 
legislation, as the President's report instructs FERC to undertake the 
project.  Thus, the Administration continues to believe that legislation is 
not needed for the core open access provisions and that this is a matter they 
understand will be at the top of Pat Wood's agenda.  Among other items, one 
question we will probe with DOE is whether the electricity legislation will 
contain access provisions pertaining to entities presently outside FERC's 
jurisdiction.  

At present, it does not appear that the various provisions being drafted by 
the agencies will be bundled into single transmission from the Administration 
to the Hill.  Instead, the VP's task force intends to have these legislative 
drafts ready to provide relevant committees at the appropriate time.  This 
part of the implementation plan, of course, could change.

As for Pat Wood, we continue to receive confirmation from Hill and Executive 
Branch sources that the White House intends to designate Mr. Wood as FERC 
Chair.   Timing of the switch remains unclear.  Our latest information 
suggests it could be September 1.  Many parties are suggesting to the White 
House that the change should take place earlier than that date.  

We have efforts underway to structure our position on a possible open access 
rulemaking.  A few folks on this email will be talking with Dan Watkiss today 
about such a proposal.

 I have attached the following: a) a high level outline of the speaking 
points for Ken Lay and John Lavorato for their meetings with Premier Harris 
and, I hope, Wilson, Purchase and Hubert;  and  b) a more detailed briefing 
note which outlines:   i) key developments since April 4 ,   ii) our position 
re market opening and the key issues that have been raised against opening 
the market this Fall, iii) differences between California and Ontario; and 
iv) Enron's assessment of the possible difficulties in NYC this Summer.  I am 
awaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on 
NYC.                         One piece that I think needs to be added to the 
detailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position 
in Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of 
pursuing a retail initiative.  You will see where I have left space for that 
piece, hoping that you could draft it.                     I have endeavoured 
in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key 
issues/concerns for  the government are at this stage.                      I 
have asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package.                 
       I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of 
the meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et 
al)  is: a)  to make  the  case for proceeding with market opening this Fall 
if the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive;  b) to provide 
Harris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly 
New York and California) about which the government may have continuing 
concerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward 
to a market opening this year.                              Rick Shapiro left 
me a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit 
and the supporting material. The agreement  between the two of them is 
evidently  that  Rob, you and I are  all to be comfortable with the briefing 
material before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any 
changes he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken 
Lay.                                 I would appreciate your questions, 
comments and suggested revisions.

The Corporate Marketing team along with members of other BU's will be holding 
a mid year off-site on Aug 3. The objectives are to enhance their marketing 
knowledge, refine our strategy, learn more about the resources that exist 
within Enron, and discuss ways in which we can add greater value to the 
business.

Our off-site will be held at the Woodlands Conference Center, and I would 
like to invite you to speak to about (20 to 25 people) for a half an hour on 
Friday morning. I know you live close by, so I hope this won't be an 
inconvience. Since our department fosters entrepreneurial thinking and seeks 
to learn more about new initiatives within Enron, all would benefit from 
hearing from you specifically about the following: The objectives for 
government and regulatory affairs domestically; how California may have 
disrupted Enron's plans; key objectives that need to be achieved, the 
strategies you are employing; and the role that marketing can play (if any) 
in the process. 

Please let me know if you will be available to join us, and we can discuss 
specifics closer to the date. 

Best regards,
Dennis

Steve --

In a discussion today with Mike, Kelly, etc., it was apparent that the Public 
Affairs team viewed the Bahamas LNG transaction quite cautiously.  Given the 
recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political 
fights that are going the wrong way), I was wondering if it made sense to 
bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to 
analyze the implications of our development plans.  My primary worry is that 
P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being 
internalized into the transaction.

I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs 
coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. 

Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason.

Jim

Rick,

Thanks for the note.  At this point we are "fully subscribed" on interns for 
the summer, but if your team wants to interview her and bring her on, we'll 
help make it happen.  I'll ask Traci follow up with you.

Regards,

Cindy and Richard,
I promise not to send any more resumes.

However, this woman is a very, very bright first-year MBA
seeking a SUMMER internship. For an MBA, she has a
nontraditional background. But she is serious about
business and awfully smart. Also personable and mature.

Please feel free to contact me about her.

Hope all's well.

Best,
Sandy

Rick:   As Chris mentioned, we spoke to Oliver last week about the STB 
position.   I had also talked to him a few weeks ago about the same.    In 
addition, I've had several conversations with Joe Bill Watkins, an attorney 
in Austin who is working with the Greater Houston Community to find an 
"independent thinker" for this job.   

I recommend that we support Oliver Pennington.   It's clear from our 
conversations that he doesn't know much about the rail industry (he was 
inquiring about the difference between the STB's and the FRA's role in 
regulating the industry), but he appears to be -- and from all accounts, 
would be-- a fair-minded regulator.   He said he wants to "make a 
difference", and would not be afraid to shake things up to make that 
happen.   

As Chris suggests, we should not support the names being floated in the 
industry.   Bratten is a railroad sympathizer in shippers' clothing.    While 
Alice Turnquist is a good friend of Susan Lent (our lobbyist from Akin Gump), 
she is very close to Union Pacific.   Of all the rails, UP is the most 
resistant to change, and has a very well organized, very effective government 
affairs team in Washington.   

Besides Linda Morgan's spot, there is a second spot that will be open when 
Clyburn departs (his term has already expired).  I would also recommend that 
we interview Mark Palmer's friend (I cannot recall her  name) for this 
position.   She has excellent transportation experience, lives in Washington, 
and may be willing to step out to make much-needed changes to the 
industry.    We tried to reach her last week, but she was out of town for the 
holiday weekend.   I will follow up with Mark on this.

Best regards,
Lisa

		 Subject: STB Chair

Linda Morgan is the current Chair of the Surface Transportation Board and the 
Administration asked to her to stay during the transition, however it is 
highly unlikely that this will be made permanent.  The three names most often 
mentioned for the new Surface Transportation Board Chairman are Dwayne 
Ackerly (trucking company executive from Nebraska), John Bratten (National 
Grain and Feed Association Rail Committee Chair, also from Nebraska), and 
Alice Turnquist (former House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
Chair).

The railroads are not interested in the structural changes we would like to 
implement in the market and they have had a difficult time understanding the 
benefits of a secondary market in rail.  While the persons named above would 
be better than the current Chair, we are reluctant to support their 
nominations because of their close ties with the railroads (Union Pacific 
especially).  We think the ideal candidate for the job would be a fresh 
thinker that understands rail issues, but is not beholden to the railroads.

One name that has been mentioned is Texas attorney Oliver Pennington.  Lisa 
and I spoke to Mr. Pennington about the job and he is more interested in an 
SEC position, but is willing to examine the STB Chair.  We have confirmed 
that Mr. Pennington would be open to our rail proposal and would manage the 
STB as a consensus builder with all interested parties.  Mr. Pennington has 
his resume and other supporting documentation at the White House for both the 
SEC and STB positions.   Attached is Mr. Pennington's resume.  It is my 
understanding that Ken Lay has written a letter in support of Mr. 
Pennington's SEC nomination.

Mark Palmer has another name of a Washington attorney who he thought might be 
interested.   

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the
committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses
conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.
The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and
Means, Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.
Thus, the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start
of the August Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both
Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to
electricity issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the
subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all
electricity issues other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly
held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and
off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate
side, the majority staff is working on an electricity "white paper" that
may be circulated for comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1.   Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and
John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by
Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo
(D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and
essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2.   First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan
basis (with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman
amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other
than generation added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to
offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not
supply all available power during an emergency, but he ended up offering
basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old "Californa Only"
bill.)

3.   The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the
Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas "transportation
facility" shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places
until FERC has abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some
instances of "old" pipelines being considered as "historic places" under
federal law.  The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to
its package yesterday.

4.   By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require
the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse
gases down to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many
Republicans and Democrats to this amendment.

5.   By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment
to set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and
authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50
percent).

Here is a copy of the economists letter the Independent Institute released on 
health care.  It is about 330 words long.
  
http://independent.org/tii/news/OpenLetterHealthCare0002.html
 

Here is my first draft of a letter to economists for power price caps.  It is 
275 words long, so we have some room.



The tricky thing here is the interplay between retail and wholesale price 
regulation that is not present in other price control situations.  In other 
words, the public utility nature of retail prices complicates things a bit, 
so our letter will have to be careful about not losing support from 
economists who wonder if this is really about a natural monopoly 
situation--at retail at least.

Maybe instead of price decontrol at retail we can just call for a move toward 
real-time pricing.

Comments appreciated.

- Rob

Thank you for your assistance.

Harris accused of cursing Liberal critic
RICHARD MACKIE

Wednesday, June 6, 2001 
Premier Mike Harris, showing his apparent frustration over persistent 
questioning about his role in the 1995 Ipperwash affair, called Liberal MPP 
Gerry Phillips an "asshole" yesterday in the legislature.
The Premier's office later denied he had used the word.
But several Liberal and New Democrat MPP said they had heard him clearly, 
despite the clamour from both sides of the legislature that erupted with Mr. 
Phillips's attacks on the Premier.
NDP deputy leader Frances Lankin described the incident. "I am going to quote 
the Premier. As he sat down he muttered 'And you are an asshole,' speaking of 
Gerry Phillips."
She was one of several MPPs who immediately demanded that the Premier 
withdraw the remark, as parliamentary procedure requires of any impolite 
comment uttered on the floor of the legislature.
Rick Bartolucci, Liberal MPP from Sudbury, had a similar recollection. "He 
clearly said, looking down but towards Gerry, 'You're an asshole.' "
The remark was not picked up by the microphones, as the one on Mr. Harris's 
desk apparently was turned off. Attorney-General David Young was speaking at 
the time, responding to Mr. Phillips's question.
Nor was the remark recorded by the legislature's Hansard.
Speaker Gary Carr said he did not hear it and noted that there had been a 
general tumult in the legislature at the time that made it difficult to hear 
any specific comments.
Mr. Phillips's questions about Mr. Harris's role in ordering an end to a 
native protest at Ipperwash Provincial Park, which resulted in the shooting 
of Dudley George six years ago, generally result in outcries from MPPs on 
both sides of the legislature.
A statement from the Premier's Office disputed the opposition MPPs' 
assertions that Mr. Harris had used profanity in referring to Mr. Phillips.
"The Premier has the utmost respect for the legislature and his fellow MPPs 
on both sides of the House," it said. "The allegation is false."
Government House Leader Janet Ecker defended the Premier.
"I didn't hear the remark. What I do know is many times members on all sides 
of the House get a little heated up in debate. And everyone has said 
something in that legislature that, on reflection, they perhaps wished they 
hadn't said."
Last month, she was displeased when Liberal House Leader Dwight Duncan 
accused her of throwing "a hissy fit" in the legislature.
Opposition MPPs said the fact the Premier would use such language shows he 
senses the damage a public inquiry about the shooting of the unarmed native 
protester could do to his reputation.
Mr. Phillips, who said he heard the remark but refused to repeat it, 
commented: "It's tragic. This situation involves a very serious matter. And 
the Premier has chosen to try the personal attacks instead of trying to deal 
with the issue."
The veteran Liberal MPP added: "I've come to expect it from him now. . . . 
It's completely in character for him. Maybe he thinks he can bully people and 
get away with it. But I won't be bullied and most people won't be bullied."
Mr. Phillips had been asking the Premier why he is attempting to bankrupt Mr. 
George's family by forcing them to proceed with a civil suit to uncover Mr. 
Harris's role in the shooting.

Rick -- As I mentioned earlier, I had the exit interview with Joe Allen last 
week.  I received the following questions from Geriann today, but I think the 
questions are something that you should probably answer.  He currently has 
his contract which he has not yet signed, but I'll remind him I need no later 
than next week in order to pay his lump sum severance.

Please let me know if you'd like for me to work with him on these issues, 
with your guidance:

Joe Allen would like a copy of his contract.    <He still has the two 
originals of his contract>

We need to know who to handle the following expenses:

1. Can he put Austin Club dues on his expense report?

2.  Can he put his parking expenses on his expense report?

3.  Cell Phone?

4.  Subscription to newsletters and magazines?

Thanks, Geriann


Thanks.

FYI.  While Steve got it wrong, I think that it doesn't hurt for Sarah and 
Linda to know Dan Clearfield.  He was the attorney that helped negotiate the 
PA settlements.

Jim, Steve Huntoon indicated that you are now in charge of federal lobbying 
(lucky you!)  I wanted to touch base and see if you thought that I might be 
of some service in light of Nora ascension.  One idea I had is some task 
force or other group (funded primarily by Enron) in support of state market 
opening steps.  The purpose of the task force is to push the FERC to take 
actions that help the states to continue to move to open markets and/or to 
oppose steps that aren't pro-competition.  I don't know whether this idea has 
any legs or not.  Or, perhaps we could participate on behalf of Enron at FERC 
on specific issues that fall into this category.  Just a thought. Hope all is 
well with you and your family.

Rick:   

As background to this meeting, I wanted to provide you  with my understanding 
of the CFTC's current regulations:

Because EOL is a "bilateral" trading platform (one-to-many), the platform is 
currently exempt from CFTC regulation, with the exception of the CFTC's 
anti-fraud and anti-manipulation laws.   

With the passage of the CFMA, energy derivatives are exempt from CFTC 
regulation, except for certain minimum requirements.   While the CFTC can no 
longer dictate how we structure energy swaps, we can only do business with 
"eligible contract (or swap) participants."   Eligible contract/swap 
participants must meet a net worth test of $1m (for business entities).  The 
same net worth test applies to energy options (the CFMA eliminated the 
"physical handling" requirement, which required participants to be in the 
physical business before entering into energy option transactions).   

In my non-legal opinion, the CFTC has jurisdiction over EOL as a bilateral 
trading platform, and over financial transactions (whether or not they are 
transacted through EOL, over the phone, etc.).   This jurisdiction would be 
limited as discussed above.      

Thanks.

Lisa

		 Subject: EOL Regulation - CFTC or FERC?

As you are all probably aware, FERC staff will be conducting a visit to Enron 
next Monday to discuss EOL and electronic trading's role in the energy 
markets.   Dave Forester, Kevin Presto, and Phillip Allen will be giving 
presentations about the EOL platform, power trading, and gas trading, 
respectively.

In preparing for the meetings, the issue of which agency, CFTC or FERC, 
regulates the EOL platform and any energy related financial products sold by 
Enron (everyone agreed that physical deals through EOL were FERC 
jurisdictional) came up.

It is unclear about Enron's current position.  While there is a strong case 
that both the EOL platform and any energy related financial products are 
regulated by the CFTC, some people believed that Enron had previously 
informed FERC that they were the "appropriate" agency for the energy related 
financial products.

We do not intend to make an issue of this topic with the FERC staff on 
Monday, but rather wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page 
going forward.

Please let me know if we need to have a meeting to bring this to closure.

Jim

COLORADO -- Gov. Owens OKs 'no-call' list

Gov. Bill Owens (R.) yesterday signed legislation allowing
citizens to place their names on a "no-call" list if they don't
want to receive telemarketing calls.  Telemarketers can't contact
persons on the list unless they have an established business
relationship with them.  Violators of HB 1405 will be guilty of a
deceptive trade practice.

The Public Utilities Commission must contract by Jan. 1, 2002,
with an agent to maintain the Web site and database containing
the no-call list.  By July 1, 2002, the agent must develop the
no-call database.  The PUC must promulgate rules by April 1,
2002, to administer the database.

SOUTH CAROLINA -- Wireless carriers not required to contribute to
state USF

The Public Service Commission yesterday decided to exclude
wireless revenue from its universal service fund (USF).  State
law requires all telecom service providers to contribute to the
USF, but the law defines telecom services as "nonwireline
services provided in competition to landline service."

Verizon Wireless, Inc., and the PSC staff asked the PSC not to
require wireless companies to contribute to the USF.  There isn't
"sufficient evidence" that any wireless company competes with any
local service provider in South Carolina, the PSC said.  (Docket
no. 97-239-C)

GEORGIA -- BellSouth amends SGAT

BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., has filed a revised statement
of generally available terms and conditions (SGAT) for
interconnection, unbundled network elements, and resale services.
The revised SGAT implements recent Public Service Commission and
FCC decisions.

The SGAT includes several revisions that, among other things:
(1) clarify that BellSouth won't pay reciprocal compensation for
"fraudulent" traffic; (2) add forecasting requirements; (3)
expand requirements for notice, discontinuance of service, and
deposits; and (4) update service provider number portability
implementation procedures.  (Docket nos. 6863-U, 7253-U and
10692-U)

KANSAS -- KCC to review SW Bell proposed access cuts

The Corporation Commission has scheduled a June 27 hearing on
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s proposal to reduce its
intrastate switched-access rate from about 5- to 1.2-cents a
minute.  (5/18/01)  SW Bell made the proposal as part of an
agreement among the commission staff, United Telephone Companies
of Kansas, d/b/a Sprint, Sprint Communications Co. LP, and AT&T
Corp.

AT&T and Sprint agreed to pass through SW Bell's access charge
reductions to customers.  Sprint estimated that its average
residential per-minute rates would decrease 15% to 22%.  AT&T
said its "leading consumer" residential rates would decrease by
nearly 30%.

If approved, SW Bell's switched-access rate reduction would take
effect Oct. 1 and would cost the company $25-$28 million in
annual access revenue.  The revenue reduction would be offset by
increases in rates for residential and business access lines.
Rates for basic local business service would increase to a range
of $22.25 - $33.80 per month.  Rates for local business service
with optional expanded area calling service would increase to
$41.25 per month from the current rate of $36.25 per month, the
commission said.  (Docket no. 01-GIMT-082-GIT)

MICHIGAN -- House OKs number-conservation measure

The House has approved a resolution urging the FCC to approve the
Public Service Commission's request for additional number-
conservation authority.  According to HR 81, many of Michigan's
area codes are exhausting quickly because of "the lack of
efficient number distribution and the lack of FCC approval for
the PSC to institute [1,000-number block pooling]."

CONNECTICUT -- OCC says AT&T has had enough time to expand
network

The Office of Consumer Council (OCC) has asked the Department of
Public Utility Control to reject AT&T Corp.'s requested cable TV
franchise agreement extensions.  The OCC filed a motion to strike
AT&T's application that would give the company more time to
expand its Lakeville system network.  AT&T hasn't completed yet
the number of network miles required by the agreement.

The DPUC has granted a franchise term extension and instituted a
hearing to review and consider AT&T's request to modify a
franchise agreement in Vernon.  The OCC recommended revoking the
extension and objected to technical meetings.  The DPUC has ruled
that "further review and consideration of AT&T's request for
additional time to complete the system upgrade is in the public
interest."

NORTH CAROLINA -- @ Communications asks UC to arbitrate
interconnect pact

@ Communications, Inc., a data competitive local exchange
carrier, has asked the Utilities Commission to arbitrate an
interconnection agreement it's negotiating with Carolina
Telephone and Telegraph Co., d/b/a Sprint.  @ Communications
objects to Sprint's requirement that it compensate Sprint for
transporting traffic outside of Sprint's local calling areas if
the company designates one point-of-interconnection (POI) per
LATA (local access and transport area).  Sprint prefers that
CLECs designate one POI per calling area, Sprint said.

Even if it bears some responsibility for transport costs, it
should be limited to the company's percentage of originating
minutes, @ Communications said.  It said Sprint's requirement
that @ Communications "bear 100% cost responsibility regardless
of the direction of the traffic" violates the FCC's
interconnection rules.  (Docket nos. P-7, sub 969; P-10, sub 611

ILLINOIS -- ICC extends Ameritech 'alt-reg' proceeding

Briefs originally were due June 6, and replies were due June 13.

The proposed order addresses renewing Ameritech's alternative-
regulation plan.  (Docket nos. 98-0252, 98-0335, 00-0764)

ILLINOIS -- Essex asks ICC to settle interconnect dispute

Essex Telecom, Inc., has asked the Commerce Commission to settle
a dispute the company is having with Gallatin River
Communications LLC over implementing their interconnection
agreement.  According to Essex, Gallatin wants Essex to bear the
entire cost of the originating switching and transport within and
from each Gallatin local calling area to the interconnection
point (IP).

Essex has selected the Gallatin tandem in Dixon as its IP in the
LATA (local access and transport area).  Essex has established
collocation with Gallatin in Dixon.  The Essex switch is in
Sterling.

Essex says it wants to serve some customers "though what Gallatin
describes as 'virtual NXX service.'"  Essex, however, says it
provides service between the customer's physical location and the
NXX on its network.

According to Essex, "Gallatin takes the position that Essex must
compensate Gallatin for calls originated by Gallatin's customers,
routed over Gallatin's network, delivered to Essex at the IP and
then transported and terminated from the Dixon IP to the Sterling
POP to any user not physically located in the same NXX rate
center as the calling party."

Essex says Gallatin demands that it (1) have its customers pay
Gallatin for a business line between Dixon and Sterling, (2)
resell Gallatin's business line service to its customers, or (3)
pay exchange access to Gallatin before it will exchange such
traffic.  (Docket no. 01-0427 - Complaint and Request for Dispute
Resolution of Essex Telecom, Inc., Against Gallatin River
Communications LLC)

FLORIDA -- Sprint wants Verizon to resell features on 'stand-
alone' basis

Sprint Communications Co. LP has asked the Public Service
Commission to require Verizon Florida, Inc., to resell its
features on a stand-alone basis.  Verizon won't resell its
features at wholesale rates unless they are packaged with
Verizon's local dial-tone service, Sprint said.

Verizon's refusal to resell its features on a stand-alone basis
prevents Sprint from offering Internet call waiting or forwarding
to a wireless phone, "follow me" service, and "competitive"
voice-mail service, Sprint said in a petition asking the
commission to arbitrate renewal of its interconnection agreement
with Verizon.

CONNECTICUT -- '711' to be operational by mid July

The Department of Public Utility Control has set a July 16
implementation date for access to the state's telecommunications
relay service (TRS) using the abbreviated dialing code "711."
Currently, the state's TRS is accessed using an "800" number.
(5/18/99)

Because a majority of carriers support the "implementation of
education and outreach programs," the Department also has
required all carriers to develop and submit a 711 education and
outreach program jointly.  (Docket no. 99-05-15, DPUC
Investigation into the Use of 711 dialing to Access
Telecommunications Relay Service network)

MAINE -- Report extends area code's projected exhaust

The projected exhaust date for the "207" area code has been
lengthened by three years, according to a recent report by the
North American Numbering Plan administrator (NANPA).  The area
code, now projected to exhaust during third quarter 2005, was
delayed by the implementation of 1,000-number block pooling in
June 2000.  "Given that three years ago, the [NANPA] told us that
a new area code would be needed by June of 2000, we believe our
efforts have been well spent," said Public Utilities Commission
Chairman Thomas Welch.

______________________________________________________

MICHIGAN -- '269' to be new area code for '616' 'split'

The Public Service Commission has announced that "269" has been
assigned as the new area code for the portion being "split" from
the "616" area code.  The PSC order the split to relieve number
exhaustion in 616 earlier this week.  (6/6/01)

A north/south geographic split will be implemented with a
dividing line that follows the northern boundaries of Saugatuck,
Hamilton, Hopkins, Wayland, Middleville, Hastings, and Woodland
rate centers.  Customers in and to the south of these rate
centers will receive a new area code.  Customers to the north of
the rate centers will retain 616.

Permissive dialing will begin by July 13, 2002, and mandatory
dialing will begin Feb. 15, 2003.  Wireless carriers will have an
extended permissive dialing period through Feb. 15, 2004.  (Case
no. U-12850)

COLORADO -- ICG to withdraw from residential market

Bankrupt competitive local exchange carrier ICG Communications,
Inc., has informed the Public Utilities Commission that it plans
to withdraw from the residential local exchange service market.

The PUC will consider the application during its June 27 regular

disclosed to the PUC the number of Colorado residential customers
that it has.

ILLINOIS -- City mulls license for AT&T Wireless

Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley (D.) yesterday introduced an

KANSAS -- KCC wants more data on SW Bell OS proposal

The Corporation Commission has extended the deadline for
reviewing Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s application to
deregulate its operator and directory assistance services.  The
commission extended the deadline from May 21 to June 25.

The staff asked the commission provide more time to review SW
Bell's request.  "No service-specific data has been provided to
support [SW Bell's] claim of rampant competition for these
operator services," the staff said.  (Docket no. 01-SWBT-932-MIS)

Rick:

I guess you will have been reasonably pleased with the Commissions July 12th
Orders on the RTOs. It seems to be going down the same basic road we have
been discussing.

I guess there will now be a relatively short process to outline each of the
proposed mega-RTOs. While the Northeast RTO is most pinned down, the others
seem well up in the air. The Southeast RTO in particular seems to be
flailing a bit.

If you or any of your folks were keen I am very interested in the SE RTO and
Western RTO in particular. As they move beyond the usual groups of utility
guys sitting around a table it might be a good time to throw some economic
reality into the picture. Could be method for presenting some of the
thinking of the policy paper to the world?

Hope you had a good trip to London. Heard it has been very warm over there
(although not of course by Houston standards...)

TURKEY ABOLISHES THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO IMPORT NATURAL GAS

The gas bill's passage into Turkish law in May has far-reaching consequences
for international power developers, liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers into
Turkey, and incumbent players. CERA identifies two critical consequences
emerging from the new legislation:

*  Power developers may be able to renegotiate their gas supply agreements.

*  More opportunities for LNG suppliers will emerge.

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee asked Enron to support the Congressional Black Caucus 
"energy" field trip trip to Houston on Jun 28-30, 2001.  She said was going 
to call Ken Lay, but Rosalee has not taken a call.

API has been asked to coordinate the meeting and they have hired a event 
planning firm.  Jackson Lee has made it clear she wants Enron involved even 
thought were are not APIMembers.  API would like to bring the CBC to the 
Enron trading floor and gas control room.   Jackson Lee would also like to 
have Ken Lay attend a roundtable discussion on June 29. There will be several 
lavish social events which we will be inivited to attend.   We will also be 
asked to contribute to the trip.....my guess is that we are looking at over 
$40,000.

Jim Ford at API is coordinating the trip.  He will be in contact with me next 
week with more information.

Sorry the info. is so sketchy, but that is all there is so far.

Hello! Rick,

Last year, I worked closely with Ricardo on the reorganization of the 
electric industry, with the electricity transition team (Fox's group) and 
with regulatory summaries of various countries. 

Since February, I have been working very closely with Jos, Antonio Aguilar 
(Director EBS Mexico),  in the concession granting process, visiting 
companies and all the telecommunication companies in Mexico ( data centers, 
local loop and long haul providers, etc).  Mexico is the second largest 
telecommunications market for the United States after Canada, this represents 
a big opportunity for EBS. and Jos, Antonio has proposed me to work a 100% 
with EBS, and I would like to know how do you see this.  I already spoke 
about this with Ricardo and he told me to discuss it with you. 

On the other hand, about the Government Affairs meeting in Denver I would 
like to ask you if I should go.

Best regards, Kikumi

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of 
worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by 
Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, 
compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another 
increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely 
would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed 
prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a 
few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, 
long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably 
either average could be defended mathematically," said Nettie Hoge of The 
Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the 
contracts are very convoluted and complex."

Dear Linda,

 
I haven't been formally introduced to you, although I have seen you several 
times in the Houston offsites.  In the past 16 months, I have been working in 
Government and Regulatory Affairs group covering EBS global telecommunication 
issues.  Currently,  I am on secondment in London to help Jan Haizmann with 
European and Asian telecommunication licensing procedures. This September, I 
will be starting the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies 
(SAIS) master program in Washington DC.  I have a strong interest in staying 
with the government affairs group and believe that a part time position in 
the Enron DC office will be complementary to my studies at SAIS. Rick Shapiro 
encouraged me to contact you directly, suggesting that you might be willing 
to meet with me and to help me identify the employment opportunities in the 
DC office.

It may be helpful for you to know that I have been working for the past two 
year for Enron. While in Houston, I had the chance to work on number of 
interesting projects, including providing financial modeling support for the 
former Enron International group.  I am familiar with deregulation process, 
especially with the recent developments in the telecommunication field.   In 
addition, working in the London office have provided me with the opportunity 
to working with the EU Commission, the UK Parliament and other lobbying 
groups.  I believe that my experience in Enron will enable me to play a 
proactive role in the DC office.   

I will be in touch with you by phone in a week.  Next month, I will be 
passing through DC & would like to set up a short 20-30 minute meeting with 
you at a mutually convenient time. 

I understand you are busy and appreciate your time. I look forward to talking 
with you soon.

Sincerely,


Xi Xi

Rick:

I have a large set of comments on the full paper from Christi Nicollay (who
has been corrdinating this), plus the others. We will make changes as
appropriate. Sabine and I have also started a bit on the shorter version
just so we will be ready ont hat front.

At some point I guess we still need to have the conversation with Steve
(Maureen is trying to get a new date). From my perspective it would also be
useful if you and I could have a quick chat sometime. Otherwise I think we
risk losing the plot due to the elapsed time.

I will be in Toronto and DC for much of the week but you can try me on my
cellphone number (617) 513-5904.

APPROPRIATIONS
With Few Exceptions, House Approps Panels To Follow Bush Lead
   The House Appropriations Committee has developed subcommittee
spending allocations for FY02. While essentially in line with
President Bush's requests, they differ in some cases by billions
of dollars. In allocations being released today, House
appropriators are recommending $3 billion more than Bush wanted
for Labor-HHS, $1.1 billion more for VA-HUD and $1.2 billion more
for Energy and Water.
   The so-called 302(b) allocations, which the Appropriations
Committee should mark up by next week, divide the $661.3 billion
set aside in the budget resolution for total discretionary
appropriations among the 13 Appropriations subcommittees. The
proposed subcommittee allocations in the budget Bush submitted in
April, however, were based on his request that total FY02
spending be kept to $660.6 billion.
   The expected allocations are listed below by subcommittee. All
numbers are expressed in budget authority, followed by the Bush
administration proposal:
   Agriculture: $15.5 billion, compared to the Bush proposal of
$15.4 billion. Commerce-Justice-State: $38.5 billion, compared to
$37.9 billion. Defense: $300.3 billion, $301 billion. District of
Columbia: $380 million, $300 million.
   Energy and Water: $23.7 billion, $22.5 billion. Foreign
Operations: $15.2 billion, the same as Bush proposed. Interior:
$18.9 billion, $18.1 billion. Labor-HHS: $119.7 billion, $116.4
billion.
   Legislative Branch: $2.9 billion, $3 billion. Military
Construction: $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion. Transportation: $14.9
billion, $16.2 billion. Treasury-Postal: $16.9 billion, $16.6
billion. VA-HUD: $84.2 billion, $83.1 billion.
   Meanwhile, on the FY01 front, House Appropriations Chairman
Young and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., both said Thursday that they intend to stick to
the president's supplemental appropriations recommendation,
despite rumblings from some defense hawks that the Bush
administration's nearly $7 billion FY01 supplemental spending
request shortchanges the military.
   The supplemental would provide a total of  $6.1 billion for
defense, partially offset by $505 million in defense cuts.
   House Armed Services Military Readiness Subcommittee Chairman
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., called the request "totally inadequate,"
saying the needs are at least $10-15 billion.  Congress ought to
provide more money using an emergency designation, he said.
   But constrained by the budget caps and the administration's
admonitions to Congress not to abuse the emergency designation,
Young and Lewis said they plan to keep the supplemental to the
president's requested level.
   "We've got to be in the real world," said Lewis.
   The emergency designation allows money to be appropriated but
not counted against the cap.
   Lewis added that he is aiming for a full committee markup as
early as next week and conference with the Senate by July 4th.
   Should Congress add substantially to the supplemental, Chief
Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt, R-Mo., one of the
administration's allies on the Hill, said the president would be
eager to show his commitment to fiscal discipline with a veto.
   "The president won't be hesitant to veto an early bill," Blunt
said. "I think they're looking for an early opportunity to show
their commitment to discipline on spending. I wouldn't be at all
surprised, if we gave them the opportunity with the supplemental,
[to see a veto]."
   In the Senate, where OMB Director Daniels met briefly Thursday
with Appropriations Chairman Byrd and ranking member Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, a senior Senate aide predicted the Senate also would
stick with the president's overall number on the supplemental.
   Daniels, who has insisted that the FY01 supplemental be kept
to "true current-year needs" and stay within the budget caps,
defended the supplemental as it was submitted to Congress.
   "I think Congress is going to see that these items are about
the right ones," Daniels said. -- By Lisa Caruso

HOUSE LEADERSHIP
Senate Storm Only A Drizzle In House
   Despite Minority Leader Gephardt's plea this week for a new
era of bipartisan collaboration, the Democratic takeover of the
Senate is unlikely to have much impact on partisan relations in
the House, according to House Republican leaders with close ties
to the Bush White House.
   In fact, one key leader, House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy
Blunt, R-Mo., said House Republicans feel liberated to pass
legislation more to their liking.
   "Those of us on the House side feel we have an increased
opportunity to get our work done without having to give
overwhelming consideration to how it impacts the Senate," Blunt
said. "Not that we won't be considerate, but there won't be
overwhelming consideration. Previously, we held back on some
things in consideration of Senator Lott's challenges."
   Blunt, who is a key liaison between congressional Republicans
and the White House, said he expected the House to pass an energy
bill, a prescription drug benefit, a campaign finance reform
measure--and perhaps legislation to make permanent this year's
package of tax cuts--all before the August recess.
   "These will all be placed on Mr. Daschle's desk before we go
home for the August break," Blunt said, suggesting the pressure
will be on the Senate Democratic leadership to come to terms with
bills backed by the House and President Bush.
   House Speaker Hastert sketched out a similar agenda for the
balance of the year in an interview Thursday--mentioning energy,
prescription drugs and campaign finance reform as well as a
patients' bill of rights and renewal of presidential trade
negotiating authority as top priorities.
   He also spoke favorably about a cost-of-living increase for
members of Congress, a subject he discussed earlier in the day
with Gephardt. Lawmakers "ought to be able to keep up with the
cost of living so that they can take care of their families and
provide for their families like everybody else does,'' Hastert
said. "I think that's the decent thing to do.''
   Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs House GOP leadership
meetings, told CongressDaily that the most tangible difference
since Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., decided last month to bolt the
Republican Party was "a little more sensitivity by the White
House and our leadership in reaching out to moderates...Where you
might see a little change is the sensitivity to the fact that we
are a diverse party and we need to listen to both wings."
   Gephardt said this week that Jeffords' move could "embolden"
GOP moderates in the House to work with Democrats.
   But Portman, who served in the administration of Bush's father
and has strong ties to the current White House, noted that
moderate GOP Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio already serves in the
elected leadership as Conference secretary.  And Rep. Doug Ose,
R-Calif., serves as a liaison from the moderate wing to the GOP
leadership.
   "We've already formalized something that the Senate
[Republicans] are just now formalizing," Portman said in
reference to the appointment of Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., as the
moderates' representative within leadership. Portman did not
indicate that any new approach to the House Democratic leadership
was imminent.
   In the two weeks since Jeffords' switch, House Republican
moderates have praised Hastert's leadership of and played down
any tensions within their Conference.
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., for example, said he thought the
Senate switch ultimately would allow Bush to play to his strength
as a master of compromise--but, in the meantime, expressed
confidence in the way House GOP leaders were handling the agenda.
   "Our moderates went to Jeffords and their message was, `Our
views are being taken into consideration,'" Blunt said, pointing
to efforts by Reps. Christopher Shays and Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, among others, to persuade Jeffords to stay put.
   Gephardt this week said he stood "with olive branches in both
hands," but that the House Republican leadership has stiff-armed
Democrats at both the leadership and committee levels.
   "Civility has been improved, but we haven't had real
bipartisanship," Gephardt told reporters.
   House Republicans did not exactly thrash Gephardt with those
olive branches, but they did make clear that they have a
different definition of bipartisanship.
   "Look at the number of bipartisan meetings we held over the
first six months [of 2001]," said one White House aide, who noted
that Karl Rove, Bush's top political adviser, has been keeping
score of all the meetings with Democrats. "Clinton's numbers [of
meetings with Republicans] just pale in comparison....We did a
lot to advance bipartisanship over the first six months and we'll
just keep on doing it."
   Portman said: "I don't buy [Gephardt's] premise. The two most
important bills, education and taxes, were not rammed through on
party-line votes."
   But a source close to the Blue Dog Coalition of conservative
House Democrats reiterated that group's complaint that
Republicans have refused to consult with them on the development
of legislation.
   The Blue Dog source said the House GOP leadership already has
made clear that it will not pursue a more cooperative strategy.
   A House Democratic leadership source said: "It's been clear
for a long time that the Republican leadership has never showed
any interest in bipartisan cooperation. It may take them awhile
to come around."
   The source said the problem extended to the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue, as well, declaring, "The president has given
Democrats and moderates pats on the back and nicknames, and he's
given conservative Republicans a tax cut and the Justice
Department." -- By Charlie Mitchell

HOUSE RACES
Largent Will Resign From House, Calls For Early Special Election
   Setting the stage for the House's seventh special election
this year, Republican Rep. Steve Largent announced Thursday that
he will resign his Tulsa-based 1st District seat in November to
concentrate on his race for Oklahoma governor.
   "It is my opinion that the race for governor will become a
full-time endeavor in the months ahead," Largent said.
"Therefore, today I announce my plan to resign ... on Nov. 29,
exactly seven years to the day I was first sworn into Congress."
   Largent called on the state Legislature and GOP Gov. Frank
Keating to pass a law in the Legislature's upcoming special
session, to schedule a special election before Largent's
effective resignation date.
   "I will make such a request in writing soon to encourage them
to allow the election to take place prior to my actual
resignation, as was done in 1994 with [former Democratic Sen.]
David Boren's departure from the U.S. Senate," Largent said.
   "This action would ensure that the 1st District is never
without representation in Washington," Largent said.
   Largent, formerly a record-setting wide receiver for the
Seattle Seahawks, entered the House when GOP Sen. James Inhofe
resigned the House seat to assume Boren's Senate seat.
   During his tenure, Largent has earned a reputation as a
champion of Christian conservative causes. He has occasionally
bucked his party's leadership and supported the 1997 coup attempt
against former House Speaker Gingrich. He unsuccessfully
challenged House Majority Leader Armey in 1998.
   In his resignation announcement, Largent said he would remain
neutral in the GOP primary, which already has grown contentious
in anticipation of Largent's gubernatorial run.
   The Republican field for Largent's seat includes state Rep.
John Sullivan, state Sen. Scott Pruitt and Oklahoma First Lady
Cathy Keating, the wife of the Republican governor, whose term is
up in 2002.

   National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis
of Virginia Thursday called the seat "strongly Republican,"
noting that Largent never had received less than 62 percent of
the vote in the district.
   Nonetheless, at least two Democrats have considered entering
the race.
   Tulsa School Board member Doug Dodd appears to be the likely
Democratic nominee, while former Tulsa County Democratic Party
leader Tim Gilpin does not appear inclined to run.
   Oklahoma Democratic Chairman Jay Parmley said Oklahoma
Democrats would have to work hard to convince national Democrats
they can win the seat, but he was confident about the prospects.
   "That seat is competitive for Democrats," Parmley said. "Make
no mistake about it."
   During the 107th Congress, the deaths of Reps. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., Norman Sisisky, D-Va., and Joe Moakley, D-Mass., have
necessitated special elections.
   Largent joins former Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., and Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla., in retirement announcements.
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., also is expected to resign his
seat to accept a position in the Bush administration (see related
article, below). -- By Mark Wegner

JUDICIARY
Hutchinson's Promotion May Suspend Liability Legislation
   The impending departure of Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose
nomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration is
expected to be confirmed by the Senate, has left the business
community scrambling to find a new champion for a comprehensive
bill to limit legal liability for business.
   Hutchinson is the chief House sponsor of legislation backed by
the National Federation of Independent Business and the National
Association of Wholesalers. It would cap punitive damages for
small businesses and for product sellers.
   Introduced last month, the bill restricts punitive damages
against businesses with fewer than 25 employees and limits awards
to three times the total amount awarded for economic damages or
$250,000, whichever is less.
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
are sponsors of a similar bill in the Senate. However, the loss
of Hutchinson, a high-profile member of the House Judiciary
Committee and a visible spokesman for legal reform, is a blow for
bill proponents, observers said this week.
   And the loss is even more significant, they say, given the
shift in power to Senate Democrats and its likely implications
for legal reform legislation in general.
   The task of gathering the votes to secure cloture for the most
viable of the pending legal reform measures--on product liability
and class action reform--was considered daunting in a closely
divided Senate. But with Democrats controlling the agenda,
numerous sources have surmised that securing either hearing
commitments or floor time in that chamber may be nearly
impossible.
   At the same time, some observers noted, the bipartisan appeal
of the small business community--combined with President Bush's
expected effort later in his term to advance his civil-justice
reform agenda--could help move the ball on some piecemeal
reforms.
   This is not the first time this year that supporters of
product liability legislation have had to hunt for congressional
sponsors: The legislation's sponsors in the past Congress
included former Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., and former Sens. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., and Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., all of whom lost
their 2000 re-election bids. -- By Pamela Barnett

LABOR
GOP Praises Chao On Ergonomics Forums; Dems Seek New Rule
   House Education and the Workforce Chairman Boehner and
Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood, R-
Ga., praised Labor Secretary Chao's decision to hold three public
forums on ergonomics next month and develop a course of action by
September.
   "We know Secretary Chao will use these hearings to search for
a consensus approach that protects workers without jeopardizing
their jobs or placing America's economy in an ill-conceived
regulatory straightjacket," they said in a joint statement.
   "We are bringing everyone to the table to get this important
issue moving forward and resolved," Chao said Thursday.
   But Democrats were more circumspect.
   "We hope this is not just the policy of procrastination--
that's what we want to avoid," said John Lawrence, minority staff
director of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. "If
it's the first step to getting to a rule, then we welcome it."
   Ranking member George Miller, D-Calif., and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., sent a letter to Chao in April, urging her to
issue a new rule. But Chao has not committed herself to doing so.
   After Congress voted in March to eviscerate the Clinton
administration ergonomics rules, which would have required
employers to prevent and compensate employees who experienced
problems such as repetitive-stress disorders, Chao promised to
review them and issued a set of guiding principles on the issue.
   The principles that Chao says ergonomics action should be
based on are: prevention, sound science, incentive-driven,
flexibility, feasibility and clarity.
   A strong advocate of the Clinton rule, the AFL-CIO is
"analyzing the recent announcement" and will "respond in the very
near future," said Jay Power, the union's legislative
representative.
   Manufacturers, who opposed the Clinton rule, have said in the
past that they would welcome the opportunity to revisit the
issue.
   The forums will be held in Washington July 16, Illinois July
20 and California July 24. -- By April Fulton

HEALTH
FDA Officials Issue Public Safety Warning On Mailed Drugs
   As legislators in the House and Senate gear up for another
attempt to relax a 1988 law that bars the reimportation of U.S.-
made prescription drugs, federal officials told a House Commerce
subcommittee that the volume of drugs being sent through the mail
has already overwhelmed their ability to ensure the public's
safety.
   "We estimate that approximately two million parcels containing
FDA-regulated products for personal use enter the U.S. each year
through international mail facilities that Customs could set
aside for FDA review for possible violations" of law, FDA Senior
Associate Commissioner for Policy William Hubbard told the House
Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.
   Because that is far more than FDA officials can inspect,
Hubbard testified, "the tens of thousands of parcels that FDA
does not review are eventually released by Customs and sent on to
their addresses," despite potential risks.
   Hubbard's testimony included the agency's strongest language
yet about what it perceives as the serious public health risk of
individuals using the Internet or other means to purchase
prescription drugs from overseas. Such drugs, he said, "may be
contaminated, subpotent, superpotent or counterfeit."
   "FDA and the public do not have any assurance that unapproved
products are effective or safe, or have been produced under U.S.
good manufacturing practices," he testified. "U.S.-made drugs
that are reimported may not have been stored under proper
conditions, or may not be the real product, because the [United
States] does not regulate foreign distributors or pharmacies."
   In a pilot project in California earlier this year, FDA
examined approximately 1,900 of some 16,000 packages flagged as
suspicious by Customs officials. Hubbard testified that some of
those packages contained drugs that could not be identified,
drugs with labeling only in foreign languages, and drugs that
have been specifically rejected for approval in the United States
by the FDA.
   "Several shipments contained three drugs that were once
approved by FDA but have been withdrawn from the market based on
serious safety concerns," he testified.
   Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee were united in
their outrage over the situation.
   For sellers of such dangerous products over the Internet, said
Subcommittee Chairman Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., "Their motto might
very well be `there's a sucker logging on every minute.'"
   Last month, Greenwood, subcommittee ranking member Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla., and Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., toured the
international mail facility at Dulles Airport, and "what we found
was truly frightening," Greenwood said, including pills hidden in
carbon paper in a failed attempt to evade detection.
   Energy and Commerce ranking member John Dingell, D-Mich.,
whose investigations as head of the oversight committee led to
the 1988 law making reimportation illegal, said the new
information shows that regulation needs to be tightened rather
than loosened.
   But while Dingell called last year's legislative attempt to
overturn the 1988 law a "misguided effort to attempt to lower
prices by opening up our borders," he said Congress must
recognize that individuals are turning to foreign drugs because
they cannot afford to buy them in the United States. -- By Julie

HEALTH
Bilirakis Panel `Open-Minded' On Addressing Generic Drug Law
   Although some members of Congress and the brand-name
pharmaceutical companies are skeptical, the House Energy and
Commerce Committee is keeping its options open to add drug patent
reform to a Medicare prescription drug bill that it is drafting
as a way to save money.
   "We do feel we should learn enough about them [the generic
drug issues]; that's why we're having the hearing next week,"
said House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee Chairman
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.
   The committee is holding a Wednesday hearing on drug issues
and hopes to have the outline of its prescription drug bill plan
"in the next few days" following the hearing, he said.
   "We're trying to stay open-minded," Bilirakis said.
   But Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said he worries about opening
up the 1984 drug patent law he wrote with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah, particularly in the context of a broader Medicare
prescription drug bill.
   "It's not a natural fit," Waxman said.
   However, Waxman said the law might have some problems that
should be addressed.
   These include a 30-month stay that prevents generic products
from coming to market if a brand-name company claims a patent
infringement, and the 180-day period during which the first
producer of a generic drug on the market can prevent others from
competing with it.
   Hatch and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., now the chairman of
the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where the
issue could pop up on the Senate side, have expressed
reservations about opening the bill in the past.
   The brand-name drug industry has not shown much interest in
revamping the Hatch/Waxman law, but the generic drug companies
argue they are being unfairly barred from the market through
patent challenges.
   But brand-name advocates are bracing for a fight against any
such move. A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America said it "would only jeopardize
prescription drug coverage for seniors."
   Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and John McCain, R-Ariz., and
Reps. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, recently
introduced bills to help generic drugs get to market sooner.
   Schumer said this week that prospects for the bills improved
with Democratic control of the Senate, but Senate aides said no
official discussions have taken place since the changeover. -- By

TRADE
EU Officials Worried By Bush Steel Probe, U.S. `Unilateralism'
   Swedish Ambassador to the United States Jan Eliasson and
European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy both said Thursday
that President Bush's decision to launch a Section 201
investigation of steel imports is likely to put a damper on next
week's EU-U.S. summit.
   Eliasson, said the steel decision would be "troublesome" to a
planned discussion on how the world's two largest trading
partners can avoid trade disputes and advance a new trade round.
   Eliasson, who represents all 15 EU member countries while
Sweden holds the group's presidency for the six months ending
June 30, spoke to reporters Thursday at an embassy briefing in
advance of the summit in Gothenberg, Sweden.
   Eliasson also said that developing a joint EU-U.S. statement
on global warming and the future of the Kyoto Protocol is proving
to be the most difficult aspect of pre-summit negotiations.
   Eliasson said the Europeans see "no alternative" to continuing
the Kyoto Protocol talks, which Bush has rejected. Eliasson also
said Bush must expect environmental protesters in Gothenburg.
   Lamy, who was in Washington for meetings on Capitol Hill, told
an Economic Strategy Institute luncheon, "We in Europe do not
accept the assumption that imports are the cause of the [steel]
problem."
   The European Union, he noted, has cut 50 million tons of
capacity and eliminated 750,000 jobs in the steel industry
without introducing import restrictions.
   Lamy said it would serve a purpose "to get the facts of this
troubled world industry out into the open."
   The European Union had proposed to the United States that the
fact finding process take place in the Organization for Economic
Development and Cooperation, Lamy said, but never received a
reply to its suggestion.
   Asked at a news conference after his speech about reports that
Bush initiated the steel action to get votes for trade
negotiating authority and to help launch a new round of trade
talks, Lamy said, "If at the end of the day, the European
steelworkers have to pay this way, I'm not sure the new round
will be very popular in Europe."
   Lamy also said the Europeans "are becoming concerned about
what we feel are growing pressures on this side of the Atlantic
toward unilateralism."
   Responding to speculation that the United States and the
European Union would make an announcement in Gothenburg about
launching a new round, Lamy said that would be "premature."
   Eliasson said Bush and European officials would discuss
foreign policy in the western Balkans, the Middle East and
Russia, the Korean Peninsula, the spread of HIV in Africa, and
the death penalty as well as trade policy and climate change. --

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Senate GOP Offers Plan For Nominees In Organizing Talks
   Senate Republican negotiators have agreed among themselves on
what formal assurances to seek from Democrats that the Senate
will take up President Bush's nominees quickly.
   But they have yet to reach a final agreement with Majority
Leader Daschle on a new organizing resolution for the Senate.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Thursday that Republicans were
delivering to Daschle a GOP-drafted document dealing with Bush
nominations. Senators said the document would be the basis for
some sort of memorandum of understanding or other formal
statement about nominees.
   Although Democrats did not have a direct hand in drafting the
statement, the general concepts have been negotiated during two
meetings between Daschle and a five-member GOP negotiating team.
   "The concepts that we've discussed with [Daschle] ... were not
turned down," said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   Domenici said the two sides were "getting close," and the GOP
proposal was "trying to reflect the views of all of the senators
that we talked to."
   A GOP aide said the goal was to have the Senate pass a new
organizing resolution Tuesday. That would provide time for the
two sides to come to a final agreement that could be vetted by
the entire Democratic Caucus and the GOP Conference, which meet
separately Tuesday.
   Both sides said the process has gone smoothly, a reflection of
a GOP decision to drop threats of a filibuster and demands that
any agreement include a mechanism to guarantee the swift movement
of nominees. -- By Geoff Earle

Bush To Nominate Veteran GOP Aide To Head SSA
   The White House announced Thursday that President Bush intends
to nominate Jo Anne Barnhart to a six-year term as head of the
Social Security Administration--which pumps out $450 billion a
year to 45 million, mainly elderly, pension recipients.
   Barnhart's appointment as Social Security commissioner is
subject to Senate confirmation.
   The commissioner's job is always a sensitive position because
of the vast administrative responsibility to make the checks go
out on time and keep the records straight.  But with the
president and congressional Democrats poised for a possible
battle over his plan to introduce personal stock-market accounts
to the system, the job could be even tougher than normal.
   Barnhart is a veteran GOP administrator of social programs
with strong links to ex-Sen. William Roth, R-Del. She was a
legislative assistant to Roth from 1977-1981 and ran his re-
election campaigns in 1988, 1994 and 2000. She served as
political director of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee during the 1995-96 cycle.
   Barnhart also has held social program positions in the federal
government:  Her highest post was HHS assistant secretary for
children and families 1990-93. Barnhart is currently a member of
the Social Security Advisory Board, which advises the president,
Congress and the commissioner on matters related to Social
Security and Supplemental Security Income.

Census Monitoring Board Study Questions Statistical Sampling
   Republican members of the Census Monitoring Board Thursday
released a report that they say bolsters the accuracy of the 2000
decennial census and questions the methodology of statistical
sampling.
   Board member David Murray questioned the "post-strata"
adjustment factors the bureau was going to use to calculate how
many people live in a specific geographical area.
   "Adjusting data for persons from New York City with data from
persons in Miami and Seattle has troubling implications,
especially when there are important geographic dimensions in the
use of census data," Murray said.
   Sampling means taking a comprehensive survey of the nation's
population and using the common characteristics of people in one
area to extrapolate the likely makeup of other, similar census
blocks.
   Board co-chairman Mark Neuman called the 2000 census "the most
accurate census in history" and said Census Bureau experts were
right to recommend against releasing sampling data for
congressional redistricting.
   Facing a statutory deadline to deliver census data, a special
bureau panel recommended in early March against releasing sampled
data, concluding that it could not endorse sampling as more
accurate than traditional data.
   Democratic supporters of sampling have vigorously argued that
with more time, statisticians might be able to validate the
sampling data.

TRANSPORTATION
Mica Schedules June Hearing To Evaluate Airline Improvements
   House Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee
Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., has scheduled a June 20 hearing to
give legislators the opportunity to evaluate the progress the
airlines are making in improving customer service.
   The hearing was scheduled in the wake of the airlines'
unveiling Thursday of a new series of voluntary commitments to
improve service, along with an agreement to make these service
commitments legally enforceable by including them in customer
contracts.
   The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved
legislation earlier this year granting airlines limited antitrust
immunity to discuss and coordinate flight schedules; Mica said he
expected a floor vote during the week of July 9. The House
Judiciary Committee has received a referral on that bill, but the
referral expires July 9.

GOP Lawmakers Introduce Legislation On Monuments
   House Resources Chairman Hansen and nine other lawmakers
announced the filing of the National Monument Fairness Act
Thursday.
   "The American people deserve a voice in how their own public
lands are managed," said Hansen. "The bill gives them that voice.
Under this bill, when a president creates a monument larger than
50,000 acres, he must solicit input from the public and the
affected governor and congressional delegation."
   The bill also gives Congress two years to approve the
monument. After that time, if Congress has not approved the
measure, the president's proclamation sunsets.
   "This means people who don't want a big monument in their
state can talk to their local leaders, their governor or their
congressional delegation," said Hansen.
   At a news conference, Hansen was joined by an original sponsor
of the bill, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, along with GOP Reps.
George Radanovich of California, Greg Walden of Oregon, Chris
Cannon of Utah, Jim Gibbons of Nevada, Dennis Rehberg of Montana
and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

Allison and I had a good discussion with Boucher's telecom staffer/leg 
counsel, Johanna Mikes.  She hadn't heard the Enron/EBS story, so first 
provided that.

We then discussed the specifics of the cable issue, and learned from Johanna 
the following:

a) the bill will be introduced in Judiciary, not in Energy and Commerce 
b) this year's bill will not include any of the 251 sections which were 
contained in last year's legislation (and which I told her off-the-record 
would be a deal killer for Enron)

She accepted our suggestions that the language as currently written covers 
only broadcasters, ie, those who already have some access to the cable 
platform.  I suggested they include provisions that cable operators not 
discriminate against non-affiliated video programming and other ITV content, 
and further that they not discriminate against this type of content delivered 
via the internet.  She accepted these suggestions.

Boucher will now draft new language and share it with us.  After we 
comment/sign-off, they'll approach Bob Goodlatte for co-sponsorship and 
buy-in.  Disney and others will play high profile roles as well.

Boucher very much wants Enron's support on this -- and given the openness 
with which our comments were received, as well as the fact that they will 
withdraw the damaging 251 clauses and make this a focused cable access bill, 
I would suggest you relay our full support and appreciation to Boucher when 
you see him next week.

Steve

Thanks for the info.  Will call to discuss.

By the way, Peggy Hegg didn't say Enron, did she?  I thought she just said a 
financial player.

Subject: FERC Staff Concerns on the Gas Side

Folks -- 

Had a good discussion with a Senior Staff member at FERC in preparation for 
the Pipelines Outreach meeting next week.  He told me that the two issues on 
the gas side that are of primary concern to the Commission are 1) Marketing 
Affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines (Think El Paso); and 2) the 
failure of CFTC and/or SEC to more closely oversee derivative trading. 

Apparently, staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers 
on an affiliated pipeline, and some form of filing/reporting requirement to 
better understand the derivative market.  Due to a lack of information, some 
at FERC are assuming the worst.    

I believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been 
presented to Senior Staff or Commissioners as a recommendation.  I think 
Staff would appreciate some information (ammo) to refute the need to further 
regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading.

INGAA filed comments and a study concerning Marketers' use of affiliated 
pipelines in response to the Marketing Affiliate Conference at FERC.  These 
are attached.   Staff questions whether the underlying information remains 
accurate.  We are considering whether to update the underlying information 
used in the INGAA Study and how best to address these issues (probably during 
Q&As) during the Staff Outreach.

I believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that Leslie 
Lawner used at the last Market Affiliate conference to request a meeting as 
part of the current Staff Outreach to discuss Staff's concerns.  In addition, 
I think it would be helpful to request a separate ENRON meeting with Staff to 
discuss how the derivative market works and why FERC does not need to 
establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in 
these markets.  Unfortunately, in this meeting we would probably be asked 
about our involvement in the El Paso Merchant Transportation deal into 
California, in light of Peggy Hegg's comment on the Frontline Show that El 
Paso hedged some of the risk with Enron.  

We can discuss further on Friday's call.  Later Joe

Dear Mr Shapiro 

I'm e-mailing you at the suggestion of Paul Dawson in London. My colleague 
Ian Fletcher has discussed with Mark Schroeder and Paul the possibility of 
arranging a secondment to Enron from my current post at the UK Government's 
Department of Trade & Industry (DTI). 

I am hoping to arrange a suitable posting to start late September 2001 and to 
last around two years. I would optimally like to be based in or around Los 
Angeles (so that I can live with my wife who will be in LA for the next two 
years) but understand that for Enron San Francisco is likely to be the 
closest location with any openings.

I attach a copy of my CV which outlines my experience, skills and 
achievements to date. You will see that I have already established a 
successful and varied career in the public sector - most recently in the 
energy sector. At this point I am looking for an opportunity to acquire real 
commercial experience using the skills I've already proved, whilst building 
up new ones. 

My colleague Maureen Verrall +44 (0) 20 7215 8022 manages the DTI's 
secondment team and would be able to talk through the practical and financial 
details.

Would it be possible for us to have a phone conversation at some point in the 
next few days? My direct office number is +44 (0) 20 7215 0237 or I could 
call you if that would be more convenient.

Yours sincerely, 

Edward Barker

Wyoming Governor Geringer has been a leader on energy issues in the West 
since (at least) the end of 2000 (when California's energy crisis pushed the 
Western Governor's Association to hold an emergency session in Denver).  
Based on discussions with his staff, it appears that the Governor likes our 
company and supports our efforts to open markets.  His public comments, which 
are developed by the Governor's office with little outside influence, match 
both the direction and intent of many of our own policy objectives.

You asked that I summarize my observations from yesterday's meeting of the 
Wyoming Energy Commission.  

I participated in the first session of the Wyoming Energy Commission at the 
Governor's invitation.  (We were invited as the keynote speaker for the 
session).  The Commission was created by the Wyoming legislature to look at 
Wyoming's energy future from the standpoint of both consumers and the 
producers.  The Commission was given a $1 million budget and authority to 
take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state.  

In conversations with the Governor's staff; it appears that they are familiar 
with commodity markets--particularly ag products.  They understand the 
concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best 
when there is adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail 
capacity.  They also understand that their are some contraints on the 
transmission system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints 
moving north, south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major 
pipeline serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and 
some problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  
While they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't 
been able to put it all together in a cohesive way.  They want our help in 
putting together the various pieces of the energy puzzle.  

I can't help but think that there is opportunity for Enron in Wyoming either 
as an advisor (for a fee) or as a business partner--e.g., there has to be 
some room for combining the energy markets--i.e., arbitraging the value of a 
coal-fired kWh and a gas-fired kWh or providing some incremental improvement 
to the market for their sale of commodity out of state.  There also may be 
some opportunity to develop coal-fired or gas-fired plant.

Indeed, Wyoming is a major producer of natural gas (including coal-bed 
methane) and coal.  They want to produce more, but want to avoid the boom and 
bust cycle of a resource dependent state.  (For example, the state moved from 
a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 to an approximately $750 million surplus in 
FY 2000).  They also want to diversify the state's economy and bring economic 
development.  For example, a major focus of the state's Business Council has 
been to recruit "server farms"--because of their load and high load factors.  
They talked about co-locating server farms and generation along the southern 
tier of the state (which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth 
available).  While it is unclear, the bandwidth they are mentioning may be 
EBS fiber.

Let me know how you want to proceed.  It's rare when you get a Governor that 
has some understanding of commodity businesses and wants to provide 
leadership on energy issues.

I received the following from David in Investor Relations.  As you can see, 
he indicated we could contact the analyst directly.  I'm not sure this is a 
good idea, but I wanted to send the info along to you in the event you might 
find it useful.  

FYI - the attached reports provided no info on Powell's meetings w/ analysts.

Cindy and Richard,
I promise not to send any more resumes.

However, this woman is a very, very bright first-year MBA
seeking a SUMMER internship. For an MBA, she has a
nontraditional background. But she is serious about
business and awfully smart. Also personable and mature.

Please feel free to contact me about her.

Hope all's well.

Best,
Sandy

Yes.  I just didn't want to blindside you with some RCRs on Monday.  We have 
at least three in the mix.  One, as you know, pertains to Michael Lewan.  
Two, is for Dan Watkiss to do our open access rulemaking.  Three, we need to 
ask V&E help us with drafting some electricity provisions to give to Kelliher 
next week for inclusion in the DOE/White House electricity legislation.

The Commission issued a couple of orders in PJM last week:

PJM=01,s Load Response Program:  FERC approved implementation of two load=
=20
response pilot programs proposed by PJM which will be effective June 1, 200=
1=20
through May 31, 2002.  Under the first program, referred to as the =01&Emer=
gency=20
Option,=018 a PJM member may sign up to be a participant in the program and=
 will=20
be paid the higher of the relevant zonal LMP or $500/MWh for the actual kWh=
=20
relief provided when the PJM member nominates load reduction in response to=
 a=20
request from PJM.  Under the second option, referred to as the =01&Economic=
=20
Option,=018 the PJM member will be able to reduce load in response to econo=
mic=20
signals, regardless of whether emergency conditions exist.  PJM will bill t=
he=20
LSE serving the end-use customer the LMP that would have been charged absen=
t=20
the reduction.  PJM will then refund to the LSE the retail generation and=
=20
transmission charges that the LSE would have received had the load not been=
=20
reduced.  The difference between the amount billed and refunded to the LSE=
=20
will be paid to the end-user.

Several customers opposed PJM=01,s programs, particularly the Economic Opti=
on. =20
However, FERC found that both programs allow end use customers to see price=
s=20
and respond to them when it is economically beneficial for them to do so. =
=20
FERC noted that because PJM's current market structure does not communicate=
=20
wholesale prices to retail customers in real time, they have no incentive t=
o=20
reduce demand when prices increase.  FERC finds that PJM's plan will, in=20
part, fix this flaw in its market structure.  PJM is required to file a=20
report with FERC by the end of the year evaluating the effectiveness of the=
=20
program.

Changes to PJM's Reliability Assurance Agreement (RAA):  FERC also approved=
=20
PJM's proposed changes to its RAA, effective June 1.  PJM had requested FER=
C=20
authorization to change the RAA by i) adjusting the time period over which =
an=20
LSE must commit generation resources to PJM to meet its capacity obligation=
s=20
under the RAA, from a daily to a seasonal commitment; ii) adjusting the=20
deficiency charge provisions to provide for a seasonal, rather than a daily=
,=20
penalty for LSEs; and iii) requiring generation owners to commit excess=20
capacity to PJM seasonally, rather than daily, in order to participate in a=
ny=20
distribution of revenues from capacity deficiency charges paid by LSEs.  EP=
MI=20
supported PJM's changes, stating that although the ICAP requirement should =
be=20
eliminated entirely, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction=
=20
in resolving the delisting problem.

In approving the changes, FERC stated that moving from daily to seasonal=20
deficiency charges discourages generators from delisting capacity during th=
e=20
summer and gives LSEs the incentive to meet their capacity obligations,=20
thereby helping PJM to meet its short-term and long-term reliability goals.=
 =20
FERC also said that PJM's Market Monitoring Unit will be able to monitor=20
generator gaming behavior and take appropriate action if necessary.

Rick and Sue,

I exhausted many resources in my attempt to get this information (Enron 
Investor Relations, our PR group, newswires, Wall Street websites, etc.).  I 
found nothing, and then called the TR Daily editorial staff.  Here's what I 
learned:

Powell met with Frank Governali on May 30 to discus Powell's 
interest/determination in promoting competition in the CLEC sector.  
Governali is an analyst w/ Goldman, Sachs.  Accompanying Governali were 6-8 
of his largest clients, primarily pension and/or mutual fund managers.  The 
editorial staff member I spoke with indicated that the names of the fund 
managers are typically not disclosed publicly, and TR does not know their 
identities.

I was also told that Powell met with Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Hexter and 
possibly Adam Quinton (heavily active in the telecom industry) on 
May 31.  The topic was the same as the May 30 meeting w/ Goldman, Sachs.  
Another meeting is planned for the near future (perhaps today?) with Lehman 
Bros.  The analyst is not definitively known, but is suspected to be Blake 
Bath.

I hope this has been somewhat helpful.  I will watch the press for any 
additional information in the coming days and will forward anything that I 
find to you.  Please let me know if you need anything further - and keep the 
inquiries coming - I enjoy the challenge!

NGA Corporate  Fellows
News from the National Governors Association's  Corporate Fellows Program


Make Your Voice Heard; Respond To NGA Survey 

June 8, 2001  

Hello, Corporate Fellows! June 1 has come and gone and we have only  received 
three responses to the survey. Many thanks to Pete Poynter of  BellSouth, 
Molly Phillips of Feld Entertainment and John Riggen of Agilent  Technologies 
for completing theirs on time. In order for us to respond  to your interests 
and to effect change in the program, we need to hear  from all of you. Again, 
I ask that you review the survey,  and a letter  and memo from  Ray that 
describes upcoming events and program improvements. Return the  survey to my 
attention no later than June 27. Our goal is to get  100 percent 
participation, so please take approximately 15 minutes and  complete the 
survey.  

On a separate note, June 15 is fast approaching. For those of  you interested 
in nominating yourselves or other Corporate Fellows for  the Steering Group, 
please do so as soon as possible. Again, complete  the nomin ation  form and 
return it to my attention. Also, if you haven't already done  so, take a look 
at the criteria for selection to determine eligibility.  

The Springtime in Washington reception was a big success. Sorry some  of you 
were not able to attend. You missed a wonderful evening of great  
conversation, good food and wonderful music - not to mention the location,  
which was one of the best. My sincere thanks to all of you who helped  make 
it a success. We could not have done it without your support. The  reception 
provided a great opportunity for our new intern, Brett Rosenberg,  to meet 
Corporate Fellows, Governors Washington Representatives, and NGA  staff. 
Brett will be with us until August 15 conducting research on a  wide variety 
of issues (including energy) that are important to the Corporate  Fellows.  

Hope all is well and that the approaching end of the legislative season  will 
find you all in good spirits.  

Regards, 
Lynn  

Annual Meeting in Providence, Rhode  Island 

As a reminder, the Annual Meeting will take place from August 4-7.  I have 
confirmed plans with my colleagues John Thomasian and Peter Wiley  to have 
the Corporate Fellows luncheon include governors chiefs of staff  and policy 
advisors. Again, I have only received one recommendation for  a luncheon 
speaker. Please complete the luncheon  speaker form with your suggestion(s) 
and return it to me as soon  as possible but no later than June 15.  

Please watch for news regarding registration for the Annual Meeting.  
Registrations this year will be done online only. The website should be  live 
on June 18. This year we will have two roundtables/task force  meetings, one 
on E-governance and the other on Growth and Quality of Life,  the chairman's 
initiative. Thom Rubel and Joel Hirschhorn respectively  will contact you 
directly regarding Corporate Fellows executives' participation  in the 
roundtables. Also, the Natural Resources Committee is planning  to have a 
discussion on biotechnology. Diane Shea, committee director,  and I will be 
working together to identify Corporate Fellows to participate  in this 
committee meeting.  

New Corporate Fellows   

We are delighted to welcome the following Corporate Fellows to the program:   
DeVry Inc., Detroit  Edison, and Bull Information  Systems. If you are not 
already familiar with them, take a moment  and click on the company name to 
find out who they are and what they do.  

Corporate Fellow Participation in Recent  NGA Meetings  

Coinciding with the unveiling of the President's energy policy report,  NGA 
sponsored an all-day Energy Policy Forum on Friday, May 18,  to inform and 
educate state representatives and other interested parties.  

Panel discussions and presentations covered a range of perspectives on  a 
number of critical and timely issues, including:  

the states and energy policy;
crafting a comprehensive energy policy;
fuel sources and production infrastructure;
energy delivery;
demand management: efficiency, conservation and price responsiveness;  and
regulating the nation's energy markets: federal and state roles.

Corporate Fellow panelists included American Electric Power (AEP), Dupont,  
Enron and ExxonMobil. Other Energy Policy Forum panelists included 
representatives  from state organizations, electric utilities, energy 
conservation and  environmental advocacy and research organizations, several 
energy-related  trade associations and a commissioner of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory  Commission (FERC). The forum presented several points of view 
related  to current and projected domestic energy supply and demand, 
deregulation,  environmental concerns, the roles of federal and state 
governments, and  anticipated effects of new energy policies on states and 
consumers. 

We appreciate the time that AEP, Dupont, Enron and ExxonMobil took to  
participate to ensure the success of the Energy Policy Forum. Many, many  
thanks. 

We further appreciate the participation of Blue Cross Blue Shield in  our May 
24 meeting titled "Making Healthcare More Affordable and Accessible  for 
Small Businesses."

Estate Tax Provision Hits State Budgets Hard 
On the heels of the Senate passing the $1.35  trillion tax cut bill, state

On July 18, NGA will host the second in a series on privacy. The  topics for

you interested in attending, please send an email to Denise  Harrison. We

FYI in confidence for now, if you wouldn't mind. (For some reason Baumerich 
did not want to copy Paul H.) I can give you the background when we next 
speak. (Nailia, Bruno, Teun, Brendan and I are working on some interesting 
appointments/ events/ visits for you w/c 4 June.)

Subject: Re: REGULATORY AFFAIRS - BOY ARE WE IN TROUBLE  

Gregor, as discussed, I will call after my meeting with Rabensteiner this 
morning to discuss.  In general my assumptions and thoughts are as follows....

a) Medium term, we need to move in the direction of having local nationals - 
instead of AngloSaxons - as our
 lead face deep in the Germanic regulatory arena.  Styles & Hennemeyer will, 
no doubt, continue to have
 significant leadership roles; but, there is no substitute for locals.
b) As the markets get more liquid, especially as clearer national and 
regulatory bodies become established, the
 opportunity for RegAffairs value add increases - not decreases.  Greater 
liquidity and transparency will 
 increase the relative importance of transmission conditions.
c) Market concentration is a big problem and will get much bigger.  This will 
occupy a lot of time over the next few
 years.
d) Inevitably, some of the people we hire will go commercial, others will not 
work-out and others will leave Enron.
 If we try for 6 to 8, we will be lucky to get 3 or 4 by year end.  Of that, 
we will be lucky if 2 or 3 are successful
 RegAffairs people 2 years later.  It takes 2 years to grow our own top 
quality professional.  We are behind.
e) The gas market has only begun to move.  After a two year fight in that 
market we will then have to content with
 gas/power convergence which will introduce yet a new set of concentration 
and transmission and plant siting
 issues.
f) Historically, our RegAffairs people have been our most effective 
communicators in the public arena including
 the media.  As liquidity increases, the pressure to do deals will grow 
exponentially on commercial leads with
 the result that they will step further and further away from the public 
communicatioins arena.  But, particularly
 in Europe, we will continue for a long time to need to maintain a certain 
level of public profile.  Best done by
 a RegAffairs person rather than someone who should be out doing a deal.

I will call later this morning.  Thanks. John T.

I don't think we should make such an effort. Let's discuss.

Colleagues:

The first draft of the accomplishments for GA--including the section for the 
Southern Cone-- has been discussed with Rick and Jim this morning.   Entries 
for your group came only from JHaizmann, and PDawson.

The second draft is planned for Friday June 1st, and the final for June 8th.  
The week difference between 1st, and 8th will be spent entirely on  
addressing the appropriate methodologies to arrive at the dollar value for 
your work/accomplishment.  I promise that you--each for her/his 
accomplishments --shall be personally involved in determining the appropriate 
methodology so that to reflect your work in the most accurate manner.  
Accordingly, I would appreciate very much that all your accomplishments 
should reach me as soon as possible so that to allocate as much time for 
methodology and communication with you.  A report is currently being prepared 
of the compiled methodologies submitted so far and I shall send it you with 
the hope that it will be of help.

I also want to communicate that the process of sending your accomplishments 
is not really voluntary;  it is PRC related.  Therefore, I am really seeking 
your help and support to complete this task.  Perhaps the head of the Teams 
would like to ensure with the colleagues that all accomplishments are 
accounted for.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question or I can be of any 
help.

Subject: GA accomplishments for the period November 2000 - April 2001

Colleagues:

I am seeking your help to compile the accomplishments for GA during the 
period Nov 2000 - April 2001.  Of course, these accomplishments are the 
summation of your efforts either individually or through your group, and the 
total shall indicate the contribution of GA to the corporate objectives of 
Enron.  The aggregation of your inputs shall be one of the primary sources 
that Rick and Steve will use in communicating GA impact to all stakeholders 
in the company.  

I would like to suggest to use the attached excel file to document your 
accomplishment for the period.  I hope that it shall assist you to identify 
your contribution, your estimate of value, and a line, or two, explaining the 
methodology you used to arrive at your value.    

I hope to receive your inputs by  May 16th (next Wednesday), so that I can 
compile the inputs and issue the first draft for discussion by Monday 21st.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.
