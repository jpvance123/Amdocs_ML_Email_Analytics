John, Kevin, Jeff, and Steve,
After yesterday's Marketing Roundtable meeting, I have given further thought to the idea of interconnect services for customers that would bring lower costs by avoiding the contribution in aid of construction and possibly other markup fees that the pipelines are required to charge.

Attached is a strawman of how this might work.  

 

Please take a look at the document and "tear it apart."    The more vigorous your analysis the quicker we will know if this is a concept worth pursueing further.
Also, do any of you have a sample deal currently on the table that we could test this concept on?  

Best regards,
Sarabeth

Still concerned about this, so please give me one more shot.  I think it would be useful for NBPL to know about this project for the following reasons:

They already know generally what we're up to.

NBPL is looking at a lateral off Midwestern (their recent acquisition) across similar territory.

Apparently they have contacted certain potential shippers in the area.

Working "together" could add value to our effort, and it would preclude the possibility of two Enron companies contacting the same parties and stumbling over each other.

Some or much of the gas in the acquired PL could be sourced off Midwestern.

Therefore, I'm uncomfortable going forward without some sort of understanding with NBPL.  How about a simple confidentiality agreement, and in addition I can write a memo to NBPL that states how NNG would like to proceed with the project (something like the points below).  I realize that we cannot prevent NBPL from doing anything it wants to unless we make them more of a partner in the new PL, which we do not want to do at this time.

Let me know what you think.  I'm going forward on the project development regardless, but do want to deal with NBPL appropriately.

As we discussed, please pass this to Tony.  The following points included with confidentiality language should fit the bill.  Thanks.


NNG/NBPL Confidentiality Agreement and MOU

Describe project and BP pipelines (SSL, Woodriver - LaPlata).

Conversion of oil and product lines to natural gas service.

Targeting new markets - be general.

Anticipate interconnect with Midwestern PL as well as other pipelines.

Cooperate in the development of target markets, although each party is responsible for its respective pipeline.

NNG intends to purchase the BP pipelines.

A separate rate structure will be established for the purchased assets.

After conversion and service commencement, and for a period of 6 months, NNG agrees to negotiate exclusively with NBPL for the sale of NNG's pipeline system to NBPL.  Neither party is obligated to complete a transaction.

Below is a report generated by an analyst with ENA's West Power Desk in Portland that details the new generation projects for WSCC.
I plan to use this list as a target list for service clients.  Thought you might also want a copy for reference.

Kirk,
This is really dangerous... having a marketing guy talk to you about engineering matters.  However, since we've recently worked with our other power plants to get them up and running, the data is still pretty fresh.  If I'm speaking out of school here, my operations and/or engineering buddies will be quick to correct me.

At the proposed take-off point to your Big Sandy Project, flowing gas on TW is in the range of 850 - 900 psig.  We provide a minimum of 800 psig to the LDC's connected with us at the California border. 

Therefore, for purposes of your take-away lateral pipeline design, I'd say that 800 psig is probably a pretty good target number.  However, I must stress that the 800 psig is a flowing gas number, and would surely be impacted by how the gas is taken.  That is to say that TW may provide the 800 psig pressure if and only if all of the downstream operators folllow their schedules for delivery.  For example, none of our new power plants can simply ramp-up without giving TW ample notice of start-up and scheduling an appropriate quantity of gas.

We can get into more detail regarding the requirements for operating the Big Sandy delivery point and scheduling gas on TW to meet the plant's requirements at a later date.  Suffice it to say that a plant the size of the Big Sandy project presents some unique operating challenges to TW.   TW has but 1.1 Bcf/d of gas flowing westward.  Directly-connected gas turbines can quickly deplete TW's linepack.  However, that being said, we will do our best to work with Big Sandy as well as our other power plant partners to try and meet the loading requirements of the facilities.

My gas control coordinator is about go on his honeymoon during the middle 2 weeks of May.  We should think about having our meeting after he returns (after May 25?) so that we have not only our engineers, but the proper operations and gas control personnel present also.  Check you calendar and let me know what dates might work for you guys.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,
As a follow-up to my phone mail message of last Friday, I wanted to
verify for Tim's work, what the expected minimum inlet pressure would be
off of your pipeline, delivered into our proposed Project line (at the
proposed interconnect).

This information plays directly into the current engineering work that
he is leading.

Per your good suggestion, I also want to schedule a meeting to be held
in the next couple of weeks, in efforts to further our Project
interconnect discussion.

Thank you.
Kirk

Subject:	Recycle Line/Coolers

I talked with Arnold this afternoon and he confirmed the following:

1) Coolers were accounted for in the original cost estimate
2) Recycle line costs were not included in the original estimate.

Arnold hopes to provide a cost estimate of the recycle line per station as soon as he can.

I appreciate your input. please let me know if you require further information.

Ben

Subject:=09TW Expansion

There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the cl=
ose of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial tho=
ughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems. =20

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion=
? =20

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were cert=
ificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction i=
s that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an alter=
native to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements for =
the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are ex=
ecuted how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it =
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert=
. app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that g=
iven the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our abil=
ity to sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to =
sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contract=
s or a combination of both. =20

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options=
 (to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
=091.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (o=
r whatever number we decide on)
=092.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
=093.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
=094 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantl=
y this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels =
and fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for=
 1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve Stoj=
ic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated ra=
te options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach cou=
ld get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking ou=
r specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a=
 7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would =
be a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can t=
ell a customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by askin=
g for the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out=
 options of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this=
 is sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure. =20

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility =
do we have in structuring the options? =20

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose=
 to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want t=
o be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 a=
t $.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have =
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean =
we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a bet=
ter deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we deli=
berately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by off=
ering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and $.3=
5 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to =
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.           =20

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy i=
t the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, =
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d=
 of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 =
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who wan=
t option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That =
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand=
 first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else? =
 Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be=
 deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone =
may be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the=
 recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the=
 neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective nondi=
scriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh.=20

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answer=
ed already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are =
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your=
 convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get o=
ut and sell this stuff.  DF

Kevin,

Jo Williams said that you needed a quote for transportation from Mid 4 to Mid 3 in the Waha area.  On a firm basis we would be would in the $.02 to $.03 demand range plus minimum commodity.  For a TI rate use between $.035 and $.045.  If you would like primary to El Paso Waha, that rate would be a little higher.  We have been able to get additional value out of that interconnect because of the gas prices in California.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.

CA Settlement Stalls; Generator Construction on Track 
As work moved forward Tuesday on two new power sources to come on later this summer, the outlook in the immediate two months darkened with no apparent comprehensive solutions emerging from the state legislature. 
"The fact that there are several competing proposals in the legislature kind of indicates [the governor's] Memorandum of Understanding has some trouble," said Jerry Jordan, head of the Sacramento-based California Municipal Utilities Association. "Certainly if there is a [Southern California] Edison settlement we would hope to get paid out of that (as would the merchant generators)." 
AES received all of its final permits last week, and began construction this week on re-powering two generation units totaling 450 MW at its Huntington Beach facility in Orange County about 40 miles south of Los Angeles. Initial power supplies from the re-started and re-built units will begin in August, said Aaron Thomas, AES's San Francisco-based manager for California operations. 
Separately, Calpine Corp. on Tuesday announced that initial construction of 135 MW of peaking generation capacity will begin this week next to the company's existing Gilroy power plant in Gilroy, CA, an agriculture town not far from Calpine's San Jose headquarters. Upon completion of a two-phase build-out, the Gilroy Energy Center will be a 270 MW, natural gas-fired, simple cycle peaking generation facility. Commercial operation of phase one is scheduled for September 2001. An additional three 45 MW gas turbine generators will be installed in phase two, with full build out estimated for May 2002. 
No one thinks current efforts, not matter how accelerated, will avoid rolling blackouts, however. 
"There obviously is concern among some munis that they have adequate supplies, but are still asked to participate in rolling blackouts anyway (the 1 million-customers Sacramento Municipal Utility District is in that category)," said Jordan. "To the extent there is the possibility of bringing on emergency generators, that is being done. Everyone has done pretty much what they can do." 
Jordan noted that the public sector generators, like their private sector counterparts, need air quality restrictions waived temporarily so units that carry restricted hours of operations can be turned loose during summer peak demands to help avoid blackouts.

I've been thinking through how to approach power plant site development on a scale-able model and have outlined some thoughts below.  Please review - - - we can have a group discussion next week to plan the sequence of activities and resource requirments.

Concept

Develop large and small scale propane or gas fired power plant sites along ETS pipeline corridors and EOTT terminals.  

Rationale

Position ETS to capture growth in pipeline transportation services.

Position ETS or EOTT to capture natural gas liquids consumption for power generation.  

Establish ETS as a major merchant of sites suitable for the development of natural gas and propane fired power plants.

Position ETS to capture the role of power plant operator.

Position ETS to capture attractive equity returns on merchant power plant sites.

Approach

Identify legal and regulatory barriers to entry in states where ETS operates pipelines and EOTT operates terminals.  
Key success factors include-
- Open market state regulatory policies
- Competitive and open access to transmission and distribution networks
- Availability of air quality permits
- Ability to obtain building permits
- Ability to obtain operating permits and licenses

Identify commercial barriers to entry.
 Key success factors include-
- Demand for new generating capacity additions (growth in power demand, capacity replacements)
- Presences of competitors
	- New entrants
	- Recalcitrant incumbents

Develop quantitative  models to determine intrinsic merchant value of prospective sites that can be dynamically updated.
- Options on spark spreads
- Ancilliary services

Determine the cost associated with site development activities
- Site control
- Gas transportation costs from regional hubs
- Power transmission costs to regional hubs
- Network reinforcement costs
- Cost/benefit of plant cooling media
	- Once-through water cooled
	- Hybrid cooling
	- Air cooling
- Connection costs to critical interfaces
	- Pipeline/fuel terminals
	- Grid
	- Water
	- Sewage
	- Transportation (for construction crews, materials)
- Cost associated with local planning gain
- Cost of technical concept development
- Cost of environmental analysis
- Cost to determine socio-economic benefits
- Cost to obtain air quality permits
- Cost to obtain building permits
- Cost to obtain operating licenses and permits
- Cost to obtain ETS-provided operating agreements

Determine ways + means of monetising site values
- Sales to the trade
- Sales to private equity funds
- Hold as a B-O-O option for ETS

As we discussed, please pass this to Tony.  The following points included with confidentiality language should fit the bill.  Thanks.


NNG/NBPL Confidentiality Agreement and MOU

Describe project and BP pipelines (SSL, Woodriver - LaPlata).

Conversion of oil and product lines to natural gas service.

Targeting new markets - be general.

Anticipate interconnect with Midwestern PL as well as other pipelines.

Cooperate in the development of target markets, although each party is responsible for its respective pipeline.

NNG intends to purchase the BP pipelines.

A separate rate structure will be established for the purchased assets.

After conversion and service commencement, and for a period of 6 months, NNG agrees to negotiate exclusively with NBPL for the sale of NNG's pipeline system to NBPL.  Neither party is obligated to complete a transaction.

I quickly reviewed the Engelhard technology.
It may have some nice applications.  Here are the issues with this nitrogen rejection technology.
Adaptation of PSA technology, controls pore diameter (pd) at 3.7 A, and excludes methane which has a pd of 3.8 A and captures the nitrogen with a pd of 3.6 A.
Nice feature, there is only a 15 psi pressure drop between the feed gas and the product gas for this technology.
Issues
At low inlet pressures or low nitrogen concentrations the methane recovery can be as low as 80% unless a recycle system is utilized.  Then the recovery rate improves to greater than 90%.
As the inlet pressure increases, the recovery improves to 95+% but the recycle is approx. 15%.
PSA technology has operated at a 600 psig maximum pressure economically, since it uses many 300 ANSI flanges and valves.  Higher pressures are achievable, but the gas recoveries costs are required to be offset the higher cost of 600 ANSI valves and flanges.
The tail gas stream needs to have an economic home.  This stream operates in the 7 psia to 15 psia range and has a 300 Btu/scf.
If the feed gas has a high concentration of C3s and C4+ a pre treatment BPSA is required to extract the heavies for the nitrogen removal PSA.
Gas impurities like CO2 or H2S each require evaluation based on feed gas analysis. 
Engelhard claims for 300 to 800 psia operating range, it can deliver 4% nitrogen in the residue gas and will achieve a 97.5% methane recovery for 5% nitrogen stream and the recovery falls to 90% methane for a feed stream of 25% nitrogen.  This implies a recycle system is built into the design.
Alternative technologies:
Cryogenic separation
Absorption
and membrane units [good for crude separation]

Dennis Zitterkopf and I will be happy to review any stranded wells or other technologies.
Regards, Gene

Dennis, Gene
for your comments.     

Eric,		
We have looked in the past at various schemes for Bushton.   Dennis knows the entire system and the existing facilities at Bushton.

Subject:	RE: Nitrogen facility   

I have recently requested quotations from Engelhard Corporation for their new technology for nitrogen removal (www.engelhard.com).  Their process is new technology and have only a few units in production that is available for field inspection.  One unit is located in SW Colorado and reduces dehydrated gas from 18% to 3% N2.  The process is called the Molecular Gate System and uses a patented mole sieve absorbent process.  The process removes both nitrogen and CO2 with a pressure drop across the unit of approximately 15 psi.  Some methane is lost in the regeneration process and an enriched recycle stream high in C4+ will need to be recycled requiring a small compressor unit.  

Estimated costs excluding a recycle compressor are about $1.7MM for a 5MMcfd unit and $2.5MM for a 15 MMcfd unit.  Installation is not included in estimated costs but may vary between $100K to $200K for locations.

I am investigating this process further because I feel that the benefits of nitrogen removal in the Bushton Universe might prove to be economical with satelite installations versus a common point cryogenic plant considering that NNG is currently transporting 45 - 50 MMcf of N2 per day.  The removal of N2 would equate to lower O&M expenses on compression and higher heating values on the NNG system.  Both would help Enron realize higher revenue potential.

Thanks Earl for the info.  Eric Faucheaux is looking at some technology using cell membranes that may be much cheaper.  I gave him some gas sample info of volume near the Panhandle lateral that we may be able to do a test on.  Let's continue to keep each other posted.

Kevin / Rich

You had asked about nitrogen removal facilities for a customer and an order of magnitude dollar amount, which can vary due to the % of nitrogen in the gas stream, is $5,000,000 for a 10 mmcf/d facility. (this cost is without compression) There are several process available and to go any further down the road, we would need to contact the customer and get a gas quality and more information. To remove nitrogen, base on assumptions, it would require the removal of CO2, Glycol dehy for large water content, dry bed dehy for water fines and cyro for nitrogen removal + recompression to get it back to pipeline pressure. I don't think the producer would want to spend that amount of money for small volumes. 

If you would like for us to research any further, please let us know.

Thanks

Earl Chanley

Thanks Jeff - we would definitely like to meet with your team or
representatives on site as soon as possible.  I'd like to put you in touch
with Brett Hurlbut, our Senior Project Manager in the Four Corners.  He is
officed in Durango but lives in Farmington and could meet someone this week
with no problem.  He's already been over the pipeline route with Brett
Foutz, and of course we know the Blanco Hub area quite well.  Would someone
from your team be able to meet Brett this week in Bloomfield?  You can reach
Brett at the following:

Brett Hurlbut
Senior Project Manager
970-385-9100 ext 33
970-759-3572 (cell)
bhurlbut@trigon-sheehan.com

I've copied Brett on this message.  Brett - you can reach Jeff in Houston at
713-853-1521 or by email at jfawcet@enron.com.

Thanks everyone!

Information Request


Stu,
It was nice to meet you by telephone on Tuesday.  I don't have answers
to all your questions at this standing, but working with our Facility
Planners and Engineers, we should be able to get you the necessary
information pretty quickly.

I am the principal commercial contact for this project.  As a process
matter, Transwestern usually prefers to have the commercial
representative remain the primary point of contact for the project.
However, for matters relating to engineering and specifications of
facilities, that will be handled through our Facility Planners and
Engineers.  I don't know who will be your principal engineering contact
at this point, but we'll let you know as soon as possible.

As I mentioned over the telephone, we've done some preliminary work
relative to location of the proposed interconnect.  I'll have to check
with our San Juan team to see what was discussed.  It might be of some
value for our San Juan operations team and our engineers to meet you up
at the site location to kick this process off.  Let me know if you're
amenable to the idea, and what dates might work for you.

I look forward to working with you.

Jeff

Subject:	Needles Pressure Requirement


I've got a copy of the SoCal contract for Needles.  The exact wording for the pressure requirement is:

SECTION 5. PRESSURE. 

Seller shall tender gas to Buyer, at the delivery point on the California/Arizona border near Needles, California, at a pressure of not less than 750 PSIG, and not more than 1000 psiq, with an anticipated nominal operating pressure of approximately 800 psig, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. For purposes of this Service Agreement, pressure at the delivery point shall be calculated from actual readings at Seller's Needles measurement facility utilising generally accepted engineering formulas designed to calculate a pressure drop over a given distance of pipeline, gravity, temperature, and flow rate and other variables as may be reasonably necessary to make such computation, and may be confirmed by calculations at Buyer's North Needles Compressor station. 

It is my interpretation that our pressure requirement occurs exactly at the California/Arizona state line and we can use modeling methods to determine the required outlet pressure at the Needles station required to achieve 800 psig at the state line.

Steve,
In addition to Eric's questions below, I have an even more fundamental question, are the two scenarios (3 frame 6's, 2 frame 7's) additive or cummulative?  In other words, are we looking at planning on 130,000 lb/hr or 190,000 lb/hr?  Obviously, all these considerations make a difference in terms of design/cost.

-  is the 130,000 lb/h incremental to the 60,000 lb/hr for 3xGE6B or is 130,000lb/hr the new total?
-  is 130,000 lb/h for each unit  or times 2 for total of 260,000 lb/h?
-  is 130,000 lb/h rate the sum of 2 GE 7FA volumes and is this maximum the hourly rate not a sum divided by 24 hr?
-  what is minimum turndown flow rate?

I have tried to summarize where I think we are at this time.  Is anything else needed to move ahead in developing a recommendation for Phil?  If so, please let the rest of the group know immediately.  If not, can we tune up the estimates and run the other numbers by early next week?

I'll be back in the office Thursday.

Thanks!

SAN JUAN LATERAL
Capacity increase does not require increased takeaway capacity in CA as there is no mainline increase - we substitute San Juan gas for Permian gas
Has a relatively high probability of being accepted by OPS (my estimate - 90%)

MAOP Increases - 	1250 (75% SMYS) from Bloomfield to Bisti
			1330 (80% SMYS) from Bisti to Gallup

Advantica study, report and presentation - some portion of the $250,000 total (est. $75,000)
Minor, if any, additional inspection & testing

Compression additions	Either 4,000 hp at Bloomfield for 55 MMcf/d - $10 million
			Or    10,000 hp at Bisti          for 90 MMcf/d - $15 million

TOTAL (Bisti scenario)		90 MMcf/d		$15.1 million		($168,000/MMcf/d)



MAIN LINE
Capacity increase does require increased takeaway capacity in CA
Has a more moderate probability of being accepted by OPS (my estimate - 60%)

MAOP Increase - 1100 (79% SMYS) from Station 5 to Needles

Advantica study, report and presentation - balance of the $250,000

Inspection, including smart pigging, testing, material evaluation, valve replacement and High Consequence Area pipe replacement  - $33 million
Station 1 to Needles launcher and receiver										           $ 1 million

Compression additions	Red Rock  			150 MMcf/d  	$93 million	(works without the MAOP upgrade)
			10,000 hp each at Stations 1-4	250 MMcf/d	$60 million	(requires the MAOP upgrade)
			Total				400 MMcf/d	$153 million

TOTAL	(Red Rock + 1-4)	400 MMcf/d		$185 million		($463,000/MMcf/d)
TOTAL (Red Rock only)	150 MMcf/d		$127 million		($847,000/MMcf/d)
TOTAL (1-4 only)		250 MMcf/d		$  94 million		($376,000/MMcf/d)


These summarize the system optimization studies.  We would like Ben, Morgan, Perry Frazier, Earl Chanley and Kevin Hyatt to critically evaluate these scenarios, determine the economics, and provide the team and Phil with an overall feasibility evaluation.  If favorable, we can release Advantica to begin work and we can brief OPS on the overall plan and direction.

Upon further review of previous recommendations to install recycle and cooling at CS P-2 to provide greater turndown, it has been determined that the P-2 turbine has too much horsepower and has single stage wheeling that would not allow turndown less than its current minimum capacity of about 125 MMcfd.  Previous attempts by Operations to turndown the P-2 unit using the surge valve for recycle allowed approximately 100 MMcfd before reaching high discharge temperature, but high suction pressures were available from P-1 compression in a north flow scenario.

Volume analysis over the past year to date indicated volumes through P-3 of 100 MMcfd; thus, with 150 MMcfd proposed to be scheduled through the NNG Gray I/C, a balance of 50 MMcfd would have to flow south to P-2.  Throughput analyses were based upon needing to have P-2 turned down to a volume of at least 50 MMcfd.  Additionally, P-2 throughput analyses considered available pressures that would be available on NNG's KB line.  KB line pressures can be expected to get as low as 600 psig; therefore, pressure drop from the NNG Gray I/C to P-2 suction would yield P-2 suction pressures between 570 to 550 psig for low volumes of 50 to 80 MMcfd, respectively.  Required discharge pressures at these volumes would be 850 to 885 psig.  The P-2 single wheel stage will not handle a differential pressure of 270 to 335 psig.  P-2 is designed to handle differential pressures of 180-190 psig.

Re-wheeling the P-2 unit (3 stage) is not a viable option due to the operational flexibility that would be required to maintain Panhandle Lateral certificate capacity of 250 MMcfd.

Due to the pressure spreads that would be required to meet low flow demands, consideration was given to add additional reciprocating horsepower at P-2 to handle low flow demands without P-1 online.  50 MMcfd throughput at P-2 would require 1200 HP and 80 MMcfd would require 2100 HP at pressure differentials of 270 and 335 psig, respectively.  The cost of adding horsepower and piping modifications at P-2 is not a feasible option for accommodating NNG-Gray volumes.  Also new air emissions permitting and regulatory filing would be a greater concern compared to installing a new line as follows.

The most viable option would be to install a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, install approximately 1.75 miles of 16" from tap to P-3, and modify station yard piping for various control configurations.  The existing NNG-Gray measurement and control facilities would be relocated to the end of the new lateral and located inside P-3 plant boundaries.   This new tap, lateral and meter relocation option would provide the following benefits: 
1.	Receipt of 150-175 MMcfd
2.	Greater operational flexibility utilizing NNG/TW synergies
3.	Long-term operational reliability
4.	Greater horsepower utilization at single location
5.	Guarantee of receipt capacity from NNG regardless of low KB line pressure
6.	Possibility of free-flow capacity from NNG not requiring P-3 compression during winter times with NNG Pampa on-line, which could be possible at high or 	low flow conditions depending on TW pressures at Roswell (Sta. 9)
7.	Fractional increase of O&M expenses at P-3 compared to higher O&M expenses of adding horsepower at P-2

A level "A" cost estimate for installing a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, installing approximately 1.75 miles of 16" from tap to P-3, and modifying station yard piping for various control configurations would be $1,300,000.  Due to the complexity of configurations that P-3 is already capable of and introducing a new stream with various flow paths that may become possible, a field visit to the proposed construction sites would be recommended prior to submitting a Level "B" or "C" release.  See attached sketch for general route information proposed.

Moreover, the relocation of the NNG interconnect and installing the new lateral should create the opportunity for greater receipt volumes from NNG considering larger pipe and expanded I/C facilities because P-3 has plenty of available horsepower to utilize.  Actual conditions were provided by Operations from dates in the past where P-3 was actually compressing 370 MMcfd w/ units 3,4 & 5, Ps-599psig/Pd-874psig; also 265 MMcfd w/ units 2 & 5, Ps-540 psig/Pd-844 psig.  Depending on NNG conditions greater volumes than 150 MMcfd may be realized into TW having 250 MMcfd flowing south and additional volumes available to flow to Red Deer, Lefors and Cactus Laterals if needed.

I will be attending an offsite ETS Planning & Power Services department conference on Wednesday and Thursday.  Perhaps on Friday or early next week we should convene for further discussions via conference call with all interested parties call for direction of this proposal.  I will be checking my voice mail periodically for any comments and will call back during breaks if possible.  You may also send a text message to my pager at 8777270018@skytel.com.  EF 713/853-3395

Special thanks to Mansoor, Earl and Tony for your help with this matter!

	This is in response to your request of 3-26-2001 regarding the expansion of TW pipeline system in West Texas.
Current Facility Capacity Summary
Compression capacity at WT-1= 420 mmcf/d
Compression capacity at WT-2= 550 mmcf/d
Pipeline capacity from WT-1 to Station-9= 550 mmcf/d
Pipeline capacity from WT-2 to WT-1 flowing north= 250 mmcf/d ( when WT-1 operates at 950#).
Pipeline/ compression capacity at WT-2 flowing south 550 mmcf/d

Two scenarios have been considered in order to increase the capacity of WT-1 and WT-2 from 550
to 750 mmc/fd flowing north to Station  #9 and west to Station #8.

Scenario-1:
The following assumptions have been made for this scenario:
 
Gas supply availability                         
WT-1 	307 mmcf/d ( i.e.Atoka=150, Maljamar=45, GPM Zia=30 mmf/d 
                                                                                and Crawford =82 mmcf/d).                              
Elpaso				90 mmcf/d 
NGPL Eddy 				40 mmcf/d
>From WT-2 to WT-1 	          250 mmcf/d 									
Duke (WT-1 discharge)	            63 mmcf/d
Total				       750 mmc/d
Criteria used for hydraulic modeling were:
Suction pressure at WT-1          =615   psig
Zia pressure                                 =650   psig.
WT-1 discharge                           =950   psig.
WT-2 discharge                           =1030 psig.
Suction pressure at Station-9   =750   psig.
Station-8 Ps=725 psig and Pd  =1000 psig



Facility requirements and the associated costs ( level "A" release 30%?):
Loop the existing 24" (discharge side of WT-1) with 18.50 mi of 36". 	$20,000,000		
Add a 4000 hp booster unit on 36"/24" 23 miles north of WT-1. 		$5,000,000
Add a 4000 hp at Station-8 (current capa=590 mmcf/d). 			$5,000,000  

Total cost of scenario-1						         $30,000,000


Scenario-2:
Assumptions:
Available supply at WT-1			307 mmcf/d
NNG-Waha area to WT-2			443 mmcf/d 
Total					          750 mmcf/d	

Criteria used for hydraulic modeling were:
Suction pressure at WT-2 		= 710   psig.
NNG-Waha pressure 		= 870   psig.
Discharge pressure at WT-2 	= 1032 psig
Suction pressure at WT-1 		= 615   psig
Discharge pressure at WT-1 	= 900   psig
Suction pressure at Station-9 	= 735   psig
Sation-8 Ps=725 and Pd 		=1000  psig

Facility requirements and the associated costs ( level "A" release ?30%):

10 miles of 24" looped with 12"-Halley lateral and				$     800,000 
 interconnect facilities at TW/NNG Halley interconnect.	 			
10.44 miles of 30" looped with 24" discharge side of WT-2. 			$   9,000,000
Add a 6000 hp booster unit on 36"/24" 23 north of WT-1. 			$   7,500,000
18.50 miles of 36" looped with the existing 24" (WT-1 discharge)		$ 20,000,000
Add 4000 hp at Station-8 (current capa= 590 mmcf/d) 			$   5,000,000	

Total cost of scenario-2						        $42,300,000

Note:  This is a preliminary scope and cost estimate and no discussions on the facility specs were
           made to other internal or external units at this time.              

If you have any questions please call me at #33158.

Max,

As an alternative to replacing pipe can we consider applying Armour Plate wrap?

Subject:	Rough Estimate of Costs For Possible TW MAOP Upgrade - 30" Mainline & Loop Lines Sta 5 to Colorado River

As I will be out of town at Gallup NM this week for the excavations planned for TW L-154 line, I will will miss the the meeting on the 10th.

I have begun preparation of a cost estimate for the above, given it is very rough and I am awaiting information from Facility Planning which should fine tune some of these numbers.  As we do not know exactly what we will plan to do at this time, this is just a best guess but gives a reference of what might be expected.

As can be seen, replacement of the mainline valves and replacement costs for the Class 3 pipe are the highest drivers.  We are still uncertain whether the valves on the launchers and receivers are rated for 1008 psig and have not been included at this time for replacement.  I will check on this while in the Gallup area.  All of the valves requiring replacment will have some salvage and reuse value for potential use on other pipeline systems in ETS that will need to be converted to being smart piggable in the future I am quite sure.  If there are other alternatives later defined in lieu of pipe replacment for class 3 pipe, this would also drive this cost down.

Anyway, it's a start.

Oops . . . forgot to include you on the distribution.  FYI - I reduced the probabilities on several projects - - - we should probably discuss how to assign going forward so that everybody is singing off the same sheet of music.

A questions was raised in last Friday's meeting regarding the impact of a fuel tracker to the TW Expansion economics.  Based on a fuel tracker starting in the six year of the project the DCF changes from 14.47% to 13.71% over the 15 year project life.

If you have any other question, please let me know.

I've attached (admittedly incomplete) the Project Check List for a proposed gas-fired electric generation plant to be located off TW and EPNG near Belen, N.M.  The customer has requested that TW provide an estimate to construct an interconnect with both TW and EPNG and to build the lateral pipeline facility to their plant site.  I've attached below a copy of the email I received yesterday from Steve Rutherford requesting this estimate.  This project (at least as far as TW is concerned) is in its earliest stage of development.  However, in order to proceed, the customer would like a (+/- 30%) estimate from TW in order to factor in the interconnects/lateral costs into its economics.  On a parallel path, I'll be working on the deal structure with the customer to provide adequate payback and return of investment in the facility, along with operating costs and return.

Please provide me a timetable for getting an estimate out to this customer.  I know they asked for next Monday, but I've already sent them a note indicating it might take a bit longer.  Also, if you need additional information in order to provide this estimate, please don't hesitate to contact Steve Rutherford directly.  I'd only ask that if you email him, you'd copy me on the email for my files.  Thanks.

Got it.  I don't know whether the 1/29/01 date for an estimate is do-able or not, I'll need to check with the engineers and their work load.  I'll let you know as soon as I find out when we can get it back to you, but expect it shortly, if not by next Monday.  Thanks.

Rod Hayslett and I met with Kinder Morgan on 4/25 to discuss the possible commercial structures under which Enron and Kinder could jointly develop, construct and operate the proposed Hueco Pipeline Project to serve Pemex.  Because the meeting was the first of a series aimed at identifying and agreeing on structuring, no concrete decisions were reached.  However, a number of issues were identified and discussed:

1.   Relative ownership in the Project?  Both Enron and Kinder agree on a 50/50 split.
2.	Who operates?  Enron and Kinder both expressed a strong desire to have "business operation" rights, i.e. gas control, contract admin., marketing, etc.  Rod suggested that the impasse might be broken vis-?-vis the creation of a separate operating entity, which would be free to contract services from the parent companies.  Alternatively, either company might bid for the right to provide these services to the new pipeline.  Further negotiations on this issue are needed.
3.	What type of corporate entity?  Both Enron and Kinder thought the deal looked like an ideal candidate to drop into a LLC.  Moreover, Kinder noted an interest in possibility creating a MLP for their side of the investment.  No decisions were reached, but it was agreed that both companies probably were probably aligned with respect to cash flow and tax considerations.
4.	Rate issues.  Rod suggested that the parties consider "leasing" capacity to Pemex instead of filing a more conventional application for a FERC rate for firm carriage.  Rod believes there may financial and/or process advantages to this approach, and will attempt to classify and quantify same.
5.	Form of Commitment.  Both Enron and Kinder agreed that Pemex must be willing to execute a firm binding contract for a quantity of capacity (either under lease or under firm, one-part rates) sufficient to earn a reasonable rate of return.  Independently, each party had earlier discussed with Pemex a minimum term of at least 15 years.  Enron and Kinder talked about the use of 15% as an appropriate hurdle rate for investment.
6.	Project Financing.  Rod suggested that once the project has taken root, the parties should consider involving Mexican banks for financing.  With contracts and non-recourse financing from Mexico, presumably, there would be no currency risk to manage.
7.	Engineering/Design work.  Enron has agreed to do the preliminary design, mapping and [order of magnitude] cost estimation work.  Enron has committed to meeting with its NGPL counterparts next week (Tues., or Wed.) to go over design assumptions and final location of interconnection facilities.
8.	Next Commercial meeting.  NGPL and Enron will talk by telephone on Monday to see if internal meetings have yielded progress on the issues of facility operations and possible forms of business structuring.
9.	Joint Presentation to Pemex.  Assuming Enron and NGPL are able to reach tentative agreement on the construct of a joint partnership for the project, both parties will make a presentation of their findings and offer a joint proposal to Pemex.  The Pemex meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 23 in Mexico City.

Rod, will you and Danny and/or Steve Harris brief Stan on this project during Monday's staff meeting?  

Morgan, will you confirm that you and Eric are prepared to meet with NGPL by Wed. next week to discuss design assumptions and location of interconnects?

Thanks.

Jeff

Subject:	TW Expansion OH Rate

Based on conversations between Earl Chanley and Jim Saunders, the Overhead rates for major projects to be applied to the TW expansion estimates are to be 2% of the capital estimate in lieu of the 11% in the current estimates or 15% in the current procedure for 2001.

This in mind, the NEW estimate totals are:

Option 1

I've got a copy of the SoCal contract for Needles.  The exact wording for the pressure requirement is:

SECTION 5. PRESSURE. 

Seller shall tender gas to Buyer, at the delivery point on the California/Arizona border near Needles, California, at a pressure of not less than 750 PSIG, and not more than 1000 psiq, with an anticipated nominal operating pressure of approximately 800 psig, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. For purposes of this Service Agreement, pressure at the delivery point shall be calculated from actual readings at Seller's Needles measurement facility utilising generally accepted engineering formulas designed to calculate a pressure drop over a given distance of pipeline, gravity, temperature, and flow rate and other variables as may be reasonably necessary to make such computation, and may be confirmed by calculations at Buyer's North Needles Compressor station. 

It is my interpretation that our pressure requirement occurs exactly at the California/Arizona state line and we can use modeling methods to determine the required outlet pressure at the Needles station required to achieve 800 psig at the state line.

Subject:	TW lateral pipe sale

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.


Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)


Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

I have reviewed the interconnect (K#7033) and transport agreements (K#20822) with Citizens Utility.  Under the interconnect agreement, Citizens has to be able to take a min. and max pressure of 600-1000 psig from TW.  The good news is as follows:

	Citizens has amended their transport volume for the Flagstaff point (poi# 500134) to 2,000/MMBtu/d effective 6/01 - 10/01 and only 5,000/d from 11/01 - 2/07.  This is a significant reduction over what they took thru the point for the winter months Oct '00 thru Mar'01.  

What this means to TW/ENA is there appears to be capacity available today thru the Flagstaff lateral that would serve the generation plant being proposed by EES.  So any volume TW delivers for EES, up to the capacity max on the lateral (25,000/d), should not impare deliveries to Citizens.  

I have a question for Fac. Planning: does the Flagstaff N.E. POI# 500046 lie on the same lateral?  If it does, then Citizens has 1,990 MMBtu/d for 6/01 - 10/01 and 2,950 MMBtu/d for 11/01 - 2/07 also contracted and we have to keep this in mind as the look at the volume EES may need.  

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject:	FW: Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect

Gale, here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect.  The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.  
 
The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below:
 << File: MN9213_daily_vol.xls >> 

   


Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral?

Subject:	Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect

Eric, I'm going to try an provide the info requested this morning.  This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions. 

The following are the details as I understand it:
The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.  

We have approximately 7 miles of 6" lateral from Transwesterns 30" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)  

I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.  (Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station 2 & 3, I would assume)  

Flow Capacity Info for a 4" Auto Adjust Turbine Meter:

Pressure               Max Flow Rate
600#                                  19,920 mscfd     
700#                                  23,540 mscfd
800#                                  27,310 mscfd
900#                                  31,200 mscfd
The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated

I hope this answered some of your questions.  It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning, System Ops, Marketing, Engineering and Operations to discuss the details........

I got this form agreement from Jeff.  It was prepared recently for PEMEX.  I understand it was approved for general use by Susan.  All I've done so far is change the names of the Parties and change the description of the purpose and asked Steve for comments on these questions:

	1.  TW or ETS?  Steve would like this to be as broad as possible, but ETS probably isn't a legal entity that can enter into contracts.  When we looked at TransColorado, we used Enron Pipeline Company.  Stan is an officer and can execute documents for EPC.  Steve wanted the Party defined to be broad so that it could encompass several possible entities on Enron's part.

	2.  Is the "purpose" appropriate per the discussions Steve had with Questar?  Steve said that the agreement should express the intent to evaluate for a partnership interest, possibly operating the Southern Trail facilities and/or purchasing a portion of Southern Trails.  Again, in any event, to be broad in this description.

I was going to discuss these points with Legal and get a final blessing and send over to Gary Schmitt (his e:mail is garysc@questar.com)

Kevin,

Thanks for the clarification.  Can you tell me if the following assumptions are correct for your pricing?

1.	Minimum volume transported is 0, maximum is 200,000/day
2.	365 days / year for 2 years

Thanks for your help.

I work with Ned Higgins in Enron Compression Services.  He informed me of some transportation quotes that you had given to him for FT from Mid 4 to Mid 3, as well as IT to El Paso Waha.  Can you please tell me if there are any minimum or maximum volumetric requirements under these prices, and the term that your pricing applies to?

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Eric,

We are getting with Enron Research to help us value the storage portion of the proposal.  Will hopefully know soon.

Thanks, kent

Kevin,

Here are the rates that we came up with.  Please keep in mind that we may not have 200,000/d available capacity at certain interconnects.  Also, because of the California problems, we have been able to extract additional value for volumes delivered to El Paso Waha.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Kevin,

Jo Williams said that you needed a quote for transportation from Mid 4 to Mid 3 in the Waha area.  On a firm basis we would be would in the $.02 to $.03 demand range plus minimum commodity.  For a TI rate use between $.035 and $.045.  If you would like primary to El Paso Waha, that rate would be a little higher.  We have been able to get additional value out of that interconnect because of the gas prices in California.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Here is a revised version of the Red Rock agreement which includes changes suggested by Jeff.  If you've already sent the previous version to shippers, that is perfectly fine, as Jeff's changes should be noncontroversial.  We've just removed the reference to the service request as service requests will be submitted along with each shipper's bid rather than executed simultaneously with the agreement.  This new version more accurately reflects the contracting process for this expansion.

Kevin,

Thanks for the update on Pacer.  Just like Southern Trails, I'd like to see bible on Pacer.  Basically, I'm interested in getting our thoughts together in a @DASH@-like format - - - this is a good outline for thinking through complex deals.  Headline topics are-

Transaction description
Rationale
Valuation
Risks
Risk mitigants

At this stage, I don't need an exhaustive analysis - - - we just need enough information to progress further discussions with BP.  As ever, we will need inputs from legal, finance, tax, accounting, ops, and regulatory.  On the presumption that we want to move forward with further discussions, please have Chuck fix an appointment with BP asap.  Julie has my calendar but I will be available 16-23 May

Gale, here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect.  The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.  
 
The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below:
 

  


Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral?

Subject:	Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect

Eric, I'm going to try an provide the info requested this morning.  This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions. 

The following are the details as I understand it:
The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.  

We have approximately 7 miles of 6" lateral from Transwesterns 30" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)  

I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.  (Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station 2 & 3, I would assume)  

Flow Capacity Info for a 4" Auto Adjust Turbine Meter:

Pressure               Max Flow Rate
600#                                  19,920 mscfd     
700#                                  23,540 mscfd
800#                                  27,310 mscfd
900#                                  31,200 mscfd
The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated

I hope this answered some of your questions.  It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning, System Ops, Marketing, Engineering and Operations to discuss the details........

Hi John,

We spoke earlier this morning about obtaining the value of storage assets owned by ETS/NNG.  Specifically, I would like to have information on the:

Original cost of the assets
Cost as in the rate base
Replacement cost
Current Value
Depreciation (schedule, method, etc.)
Cost Allocation
Rate Design
Age of the Asset 
Expected remaining life of the assets

and if possible the cost and revenue by location.  As far as the time frame, we would like to have the information by the end of the week, however considering your move to Three Allen Center on Friday that may not be feasible.  Instead, after initially looking into this, maybe you can give me an estimated time frame as to when you can gather this information.

I will contact Bob Chandler this afternoon and see if he can assist me in obtaining NNG financial statements and any other infomation on ETS/NNG's storage assets.

Thank you,

E. Mike Gelin

Steve: I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and would be glad to assist you in your storage research activities. From our meeting on Tuesday, I have the following notes which the information listed below has some historical value:

Continue to focus on the Crystal River/Arizona salt cavern storage project,  I would hope at some time I would have the opportunity to meet technical personnel involved in the development to get a better idea of any unusual or extraordinary costs associated with development in Arizona
Try to understand why SoCal is abandoning the Montebello Field in California
Try to determine reasonable reservoir quality rock for storage of natural gas in or near Las Vegas, Nevada.

I will attempt to get some information to you relatively soon although, I am in Wichita next week prior to Thanksgiving.

Again, it is enjoyable to have the opportunity to work with you.

Regards,

Maurice

Maurice, thanks for the reply.  At this point Enron is only an interested party.  The facility is being developed by Crystal Gas (El Paso subsidiary), AZ Public Service, and Gas de France.  We would certainly like to see it move forward as it would be a delivery point for our new pipeline.  I'm just trying to get a handle on whether the project is for real or not.

Kevin: Thanks for the information and 5000 feet of halite if it is one uniform bed is certainly similar to Gulf Coast salt domal opportunities.   If you decide to move forward with this effort, issues of water can be evaluated based upon Arizona rules and regulations for fresh water use and salt water disposal.  I have spoken with Morgan regarding a  Fall 2001 Meeting, 7-10 October, 2001, Albuquerque, NM, USA of the Solution Mining Research Institute which might have some information regarding developing salt storage in Arizona.
I would certainly like to support your efforts as you move forward.

Below are the answers to your questions regarding the proposed Crystal Gas salt cavern storage for the west side of Phoenix.  After you have reviewed the answers, I would be interested to hear your opinion / comments regarding the feasibility of the storage facility.  If the cavern does not get built, we will likely change some of our plans regarding the Sun Devil pipeline project.

Dennis: some questions regarding salt storage:

Is the salt layer, bedded or domal? [Hyatt, Kevin]   Bedded 
What is the thickness of the salt layer at the development site? [Hyatt, Kevin]   over 5000 feet 
What is the chemistry of the salt, i.e. is the salt halite, gypsum/anhydrite calcium sulfate), sodium sulfate [Hyatt, Kevin]   95 -99% halite 
Has any drilling been done at the site, coring, rock mechanics evaluation? [Hyatt, Kevin]    
Are any geological reports available for the site? [Hyatt, Kevin]    Test wells have been drilled.  I'm not confident I can get report copies. 
What restrictions exist (rules and regulations) regarding storage development in Arizona? [Hyatt, Kevin]   water & water disposal 
What is the availability for water to solution mine the a cavern? [Hyatt, Kevin]   water is available, disposal of the brine solution will be an issue 

Just a few thoughts, I apologize that I cannot be with you on Wed. and if I need to travel to Arizona to meet with technical staff, I certainly can make arrangements after my trip to Wichita next week.

Regards,

Maurice

[Hyatt, Kevin]  
The storage cavern will be built in 3 phases, 3.3 Bcf working gas per phase, 330mmcfd withdrawal, 165mmcfd injection
30 day / 12 turn capability.

Compression will likely be 8-9000 hp per cavern (electric units).  Leaching time will be 1-2 years.  Brine disposal test scheduled for November.  There is a Morton Salt  plant adjacent to the cavern site.  Morton will likely take some of the brine, but not enough (too much salt will depress the maket price for the commodity).  First cavern to be available late 2004 / early 2005, 2nd cavern late 2006.

Gentlemen,
In addition to looking for ways in which Transwestern can improve mainline deliverability, another important criteria is access to markets.  With the addition of the Calpine South Point project, we have delivery point capacity off the Topock Lateral approaching 1 Bcf/d.  However, we are currently limited to 400,000 Dth/d of capacity in the Topock Lateral itself.  Steve has asked us to look at what facilities/costs would be involved in increasing the deliverability of the Topock Lateral (no mainline capacity additions are implied, beyond the addition of Red Rock).

What would be the best/cheapest capacity additions we could make with respect to the Topock Lateral?  Drawing on my vast engineering expertise (ha,ha), it seems to me that with the directly connected power plant located approx. midway along the lateral line, wouldn't a compressor station immediately upstream of Calpine offer us the dual benefit of not only increased lateral capacity, but additional operating flexibility to meet the load curves for the plant?  Anyway, you guys are the experts, but we're asking that you look at a few cases and sketch out the associated costs of increasing the Topock Lateral capacity.  By way of suggested guidelines, I'd say that we'd like to see cases that provide for not less than 50 MMcf/d of incremental capacity, and not more than a doubling of the current line capacity (400 MMcf/d).  Again, its a cost/benefit sort of analysis, so we're really looking to key in on the cheapest, most economical capacity addition.

James, would you remain plugged in here, and given the information that Eric and/or Ben may provide, be prepared to give us some rate implications for this capacity addition?

Unless this creates too big a burden on your existing schedule of projects, can we set a deadline of March 30th with some Topock Lateral expansion cases along with costs/rates implications?  Please let me know.  If you need help with assumptions and/or need additional information, please give me a shout.  Thanks.

Steve,
I spoke with Eric this morning.  He'll continue to work on documenting the estimate, and to prepare maps and a schematic of the proposed facilities.  This will be necessary down the road not only for your files but for purposes of selling El Paso on the joint operation protocol/procedures.  We'll also need the project engineers to verify the assumptions/design criteria for the facilities to assure adequacy of service to both phases of the project.

Eric and his crew are working on a couple of other pretty important projects this week and most likely won't have a chance to complete the aforementioned documentation and mapping until late next week.  Either Eric or I will give you an update next week.   Likewise, we'd appreciate it if you could keep us advised of the progress you guys make on the development of this project.  

We definitely appreciate working with you on this deal.

	Capital Budget Code (Talk to Palu Goradia)
	On the back, input however many dollars you want to be posted for this project - into the correct category - usually under Engineering

	E-Mail the completed form to me and I will have it input into SAP before anything else can be done with it.

	Once a number is assigned, the PA will be returned to Marketing for signatures.

	Kevin, I believe you will find that getting the Planners to "gin up" the initial study PA's might speed things up in the future.  

	Here is the form - save a clean copy of it for future use - okay?  And, each time, the above must be completed.

El Paso's proceeding relating to capacity allocation/constraints was stricken from the agenda today at the last minute - wasn't on any information even just prior to the meeting. (RP00-336). 
A draft order was released in the PUC v. El Paso proceeding in which FERC remanded to the ALJ for a limited supplemental hearing on the issue of whether El Paso made all of its capacity available to shippers at its California delivery points in the period of Nov. 2000 - March 2001. (RP00-241). We will probably have this later today.
There has been an order issued in San Diego Gas v. Sellers of Energy which we will have later today - will also send to you.

Will this interconnect actually be with the jointly-owned Blanco Hub facilities (or just in the area of the Blanco Hub)?  If we are connecting with the Blanco Hub, we need to notify the owners (PNM & NWPL) of an expansion/addition to the facilities and see if they want to participate, etc.  We might need to discuss the Blanco Hub agreements as they pertain to the operating pressure commitments.  When he asks about the volumes available at different points at the Hub, is he talking about receipt point capacity or supply availability?  Let me know when you have time to discuss.

Thanks,
Lindy

Information Request


Stu,
It was nice to meet you by telephone on Tuesday.  I don't have answers
to all your questions at this standing, but working with our Facility
Planners and Engineers, we should be able to get you the necessary
information pretty quickly.

I am the principal commercial contact for this project.  As a process
matter, Transwestern usually prefers to have the commercial
representative remain the primary point of contact for the project.
However, for matters relating to engineering and specifications of
facilities, that will be handled through our Facility Planners and
Engineers.  I don't know who will be your principal engineering contact
at this point, but we'll let you know as soon as possible.

As I mentioned over the telephone, we've done some preliminary work
relative to location of the proposed interconnect.  I'll have to check
with our San Juan team to see what was discussed.  It might be of some
value for our San Juan operations team and our engineers to meet you up
at the site location to kick this process off.  Let me know if you're
amenable to the idea, and what dates might work for you.

I look forward to working with you.

Jeff

Kevin,
Please accept my apology for not meeting with you while you were in
Bloomfield. Jeff Fawcett explained that he wasn't coming and that you were
coming
instead. Michael Mack the president of Ameramex and I were both eager to
meet with you. We were there for the entire meeting but we did not realize
that you were there. The first that I learned that you were at the meeting
was when I received a copy of the email to you from Brian O'Hare, our
consultant.

I had explained that you might be attending and that you and I had never
met. Needless to say, I am embarrassed and utterly astonished that Brian did
not point you out to me or point me out to you.

Once again, I apologize for us being so disjointed and for missing the
opportunity to meet you personally and discuss some of the issues that Jeff
and I have been discussing.

I appreciate you taking the time to come to Bloomfield and look forward to
meeting you some time in the near future.

Thank You,
Richard L. Moore

Kevin, per our phone conversation this morning...  this is the info I sent to Eric a couple of weeks ago.   With regards on the meter station capcity requirements as changed per any amendments to the Operating Agreements, I would sure be interested in getting a copy if you have a chane to provide one.    I would assume a 50 MW facility would require approximately 12 to 15 mmcfd.....  Depending on fuel rates.....

Subject:	Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect

Eric, I'm going to try an provide the info requested this morning.  This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions. 

The following are the details as I understand it:
The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.  

We have approximately 7 miles of 6" lateral from Transwesterns 30" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediatily on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)  

I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.  (Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station 2 & 3, I would assume)  

Flow Capacity Info for a 4" Auto Adjust Turbine Meter:

Pressure               Max Flow Rate
600#                                  19,920 mscfd     
700#                                  23,540 mscfd
800#                                  27,310 mscfd
900#                                  31,200 mscfd
The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated

I hope this answered some of your questions.  It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning, System Ops, Marketing, Engineering and Operations to discuss the details........

Kirk Ketcherside with IGI Resources, Inc. (see website for info on company http://www.igires.com/index.html) called to say that IGI was taking over the gas procurement side of the Caithness Big Sandy Project.  The project has now decided to own and separately contract for the construction of the 40 mile lateral pipeline to connect TW (and others) to the project site near Wickieup, AZ.

Kirk has requested that TW provide an estimate for the cost of the interconnect and meter station only (with appropriate control devices, flow, pressure, etc.).  When I reminded Kirk that EPNG probably delivers at a pressure 150 psig lower than TW's, he asked that we include a pressure letdown device in our estimate in order to be able to commingle with EPNG.

Eric, since we have the vast majority of this work has already been done by Earl and Ron, I told him we could probably get back to him with an estimate by early-mid next week.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

The attached files are the analysis of Option 1 and Option 2 for the TW Expansion.  The analysis for Option 2 was not adjusted for the lost revenue, but the attached file reflects the range of revenue that will be impacted by the overhauls of the existing units.  The following assumption were used for each option.
If you need to print the analysis for 140 or 150 expansion, you only need to print the first 8 pages of the workbook.

Option #1 - Install RB211 at Station #1 thru #4

Volume:  150 MMcf/day
Transport Rate Used: $.3677
Capital Investments: $99.6MM
Capital Estimate:+-10%
Operating Cost of Existing Units: $85/HP
Btu/HPHR: 7000
Operating Cost of New Units: $35/HP
Btu/HPHR: 7300
Design Rated HP: 152,000HP
Site Rated HP: 99,100
Required HP: 80,150
Incremental HP: 30650
Retainage: 5%
Load Factor: 85% Mean Average - Standard Deviation = 5%
Existing Units will be abandon in place.
Ad Valorem Tax will be the same for either option.

Option #2 - Install Nuovo Pignones at Station #1 thru #4

Volume:  140 MMcf/day
Transport Rate Used: $.3677
Capital Investments: $68,8MM
Capital Estimate:+-10%
Operating Cost of Existing Units: $85/HP
Btu/HPHR: 7000
Operating Cost of New Units: $35/HP
Btu/HPHR: 8000
Design Rated HP: 62,800HP
Site Rated HP: 41,200
Required HP: 30,000
Retainage: 5%
Load Factor: 85% Mean Average - Standard Deviation = 5%
Ad Valorem Tax will be the same for either option.
Overhaul Revenue Lost Range  for 90 Days of downtime ($1.6MM to $3.9MM) Note: Not included in IRR!

Option #1 IRR (13.46%) and Option #2 IRR(15.86%).  Both project can be structured to fit current rate structure or a negotiated rate structure by adjusting O&M assumptions and debt/equity ratios.


I will be out of the office Wednesday afternoon thru Friday.  If you have any questions, please call me at Ext 35028 or at home 281-356-6089.

Thanks, Bret -- that's helpful.  Let me be clear, however.  There will most likely be no (firm) transportation contract in association with this project.  Like the other two power plant projects we put in last year, we will work out a Facility Construction (and/or) Operations Agreement that will set forth the mechanism by which TW will be reimbursed for its expenses (capital and O&M).  I've asked the San Juan Team to look at the possible routing with an eye towards underlying ownerships and ease of right-of-way.  They'll be working with facility planning (Ron Matthews) to put their recommendations into a revised drawing and estimate, if necessary.  We'll keep you guys posted.  Thanks again.

Jeff,

The current project fits within the FERC's new regulations under the Automatic Blanket requirements since the project scope is to build a new delivery point, potential branchline and costs will not exceed the current authorized level of $7.3 million and is not a by-pass of an existing customer.  There are several issues that need to be completed before construction can begin:  An executed transportation contract, Landowner notification and Environmental clearances.  Please keep us informed as the project progresses to make sure all the FERC requirements are met before the construction begins.  

Thanks
Bret

Subject:	Ameramex Project- Bloomfield

Keith,
Ron's note pretty well summed it up.  Sorry my earlier correspondence didn't speak clearly enough to these issues.  This is a new electric generation plant.  It doesn't necessarily fall into any existing utility service area, as far as I know.  If anything, it might fall into the City of Famrmington's muni gas service.  However, if the City of Farmington is funding the plant (including  the cost of the interconnect) through muni bonds, it's doubtful they'll have any problem with the source of supply.

I'm interested in the theory that would necessitate our receiving prior permission to interconnect with a direct end-use customer in any area, uncontested or otherwise.  They'll be building the lateral line (or we'll build it, but they own it).  All we're really doing here is the delivery point.  I understood this situation fits within the FERC's new guidelines for construction of such facilities, and would not require a prior notice filing.

Let me know what additional information you might need.

Ameramex Energy Farm Project will be a new facility with no current supplier.  The location is approximately 0.75 miles southeast of the Bloomfield station.  The load would be served form the San Juan Hub and would not effect firm capacity through Bloomfield.  If you need any details from a Marketing perspective, please call Jeff Fawcett.

Ron, is this a new plant?  Or is it existing?  If it is an existing plant, is it being served presently?  If it is receiving service, by who?  If this is a by-pass, we will need to file a Prior Notice or obtain a signature from the group serving the load agreeing to the by-pass.

Please let Bret know what the situation is.

Subject:	Ameramex Project- Bloomfield

Rick Moore with Ameramex called and said their project is moving forward- on a fairly expedited basis.  They've recently obtained a City of Farmington pledge of public funds (a precursor to a formal bond issue) to underpin the financing. 

To refresh your memory, this project is another "trigeneration" project.  Ameramex will use the waste steam from the electric generation turbines to heat a hydroponic lettuce farm, as well as use the combustion carbon dioxide.  We've previously provided a route map and estimate (0.75 mi. of 4" pipe, $486K direct/indirect cost) to Ameramex.

Ameramex's financing deal is now dependent upon completion of the interconnect and commencement of service in approx. 7 months.  To this end, Ameramax has requested a walk through of the potential route and a revised (if necessary) estimate of the cost to interconnect.  There are several other issues to be dealt with here, including what is the final deal structure; including whether TW may possibly providing interim financing until the issuance of the muni bonds.

Rick Moore would like to get together with myself and representatives of operations and/or engineering to survey the route and decide on the ultimate design/configuration of facilities.  Depending on the outcome of the survey, he'd like a formal proposal for TW for financing the construction of the lateral and interconnect facilities.

Ron, since you provided all the prior facility planning support, I'd like for you to continue providing the liason support to TW Commercial on this project.  I'll also be calling on the San Juan Team to work with you and engineering to optimize the design/routing of this interconnect/lateral pipeline.  I'll work with the customer to set-up a site meeting when you return to work after 2/5/01.

To bring you and others up to speed, I've included a couple of the original email(s) giving a little more detail on the estimate and a map of the route:

Subject:	Amerimex Energy Farms Project

Jeff,

I talked with the San Juan team and came up with a pipeline route to the proposed Energy Farms site located in S1/2  SE1/4  Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, and the NE1/2  NE1/4 Sec. 24, T29N, R11W all in San Juan County, NM.  Per the correspondence, Energy Farms is looking at a delivery around 15 MMcf/d.  The best approach to serving this load would be to take gas from the suction side of Bloomfield CS.  The 4" pipeline would start there a travel about 0.75 miles to the northwest section of the proposed site (see attached map).  A metering facility would be located at the beginning of the pipeline still inside of TW's property along with the other meter facilities.  Below is a breakdown of the facility cost.  Estimated costs are + 30% and would have to be refined.  

0.75 miles of 4" pipeline & side valve		$286,500

4" orifice meter run w/ gallagher flow 		$199,900
conditioner, & flow control

						$486,400


There is a possibility that the meter facility costs could be lower by using an existing metering header system but a more detailed review would be required.  Please feel free to call if you have any questions.  I will send you a copy of the estimated costs for both the pipeline and measurement since they can't be attached.

Subject:	Amerimex Bloomfield Project

Attached see a note I sent to Rick Moore.  Rick works for a company called Amerimex.  Rick and I worked together in gas supply at EPNG ("the early years").  Amerimex is a developer of "trigeneration" projects.  In addition to the subject project for Bloomfield, another one is being considered for Santa Theresa, N.M.  If you recall, we were introduced to trigeneration when we were discussing an electric generation plant on the site of a hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup.

Trigeneration is an environmentally friendly technology that utilizes the "byproducts" of electric generation.  "Cogeneration" refers to the process where waste heat/steam generated during the combustion of gas turbines is sold commercially (usually to manufacturing facilities) for plant purposes.  "Trigeneration," on the other hand, refers the process where not only is the waste heat/steam utilized, but also the carbon dioxide.  Therefore, trigeneration is a perfect fit for a greenhouse that requires both heat and carbon dioxide for the plants.

Amerimex has proposed a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse in the Bloomfield, N.M. area.  The facility, to be constructed turnkey by United Technologies, would have a nominal rating of 70 MW, resulting in a gas burn of about 15 MMcf/d.  The plant would require gas deliveries at approx. 500 psig.  The outtake power would be sold both locally and on the grid using a TriStates 69kv transmission line that is proximate to the site.  Given the "politically correct" nature of these facilities, the City of Farmington has agreed to fund construction with a $70MM bond.

As you can see, we're in the very earliest stages of conversation.  We'll keep the group posted on progress.

Rick,
It was really great visiting with you the other day.  It never ceases to amaze me how small a world this is.  I hope this project moves forward and we get the opportunity to work together again.

Attached for your use is the schematic you spoke with Ron Matthews about.  It's not too terribly detailed, so I don't know if it will be useful or not.  We have much more detailed images of the Bloomfield area on our alignments, but without a legal description, we're a little blind.

I don't know if you've had a chance to get the legal description for the proposed plant site yet or not, but if you have it, would you forward that on to me?  We could then get started at not only putting together a rough cost estimate for the tap and meter, but we could begin looking for the best route for a lateral line between the facilities.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Alan,

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet with historical pressures at two points.  The column titled south of Kingman will be the closes point off TW's mainline to the Red Lake Storage facility.  You can see that the pressures are above 900 psig at least 90% of the time.  The pressures for Sept 10-14 are bad readings for Kingman which you can tell by looking at the CS1 discharge pressures.  Must have been a bad transmitter.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance on supplying data for you analysis.  If you need help in my absence, please contact Kevin Hyatt who is the Business Development.  Kevin's number is 713-853-5559.

Keith,
Ron's note pretty well summed it up.  Sorry my earlier correspondence didn't speak clearly enough to these issues.  This is a new electric generation plant.  It doesn't necessarily fall into any existing utility service area, as far as I know.  If anything, it might fall into the City of Famrmington's muni gas service.  However, if the City of Farmington is funding the plant (including  the cost of the interconnect) through muni bonds, it's doubtful they'll have any problem with the source of supply.

I'm interested in the theory that would necessitate our receiving prior permission to interconnect with a direct end-use customer in any area, uncontested or otherwise.  They'll be building the lateral line (or we'll build it, but they own it).  All we're really doing here is the delivery point.  I understood this situation fits within the FERC's new guidelines for construction of such facilities, and would not require a prior notice filing.

Let me know what additional information you might need.

Ameramex Energy Farm Project will be a new facility with no current supplier.  The location is approximately 0.75 miles southeast of the Bloomfield station.  The load would be served form the San Juan Hub and would not effect firm capacity through Bloomfield.  If you need any details from a Marketing perspective, please call Jeff Fawcett.

Ron, is this a new plant?  Or is it existing?  If it is an existing plant, is it being served presently?  If it is receiving service, by who?  If this is a by-pass, we will need to file a Prior Notice or obtain a signature from the group serving the load agreeing to the by-pass.

Please let Bret know what the situation is.

Keith

Subject:	Ameramex Project- Bloomfield

Rick Moore with Ameramex called and said their project is moving forward- on a fairly expedited basis.  They've recently obtained a City of Farmington pledge of public funds (a precursor to a formal bond issue) to underpin the financing. 

To refresh your memory, this project is another "trigeneration" project.  Ameramex will use the waste steam from the electric generation turbines to heat a hydroponic lettuce farm, as well as use the combustion carbon dioxide.  We've previously provided a route map and estimate (0.75 mi. of 4" pipe, $486K direct/indirect cost) to Ameramex.

Ameramex's financing deal is now dependent upon completion of the interconnect and commencement of service in approx. 7 months.  To this end, Ameramax has requested a walk through of the potential route and a revised (if necessary) estimate of the cost to interconnect.  There are several other issues to be dealt with here, including what is the final deal structure; including whether TW may possibly providing interim financing until the issuance of the muni bonds.

Rick Moore would like to get together with myself and representatives of operations and/or engineering to survey the route and decide on the ultimate design/configuration of facilities.  Depending on the outcome of the survey, he'd like a formal proposal for TW for financing the construction of the lateral and interconnect facilities.

Ron, since you provided all the prior facility planning support, I'd like for you to continue providing the liason support to TW Commercial on this project.  I'll also be calling on the San Juan Team to work with you and engineering to optimize the design/routing of this interconnect/lateral pipeline.  I'll work with the customer to set-up a site meeting when you return to work after 2/5/01.

To bring you and others up to speed, I've included a couple of the original email(s) giving a little more detail on the estimate and a map of the route:

Subject:	Amerimex Energy Farms Project

Jeff,

I talked with the San Juan team and came up with a pipeline route to the proposed Energy Farms site located in S1/2  SE1/4  Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, and the NE1/2  NE1/4 Sec. 24, T29N, R11W all in San Juan County, NM.  Per the correspondence, Energy Farms is looking at a delivery around 15 MMcf/d.  The best approach to serving this load would be to take gas from the suction side of Bloomfield CS.  The 4" pipeline would start there a travel about 0.75 miles to the northwest section of the proposed site (see attached map).  A metering facility would be located at the beginning of the pipeline still inside of TW's property along with the other meter facilities.  Below is a breakdown of the facility cost.  Estimated costs are + 30% and would have to be refined.  

0.75 miles of 4" pipeline & side valve		$286,500

4" orifice meter run w/ gallagher flow 		$199,900
conditioner, & flow control

						$486,400


There is a possibility that the meter facility costs could be lower by using an existing metering header system but a more detailed review would be required.  Please feel free to call if you have any questions.  I will send you a copy of the estimated costs for both the pipeline and measurement since they can't be attached.

Subject:	Amerimex Bloomfield Project

Attached see a note I sent to Rick Moore.  Rick works for a company called Amerimex.  Rick and I worked together in gas supply at EPNG ("the early years").  Amerimex is a developer of "trigeneration" projects.  In addition to the subject project for Bloomfield, another one is being considered for Santa Theresa, N.M.  If you recall, we were introduced to trigeneration when we were discussing an electric generation plant on the site of a hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup.

Trigeneration is an environmentally friendly technology that utilizes the "byproducts" of electric generation.  "Cogeneration" refers to the process where waste heat/steam generated during the combustion of gas turbines is sold commercially (usually to manufacturing facilities) for plant purposes.  "Trigeneration," on the other hand, refers the process where not only is the waste heat/steam utilized, but also the carbon dioxide.  Therefore, trigeneration is a perfect fit for a greenhouse that requires both heat and carbon dioxide for the plants.

Amerimex has proposed a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse in the Bloomfield, N.M. area.  The facility, to be constructed turnkey by United Technologies, would have a nominal rating of 70 MW, resulting in a gas burn of about 15 MMcf/d.  The plant would require gas deliveries at approx. 500 psig.  The outtake power would be sold both locally and on the grid using a TriStates 69kv transmission line that is proximate to the site.  Given the "politically correct" nature of these facilities, the City of Farmington has agreed to fund construction with a $70MM bond.

As you can see, we're in the very earliest stages of conversation.  We'll keep the group posted on progress.

Rick,
It was really great visiting with you the other day.  It never ceases to amaze me how small a world this is.  I hope this project moves forward and we get the opportunity to work together again.

Attached for your use is the schematic you spoke with Ron Matthews about.  It's not too terribly detailed, so I don't know if it will be useful or not.  We have much more detailed images of the Bloomfield area on our alignments, but without a legal description, we're a little blind.

I don't know if you've had a chance to get the legal description for the proposed plant site yet or not, but if you have it, would you forward that on to me?  We could then get started at not only putting together a rough cost estimate for the tap and meter, but we could begin looking for the best route for a lateral line between the facilities.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.
