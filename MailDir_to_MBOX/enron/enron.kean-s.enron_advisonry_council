Steve,

Thought you would be interested in learning that the HBS event in Madrid which Pankaj Ghemawat was organising has now been postponed.  John Thompson had planned to participate from Enron and I believe will likely do so once we have a new date from Pankaj.

Thanks,
Fiona

Dear Barbara,

Thanks very much for trying multiple methods to reach me.  As it so 
happens, given the economic slowdown, people?s reluctance to travel et 
cetera, the decision was taken this morning to postpone the Harvard-IESE 
program.  So while we remain very interested in having Mr. Thompson or some 
other senior manager from Enron comment on the discussion of the Enron case 
(which I wrote), the session is in the process of getting 
rescheduled.  I?ll get back in touch as soon as we have a new date.

Thanks again.

Pankaj

Steve,

Attached is a rough draft proposed by Irwin Stelzer  for the Advisory Council 
meeting on April 10-11.  You will note that Gavyn is  on the agenda from 3:15 
- 4:00 p.m.   I spoke with his assistant regarding the possibility of Gavyn 
departing on April 12 and was told that he has another commitment and will 
need to depart the Enron Building by 2:30 p.m. on April 11. 

Also, can you tell me if Prof. Joe Grundfest and Lawrence Kudlow are new 
members of the Advisory Council?  I would like to update our contact list.

Comments, please.

Vanessa

Washington would be fine .... there's always plenty to do there.  I got a 
note from Ken asking that you and I have the first meeting and come back to 
him withrecommendations.  I agree with the agenda you have set out.  
It may also be worth discussing how we can use the individual  members of 
this group outside of the meetings with the  Enron Exec Committee: there may 
be efforts elsewhere in the company which would benefit from the advice and 
input of members of the group.

		 Subject: Advisory group

I believe that you agreed at our last meeting that it might be well for you 
and me -- and Ken if available -- to discuss plans for this group in 2001. My 
feeling is that we should review its composition after the election -- we may 
lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look 
at who is contributing and who isn't etc.
My agenda would be:
1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two 
purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important 
fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it 
is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).
2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss 
in 2001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time? 
3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001, given 
whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.
4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting 
outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we 
like to attract?
I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you 
thinking.
Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn 
Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more convenient.

Let me review where we stand for the April 10-11 meeting.
1.  I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review
comments on the significance of recent developments for Enron.
2.  I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.
3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review "the lay of the land" in the
environmental policy area.
4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron,
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the "monopoly-too-big-and-powerful" question,
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply
picture. Have we heard from the author of "When Genius Fails"?

Possible letter to Paul Joskow from Ken Lay
Dear Paul:
As you may have heard, Enron has an advisory committee consisting of
leaders in the academic and business communities (list attached). This
committee meets twice each year, along with invited speakers on subjects of
interest to Enron. Top executives of our company do their best to attend.
Starting on the afternoon of October 30, and concluding late in the day
on October 31, we will be meeting in London. I was most impressed with your
presentation at the Aspen Institute energy forum, and am hoping that you
might consider joining our meeting to discuss "Where do we go from here: how
to preserve the momentum of deregulation after California."
We would be delighted to cover business class travel costs and all other
expenses incident to your trip to London, including hotel costs should you
choose to extend your stay for several days. In addition, there would be an
honorarium of $XXXXXX.
Do try to join us: you will find the other speakers interesting, and
London a delightful place in which to spend a bit of time. And we would
benefit enormously from your participation.
Sincerely,

Thanks, Dr. Stelzer -  I'll pass on to Ken.  Also, he agrees with you
and Steve to not ask any others, specifically Dick Schmalensee, since
Joskow did accept.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

HEREWITH A LETTER THAT KEN MIGHT WANT TO SEND TO CALLUM MCCARTHY
Dear Callum,
    I much enjoyed chatting with you in Aspen: it is always a relief to meet
a regulator who tries to get the process right, and then lets the chips fall
where they may.
    In its efforts to remain open to new ideas, Enron has established an
advisory council consisting of academics, business people, political gurus
and the like (Irwin Stelzer is a member). This council meets twice a year
with Enron executives. Our next meeting is scheduled for October 31 at our
London headquarters ( we have a dinner the previous evening, at which we
review the state of political play around the world; you might find it
interesting).
    One of the suggestions at the Aspen meeting was that traditional
regulation of energy markets might usefully give way to, or at least learn
some lessons from, financial regulation. Since you are one of the few
regulators who has had experience both in financial markets and in utility
regulation, we are hoping that you might be willing to share some ideas with
us on this subject. A 30-minute talk followed by what I promise will be a
very lively discussion would be perfect from our point of view.
    We know how pressed you are for time, but are hoping you will favor us
with your thoughts on this interesting and difficult subject.
    KEN: I don't think you can offer him a fee.

Steve,

Good talking to you again today.  Here are the slides based on my 
(mis?)interpretation of Teresa Amabile's work that I presented in April.  I 
think it would be great to get her to speak at your management conference.

Best,

Pankaj

POSSIBLE DRAFT LETTER TO ROD EDDINGTON at BA FROM KEN LAY
Dear Rod:
Irwin Stelzer says that he has mentioned to you that the next meeting of
Enron's advisory council is scheduled for London on October 30 and 31. The
council includes several prominent permanent members drawn from the  business
and academic communities, to which we add distinguished guests with expertise
in areas of interest to us on an ad hoc basis. Several of our top executives
attend these meetings.
I am hoping that you might help us in two ways. Irwin tells me that your
headquarters building is innovative and has many features that it would be
well worth our while to know about and to study. Would it be possible for you
to arrange a tour for a few of our executives, both from the US and the UK,
say on the morning of October 30?
Second, we understand from Irwin and from the press that you have done
wonders in reinvigorating and revitalizing the BA staff. I am hoping that you
might be willing to share some of the secrets of your success with us,
perhaps at an informal buffet lunch at our new London headquarters on October
31, or at some other time on that day that might be more convenient for you.
Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on what you have
achieved at BA, in a short time and in a tough market.
Sincerely,

From MAILER-DAEMON Mon Apr 18 14:25:25 2022

I know you guys have a few other things on your mind these days, but......
With Rod Eddington unavailable, might we not best fill that slot by inviting 
Brian Wilson. He is an energy minister, charged by Blair with chairing a 
review by the Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit of energy 
policy to meet "the challenge of global warming while ensuring secure, 
diverse and reliable energy supplies at a competitive price." My 
understanding is that Britain is worried about excessive reliance on gas from 
foreign sources, scared to death by the experience in California, and looking 
for some way to revive the nuclear option.
    If you think Wilson worth having, I will draft an invitation letter for 
Ken's consideration.
    Steve: Are you going to take Eddington up on his invitation to visit?

As you know, Ken has talked to Larry Summers about serving on Enron's Board 
of Directors.  Larry told Ken that in light of his selection to head Harvard, 
he wants to hold off going on any corporate boards for now.  My understanding 
is that Larry will most likely accept Ken's offer at the end of the year.   

In the meantime, let me suggest a candidate for Enron's Advisory Committee.  
Lee Sachs was Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets under Bob 
Rubin and Larry.  Lee coordinated the energy negotiations for Larry at the 
end of the Clinton Administration.  You probably met Lee at those meetings.  
Lee is brilliant.  He was a Managing Director at Bear Sterns before joining 
the Treasury team.  He is a huge fan of Enron and is constantly telling me 
how extremely well positioned Enron is for the future.  He has done 
considerable research on our business model and is constantly talking to his 
buddies on Wall Street about us.  Lee will undoubtedly be a significant 
player in any future Democratic Administration.  I know he would be an 
invaluable addition to this Committee.  He has not decided what he is going 
to do next, but has several extremely good offers on the table from large 
investment firms and hedge funds. None of these would conflict with this type 
of activity.   I thought I would plant this suggestion with you not knowing 
exactly how these things are done.

At John Sherriff's suggestion we have scratched Russia from the "area of 
opportunity" list and substituted Spain. After talking to Gavyn, he and I 
agreed that Oscar Fanjul, formerly of Repsol and now with Goldman and others, 
knows more about this subject than anyone, so he will cover Spain and Tim 
Plaut will do Germany (resumes will be faxed to Rosalee as soon as I have 
them. Because of Oscar's schedule (must leave by 10:30 AM) we should put this 
item first on the agenda.

    Let me review where we stand for the April 10-11 meeting.
1.  I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review 
comments on the significance of recent developments for Enron.
2.  I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.
3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review "the lay of the land" in the 
environmental policy area.
4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, 
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the 
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief 
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on 
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the "monopoly-too-big-and-powerful" question, 
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply 
picture. Have we heard from the author of "When Genius Fails"?

Judging from the latest agenda, we seem to have had a communications
mix-up: Grundfest can't come, etc. So let me set out my understanding of the
agenda as it now exists. We should keep this flexible as I have taken the
liberty of inviting Karl Shapiro, from Berkeley, to join us and make a
presentation based on his experience in the Intel, Microsoft and related
cases, and in the FTC action against BP's entry into trading. Karl has
written the best book on the subject of network monopolies, copies of which I
will circulate if he says "yes", which I will know by Tuesday mid-day. The
point of his presentation would be to consider whether Enron's "dominance" of
some of the markets in which it operates and which it makes contains the
seeds of future problems. If we land Shapiro, we can move Kristol back to the
dinner slot, or fold the California session into the dinner report by Enron
executives.
I would suggest that we advise those who received the agenda that it is
being substantially revised, lest those that I have told to prepare talks
think they are off the hook, and Davies gets upset about the schedule. We can
then send out a final agenda later this week.
I have briefed Kristol, Portney, Davies and Ghemawat to try to make their
presentations a bit more Enron-specific than in the past.
Dinner
Usual review by Enron executives of latest developments.
Wednesday
Because my understanding is that Gavyn Davies has to leave early, we
should schedule the economic review by him and by Larry Kudlow as the first
presentation.
8:00-8:45 Gavyn Davies: Developments in the world     economy, with special
emphasis on those that might affect Enron.
8:45-9:30 Larry Kudlow: Developments in the US economy; likely policy
reactions.
9:30-10:30 Discussion, perhaps with Jeff leading off with "what worries us
most".
10:30-11:00 Coffee break and continued discussion.
11:00-12:00 The California situation: Report by Enron and discussion of the
implications of the California situation for future policy and Enron
prospects.
12:00-12:30 The political situation: Bill Kristol.
12:30-1:30 Lunch and discussion of Kristol report, with Ken Lay adding his
information and appraisal.
1:30-2:00 Environmental policy: with emphasis on whether recent changes are
likely to affect Enron. Paul Portney.
2:00-2:30 Discussion of Portney presentation.
2:30-3:00 The availability to Enron of human capital. Pankaj Ghemawat will
review what he and his Harvard colleagues, as well as other experts, are
saying about the ability of companies such as Enron, no longer small, to
continue to attract the best and the brightest.
3:00-3:45: Discussion of Pankaj's presentation, perhaps led by Steve Kean.
