	Ladies and Gentlemen:

	Yesterday,  Ted Rosen (a partner with Wortham's, our broker on the insurance policy on all three of these claims) and I spoke with Sharron West, the contract adjuster for Underwriters, about the status of a response to our request for extensions of time in all these cases, which she received by fax last Friday.

	West advised that she had transmitted this request to Underwriters with her recommendation that it be granted.  West anticipates an answer by this Friday.  West will be largely out of town on vacation between Christmas and the New Year, and volunteered that she did not want to be bothered with responding to lawsuits during the few days she would be in the office.

	As I told Ron, I have a high degree of confidence that our request will be granted.

	I will report further tomorrow.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

Please see the information below received from the broker.  As I indicated 
from the very beginning, this possibility has always existed.  When received, 
I will distribute a copy of the surveyor's report to whomever needs a copy.  
Please advise if you need a copy.

Jim:

I spoke to Sharron West this afternoon and she had just gotten in a 
preliminary report from the surveyor.  Sharron is going to send us an 
official fax/letter in the next few days.  In the meantime, from my 
discussion with Sharron, I understand that the surveyor is of the opinion 
that the generator is not a total loss and is repairable.  He also believes 
that the initial damage to the generator has been aggravated by the delay in 
repairing the generator.

Jim, as you well know, an insured under any ocean cargo policy is required to 
act as a prudent uninsured would act.  With this concept in mind, and with 
the surveyor believing that the generator is repairable, Sharron has 
suggested that Enron should obtain a written estimate for repairs as soon as 
possible.

Again, we should have something from the adjuster in writing within the next 
few days.  In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ted Rosen

Thanks for the update, Fred. The idea of the meeting is great, and any 
further views of the matter should be either expressed in that meeting or by 
phone, and not in e-mail to the greatest extent possible.  I think Kay would 
agree on the need to discuss this and not write anymore.

To be clear, Fred is  not saying below that that the "eye-rolling" expresses 
his or EECC's view of the claim, but he is in fact expressing support for 
Kay's view of the claim. Fred is simply saying we should have a team meeting 
to get everyone involved on the same page so they understand the matter 
properly and don't send mixed signal.

Ben - although my role is changing inside Enron, you know I will always help 
you as requested/required.  I am discussing this particular situation with 
Keith Dodson inside the newly formed EEAS  - we will call you to discuss.  

Things I think/recommend should happen regardless:

1)  Your idea of a coordination meeting is good.  The combined efforts of our 
teams....., taking 7 months to get the generator uncrated and inspected..., 
is not spectacular.  

2)  I think that ........, in the right way........, we need to insure that 
if anyone asks Janet Dietrich or Delainey whether we were impeded on the 
Electrocities project, and......, whether we would really be willing to 
litigate a claim based on that..... I want to make sure our answer doesn't 
change.  Don't take that the wrong way, but......, I believe there are people 
inside ENA and the old EECC that have rolled their eyes in front of 
Westinghouse regarding our claim for LD's.  I don't think we have 
Westinghouse believing we were impeded (because the Enron team isn't 
convinced).  Westinghouse's cooperation might be different if they sincerely 
believed that Enron was "impeded".  Kay Mann's input that Enron was really 
impeded weighs strong on my mind (I put a lot of weight in Kay's opinions).  
If you could get that clarified/reinforced/defined at that level......, we 
can insure we are on solid ground in talking w/ Westinghouse.  Kay makes a 
good point that it doesn't matter what "...the team believes....".  I 
politely disagree and feel that if we convinced ourselves......., 
Westinghouse's cooperation might change.  

3)  I think that Kay (and John Schwartzenburg's team if Kay desires) should 
advise if any official notifications should be made to Westinghouse (e.g., we 
haven't really ever formally "rejected" delivery.... maybe we want to rely on 
the correspondance that has evolved, and...... a new letter now would weaken 
our case..... but....., I believe you would want Kay (and maybe John if Kay 
desires) to advise if any such notification could strengthen our position.  )

Keith and I will call.

The person to contact, I believe, is Michael Hinds.  His number is 55869.  
However, Ace Roman, who sits on our floor and is a manager with the group, 
should help you coordinate, particularly with the LJM lawyers.  His number is 
39587.  Kirkland and Ellis out of DC does their legal work.  Amy Harvey, who 
I believe is an associate there, worked with us on the "E-Next Generation" 
deal.  Her number is 202-879-5053.

Jim:

Thanks for the reply. Sharron has focused on the comment that the unit has 
not actually been "delivered" to  Enron and that title, ownership, and 
custody are still with SWPC.   She is therefore questioning Enron's insurable 
interest.

I have commented to her that Enron can insure goods titled to another party 
as long as Enron has instructions to insure the goods.  Sharron does not 
dispute this, but has asked if there is any documentary evidence that would 
show that Enron had instructions to insure this cargo. I think we can 
interpret "instructions" liberally.  If there is a purchase order or similar 
agreement that states that Enron is to insure the turbine, that should be 
sufficient.  Would you please ask for this?

Thanks and regards,





Ted Rosen

Gentlemen, if I've left out who this should be directed to, please forward
to whomever can provide the answers.

Is Enron Equipment Procurement Co. still pursuing a claim against Enron
cargo insurers?
comment - we probably need to discuss this with ena's ben jacoby so that
you can receive specific guidance.  as i understand it, since enron's
insurance (e.g., marine cargo) is primary, enron will pursue a claim
against the enron cargo insurer.
further comment - the answer remains "yes."  again, must discuss with ena's
ben jacoby because of his commercial involvement/expectations.

If so, I must provide proof of ownership of the damaged generator (other
than an e-mail message).  Please provide ASAP.
comment - what do you need?  while enron has made approx. 95% of the
payments for the gas turbine generator unit, it is likely that ownership
still resides with westinghouse - i.e., it was never delivered per the
equipment purchase contract with enron.  again, what type of documentation
do you need?  does it matter if westinghouse is still in the loop?
further comment - at this time, title, ownership, care, custody and control
remain with westinghouse.  further, westinghouse must continue to be in the
loop because the monies for the damaged might ultimately be paid to them -
i.e., westinghouse provides enron with a new replacement generator; then,
westinghouse receives the insurance money to cover their loss/damaged
generator.

Is the generator to be repaired?
comment - no, the generator is not to be repaired.  instead, a replacement
generator is being manufactured in austria for westinghouse and is to be
delivered to the port of houston in the mid-april01 timeframe.

If so, when and where.
comment - n/a.

Underwriters surveyor needs to examine it when it is taken apart.
comment - n/a.

The surveyor was told when he made an inspection at the Port that a
detailed repair estimate would be provided to him on the other unit that
was damaged, and this would provide a guide as to the type of damage on our
unit.
comment - only the generator was damaged.  the gas turbine is complete and
resides in houston.  i do not understand your comment about damage to
another unit
further comment - the "other unit" does not belong to enron - i.e., it
belongs to another westinghouse client.  plz understand that the "other
unit" was immersed deeper in salt water than our unit.  as a result, its
damage was greater.  in that we are getting a replacement generator, we
have to assume that the "other unit" that was also damaged is also being
replaced.  therefore, it can be inferred that the damage estimate for both
generators are approximately the same.

To date, nothing has been sent to our surveyor.
comment - none.
further comment - we are not sure about your statement.  our understanding
is that you previously both communicated with and sent the accident survey
of westinghouse's underwriter to our surveyor.

As it has been over three months since the unit arrived in Houston in its
damaged condition, if Enron expects to collect from Enron cargo insurers,
we must move forward in providing the information previously requested, or
prejudice Enron's claim to recovery due to lack of cooperation with the
adjuster/surveyor.
comment - noted.

Jim,

Sharron seems content with what you have provided regarding Enron's 
responsibility to insure, etc.   Thank you.  She is now asking the following:

1.  What is Enron claiming for?
response - siemens westinghouse is/will be claiming for full and total loss 
of the generator.  a replacement generator is currently being manufactured in 
austria and will arrive in port of houston, tx in the mid april 01 
timeframe.  we have a meeting sched with them next week.  we'll attempt to 
determine what the "value" of just the generator is from siemens-westinghouse 
(i.e., we have a price for the gas turbine generator unit, but not separate 
prices for just the gas turbine and the generator).

2.  What is the financial extent of Enron's claim?
response - plz refer to above comment.

It seems to me that the short answers to these questions would be:

1. The cost to repair the generator that Enron was supposed to receive from 
SWPC.
response - again, we are talking about a total loss and not just a repair.  
plz see above.

2.  Unknown until SWPC actually tears down the generator and determines the 
extent of damage and the cost to repair.
response - again, the generator will not be repaired.  therefore, this 
question is n/a.

Those answers, however, will certainly provoke further questions such as:

1)  When and where is SWPC going to tear down the unit,  inspect it, and 
determine the repair costs?
response - plz see prior email.  also, the generator will not be repaired.  
therefore, this question is n/a.

2)  Isn't the water damage just getting worse as the generator just sits 
there unopened, with no measures taken to prevent further deterioration?
response - plz understand that siemens westinghouse still has care, custody 
and control of the damaged generator.  at this time, siemens westinghouse 
considers the generator a total loss.  normally, this would have been a great 
question.  however, given the circumstances, this question is n/a.


Jim, if anyone can provide a response to Sharron's questions, please let me 
know what you find out.

Thanks,




Thanks,

Ted Rosen

Jim:

Thanks for the reply. Sharron has focused on the comment that the unit has
not actually been "delivered" to  Enron and that title, ownership, and
custody are still with SWPC.   She is therefore questioning Enron's
insurable interest.

I have commented to her that Enron can insure goods titled to another party
as long as Enron has instructions to insure the goods.  Sharron does not
dispute this, but has asked if there is any documentary evidence that would
show that Enron had instructions to insure this cargo. I think we can
interpret "instructions" liberally.  If there is a purchase order or
similar agreement that states that Enron is to insure the turbine, that
should be sufficient.  Would you please ask for this?

Thanks and regards,





Ted Rosen

Gentlemen, if I've left out who this should be directed to, please forward
to whomever can provide the answers.

Is Enron Equipment Procurement Co. still pursuing a claim against Enron
cargo insurers?
comment - we probably need to discuss this with ena's ben jacoby so that
you can receive specific guidance.  as i understand it, since enron's
insurance (e.g., marine cargo) is primary, enron will pursue a claim
against the enron cargo insurer.
further comment - the answer remains "yes."  again, must discuss with ena's
ben jacoby because of his commercial involvement/expectations.

If so, I must provide proof of ownership of the damaged generator (other
than an e-mail message).  Please provide ASAP.
comment - what do you need?  while enron has made approx. 95% of the
payments for the gas turbine generator unit, it is likely that ownership
still resides with westinghouse - i.e., it was never delivered per the
equipment purchase contract with enron.  again, what type of documentation
do you need?  does it matter if westinghouse is still in the loop?
further comment - at this time, title, ownership, care, custody and control
remain with westinghouse.  further, westinghouse must continue to be in the
loop because the monies for the damaged might ultimately be paid to them -
i.e., westinghouse provides enron with a new replacement generator; then,
westinghouse receives the insurance money to cover their loss/damaged
generator.

Is the generator to be repaired?
comment - no, the generator is not to be repaired.  instead, a replacement
generator is being manufactured in austria for westinghouse and is to be
delivered to the port of houston in the mid-april01 timeframe.

If so, when and where.
comment - n/a.

Underwriters surveyor needs to examine it when it is taken apart.
comment - n/a.

The surveyor was told when he made an inspection at the Port that a
detailed repair estimate would be provided to him on the other unit that
was damaged, and this would provide a guide as to the type of damage on our
unit.
comment - only the generator was damaged.  the gas turbine is complete and
resides in houston.  i do not understand your comment about damage to
another unit
further comment - the "other unit" does not belong to enron - i.e., it
belongs to another westinghouse client.  plz understand that the "other
unit" was immersed deeper in salt water than our unit.  as a result, its
damage was greater.  in that we are getting a replacement generator, we
have to assume that the "other unit" that was also damaged is also being
replaced.  therefore, it can be inferred that the damage estimate for both
generators are approximately the same.

To date, nothing has been sent to our surveyor.
comment - none.
further comment - we are not sure about your statement.  our understanding
is that you previously both communicated with and sent the accident survey
of westinghouse's underwriter to our surveyor.

As it has been over three months since the unit arrived in Houston in its
damaged condition, if Enron expects to collect from Enron cargo insurers,
we must move forward in providing the information previously requested, or
prejudice Enron's claim to recovery due to lack of cooperation with the
adjuster/surveyor.
comment - noted.

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

1.   Met with Ron Tapscott, Jim Studdert and Scott Laidlaw, primary subject 
insurance claim status.  Scott Laidlaw gave Jim a letter from Siemens in 
which Siemens says the generator is a total loss (or cost to repair is 
greater than a new one).   Jim will use this to give to the adjustor to get 
the survey and adjusting process going again.   Jim needs a point of contact 
at Westinghouse to get access to the generator and get it unboxed for the 
adjustor to look at.   The generator that is shown in the report is the 2nd 
generator in the hold and is not ours.  Apparently our generator has not been 
unboxed and thus not directly observed.   Rumor has it that the water line is 
not as high on the Enron box as it was on the box of the generator that is 
not Enron's.

In my conversation with Mark T this morning I asked him for the name and 
telephone number of the Westinghouse point of contact for the adjustor so 
that the adjustor can arrange to see the generator.   He stated he would have 
SW PM provide us that point of contact.   I will sent Mark an Email reminding 
him of such.

At the risk of making anyone or everyone nervous- but I think it is important 
for everyone to understand, I believe getting the pay-out value from the 
insurance adjustor is a vital element of the Calpine- SW deal.   If the 
adjustor comes back with something less than the replacement value (other 
than the deductible) because he asserts that the generator was not (as a 
result of the water- but is now because it sat in a box unattended) a total 
loss, or presently is not  viewed as a total loss then SW will go to full 
battle stations asserting the loss occurred when Enron had risk of loss and 
damage.

2. Mark T and I talked status.    Mark T asked if we thought that Calpine 
would buy the Unit.   Mark T indicated that he spoke with Mike Costa and per 
Mike C SW is one to two days away from reaching a deal with Calpine on the 
Nov Unit.   I queried Mark on whether SW has other customers for the Nov 
Unit.   He was properly evasive, indicated that SW did not, but said 
opportunities always come along.  Mark T indicated he questioned whether the 
April delivery would work for Calpine- he agreed that an April delivery of 
the generator would get them on line in time, but as he saw it he wondered if 
Calpine had an engineer in line to build the plant.   In the midst of the 
conversation he wondered whether NEPCO would even have the capacity to get it 
on line given other work.   I  am not sure whether that was a deliberate 
query to see if we were interested in having NEPCO build the plant.

Ben  Summary of conversation-  if we Enron as sure we have a sale with 
Calpine, then I think Mark was saying we can do the deal.   I think the ball 
is our court to flush out Calpine  (am I spelling it correctly?)- within the 
next 24 to 48 hours.

3.  Update on expedited shipment by air.   Cost would be in the order of 
magniture of $275,000  +/-  (versus $30- $50K by vessel) , problem- latest 
information is that as configured it will not fit on an airplane.  We had 
people looking to see if anything can be taken off the generator to get it on 
the airplane.   I mentioned this to Mark T, he questioned airplane transport 
in that he felt SW transportation people would have already suggested it.

4.  Ron and James.   I queried Mark T to determine whether  SW had gone after 
the shipper.  I put it in the context that we did not want to inadvertently 
upset what SW might be doing with the shipper.  He did not know.  I doubt we 
will get any information on that front.

Ben - although my role is changing inside Enron, you know I will always help 
you as requested/required.  I am discussing this particular situation with 
Keith Dodson inside the newly formed EEAS  - we will call you to discuss.  

Things I think/recommend should happen regardless:

1)  Your idea of a coordination meeting is good.  The combined efforts of our 
teams....., taking 7 months to get the generator uncrated and inspected..., 
is not spectacular.  

2)  I think that ........, in the right way........, we need to insure that 
if anyone asks Janet Dietrich or Delainey whether we were impeded on the 
Electrocities project, and......, whether we would really be willing to 
litigate a claim based on that..... I want to make sure our answer doesn't 
change.  Don't take that the wrong way, but......, I believe there are people 
inside ENA and the old EECC that have rolled their eyes in front of 
Westinghouse regarding our claim for LD's.  I don't think we have 
Westinghouse believing we were impeded (because the Enron team isn't 
convinced).  Westinghouse's cooperation might be different if they sincerely 
believed that Enron was "impeded".  Kay Mann's input that Enron was really 
impeded weighs strong on my mind (I put a lot of weight in Kay's opinions).  
If you could get that clarified/reinforced/defined at that level......, we 
can insure we are on solid ground in talking w/ Westinghouse.  Kay makes a 
good point that it doesn't matter what "...the team believes....".  I 
politely disagree and feel that if we convinced ourselves......., 
Westinghouse's cooperation might change.  

3)  I think that Kay (and John Schwartzenburg's team if Kay desires) should 
advise if any official notifications should be made to Westinghouse (e.g., we 
haven't really ever formally "rejected" delivery.... maybe we want to rely on 
the correspondance that has evolved, and...... a new letter now would weaken 
our case..... but....., I believe you would want Kay (and maybe John if Kay 
desires) to advise if any such notification could strengthen our position.  )

Keith and I will call.

Mitch,

The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during 
the conference call.  They requested something along the lines of what is in 
the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language:

SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to 
maintain an equity position in either of these companies.  SWPC further 
acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity 
will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.


How does this sound?

No way.  My reading of the contract indicates that they can't withhold 
approval anyway.  Did they bring this up in Friday's conference call?

john - thanx for your time on phone this afternoon.

a) just received cc of letter from westinghouse.  in it, they assert that:

"title to the existing generator passed to enron upon delivery into the 
united states.  delivery occurred at houston on or about 23jul00.  as 
required by the contract and incoterms 1990, risk of loss to the generator 
passed to enron when the generator arrived (ddp) at houston while the 
generator remained on board the common carrier.  the generator was delivered 
in an undamaged condition.  title and risk of loss passed to enron before the 
water damage to the generator occurred."

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

b) per the contract between enron and westinghouse:

section 15.1.2 title to Equipment - Title to the Equipment will pass to 
Purchaser immediately upon entry into the united states.
section 15.2 risk of loss - Seller shall bear the risk of loss and damage 
with respect to the Equipment until delivery of the Equipment to the Delivery 
Point in accordance with Section 3.2.1.  Seller shall be required to inspect 
the Equipment for damage at the Delivery Point.
section 3.2.1 - Seller shall cause the Equipment to be delivered to the 
Delivery Point on a DDP basis in accordance with Sections 10.2.1 by the date 
set forth therein.
section 3.2.2 - Seller shall be responsible for delivering the CT-Unit DDP to 
the: (iii) u.s. port of export by any means of transport.
section 3.2.3 - Seller shall perform customs clearance for the Equipment 
through u.s. customs and pay any import duties.
section 10.2.1 Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date - Seller will cause the CT-Unit 
(author's note - includes the generator) to be delivered in an undamaged 
condition in accordance with the Specification-CT to the Delivery Point (DDP) 
in accordance with Schedule I below (the Guaranteed Unit Delivery Date).  
(author's note - the date specified in the contract was later slipped per 
agreement with enron).
section 10.2.3 Completion of Delivery - delivery of the CT-Unit to the 
Delivery Point shall be considered complete for the purposes of Delivery 
Liquidated Damages as it pertains to the delivery of Major Components 
(author's note - includes the GT and generator) when the last Major Component 
of such CT-Unit is delivered DDP to the Delivery Point in complete and 
undamaged condition.  ...  Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the 
Equipment for condition of the Equipment upon actual delivery.  Purchaser 
reserves the right to reject damaged Equipment at any location; however, in 
the event a portion of the Equipment is damaged or defective upon delivery to 
the Delivery Point, Purchaser after making an initial assessment of the 
damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect 
the installation , operation, performance, reliability, efficiency, and 
warranty of the damaged Equipment may either:
(i) reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the 
preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept 
delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred, 
or
(ii) after taking into account such criteria and Seller's proposed plan for 
correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section 9.5, declare that 
delivery has occurred: in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or 
defect, it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical.

c) facts of the case, as we know them:

common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of 
houston approx. 14jul00.  i.e., that was the ship's estimated time of arrival 
(eta).
westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about 23jul00.
enron representative (frank cervenka) went to CTSS (i.e., the westinghouse 
facility here in houston) on friday, 21jul00 to inspect the combustion 
turbine.  during that inspection, westinghouse employees informed him that 
the generator had salt water damage at the port.  as a result, the following 
monday, 24jul00, he visited the port of houston with the siemens-westinghouse 
insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator.  note - this was just a 
cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged.  the full 
extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time - 
e.g., repair or replace were still viable options.
enron received formal notification (faxed letter) of the damaged generator on 
approx. 18aug00.
enron has already made progress payments to siemens-westinghouse in the 
amount of 95% of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator.
DDP, per incoterms 1990, means delivered duty paid.
Westinghouse, despite 2 prior requests from enron, has not provided copies of 
the customs clearance documentation.  i.e., we don't know the exact date that 
the generator cleared customs, or if it cleared customs.
title means ownership, but does not imply either risk of loss or care, 
custody, and control.  with title comes both ownership and the responsibility 
for payment of taxes.

d) info not known by enron:

when did ship come into port?
when did damage to generator occur?
when, or if, u.s. customs duties were paid?

f) info known by enron:

generator is a total loss, as determined by westinghouse.
per section 10.2.3 of contract, enron was not given the formal opportunity to 
inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port.  as 
recalled by matt tezyk, westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing 
that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred.  
(author's note - matt to find cc of that letter).

g) enron's assertions are that:

DDP was not satisfied.  i.e., delivery of the generator did not occur in 
accordance with the terms of the contract.
title (i.e., ownership) remains with siemens-westinghouse.
risk of loss remains with siemens-westinghouse.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

john - plz assess the copy of the contract provided to you this afternoon 
under separate cover.  we request a legal opinion as to whether delivery, in 
accordance with the contract, of the CT-Unit occurred or not.  plz call with 
any questions.  regards.  scott.

Yes, this is issue is still around.

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Ann,

Thank you for your response. I wanted to propose some different language for your consideration:

WHEREAS, the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage because (i) of its failure to, among other things, provide drawings with adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and (ii) excessive vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such damage.  As a result, Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to Siemens Westinghouse, in May of 2001, under the Contract in the amount of Four Hundred Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars ($409,666.00) for repair work performed on two of the stacks ("Warranty Issue").

I hope this gets us there.  

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: RE: Settlement agreement



Kay:

We are in receipt of Enron's proposed changes to the Settlement Agreement
and Release on the Gleason Project.  Unfortunately, it appears that the
intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial discussions
between our respective business representatives.   In past discussions with
Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of the
Gleason CT exhaust stacks, Enron tied its local low frequency noise concerns
to the stack reconstruction issue.  Although the causes for reconstruction
of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities, SWPC agreed that in the
interest of continued customer relations, we would be willing to make a
business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in exchange
for indemnification on future stack and noise issues. 

The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references to
the noise issues in the warranty definition, thereby eliminating any
coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that issue
from the Settlement Agreement.  This elimination substantially erodes the
value of Enron's indemnification, and the settlement overall.  As modified,
the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC, and it is in our best interest not
to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron.  Should Enron be willing
to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph, SWPC
would be willing to sign on to the deal.

Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.  SWPC would
like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron, but we will not make
payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no responsibility
unless such payment is part of a more global settlement.

notably, a reference to a request from Scott Laidlaw (dated January 12, 2001) 
noted in Lynn DeKrey's letter on January 18, 2001.

Absence of this correspondence jeapordizes our claim!  We need to close the 
loop on this information so we know our response is appropriate.  


Kay -- the attached letter is a newer version from the one you received 
yesterday.  I would appreciate any input you may have.


Thanks, Ron.

Thanks for sending me the 2000 Incoterms.  Our library was finally able to 
locate our copy of the 1990 Incoterms and I have reviewed them.

To answer your question, I don't think the Incoterms will have much of an 
effect on our analysis except with respect to the definition of DDP (delivery 
duty paid).  Section 1.14 of the Contract states that DDP shall have the 
meaning as defined in Incoterms 1990 (except as the parties otherwise 
specifically provide herein).  As best I can tell, Section 1.14 is the only 
provision of the Contract that mentions the Incoterms.

The introduction of the Incoterms (paragraph 22) states that "merchants 
wishing to use these rules should now specify that their contracts will be 
governed by Incoterms 1990"   At a minimum, this suggests that the Incoterms 
are not automatically incorporated into a given contract.  Rather, the 
parties should specify in their contracts whether the Incoterms will apply.  
In this case, the only reference I can find to Incoterms in the Contract 
(unless I am missing something) is Section 1.14 which simply incorporates the 
definition of DDP.

Additionally, I believe that the Incoterms DDP provision is good for Enron.  
Under the 1990 Incoterms, DDP "means that the seller fulfills his obligation 
to deliver when the goods have been made available at the named place in the 
country of importation.  The seller has to bear the risks and costs, 
including duties, taxes and other charges of delivering the goods thereto, 
cleared for importation.  While the EXW term represents the minimum 
obligation for the seller, DDP represents the maximum obligation.  The 
Incoterms go on to say that the seller has to place the goods at the disposal 
of the buyer at the agreed point at the named pace of destination.  The 
seller must bear all risks of loss of or damage to goods until such time as 
they have been delivered (i.e., the goods have been placed at the disposal of 
buyer).

Westinghouse will have to argue that the CT-Unit was placed at the disposal 
of Enron.  This will be difficult since they informed us of the damage before 
we ever looked at the CT-Unit.  Further, Westinghouse's argument sounds more 
like they rely on Incoterm DES rather then DDP.  Incoterm DES (Delivered Ex 
Ship) means that the seller fulfills his obligation to deliver when the goods 
have been made available to the buyer on board the ship uncleared for import 
at the named port of destination.  I have not seen any reference in the 
contract to Incoterm DES yet that is what it sounds like Westinghouse is 
arguing.

In short, I think our contract argument as reflected in the memo provides a 
sound basis for our contentions and the Incoterms should not be factored in 
other than as referenced in the contract itself.

If you would like a more detailed analysis of this issue in memo form please 
let me know.

Notes from subject mtg.  Steve Stein - please schedule something where we can 
get together and I can hand this off to you.  Need your involvement.  

0)  Prior to the meeting - I had called Ben to let him know of my 
transitioning to EES and that I wouldn't be there - he requested that I 
come.  Keith Dodson reviewed and requested that I attend and xtion w/ Steve 
Stein.  Steve Stein was to come to meeting, but didn't show.  Steve has been 
requested to take charge by Keith Dodson.  
1) Kay Mann, Ben Jacoby, Chris Booth, Ron Tapscott, and myself were present 
at the subject meeting.  
2)  Noone from EAS came except for me.  I called and Rigby came late.  
3)  Discussed situation - Calpine evidently bought the Nov01 Westinghouse 
Machine from Westinghouse, ending Calpine's interest in our "wet" 501D5A.  
4)  Everyone agreed that Westinghouse wasn't "focussed" on resolving this.  
Kay reminded the group that prior to litigating the contract called for a 
"high level Mgmt meeting".  Everyone seemed to agree that it was time to call 
such a meeting.  
5)  Rigby to draft a rebutal letter to the 15 Feb Westinghouse letter (where 
they again inferred that they had delivered the Generator, and if we wanted 
the new one....., we needed to provide a purchase order).  In that letter, 
Rigby will confirm that a)  we don't believe the machine was ever delivered, 
b)  we have been delayed/impeded, and c)  LD's to the tune of approx $4MM are 
due, and c)  we request the "high level mgmt meeting" prior to initiating 
litigation.
6)  Letter will go out with Dan Shultz's signature - need highest level just 
below Keith Dodson.  Since Dan had been involved...., the team chose him.  We 
might consider putting the letter out under Steve Stein's name.  The letter 
will also request that all future correspondance be addressed to John Rigby 
(this was Ben Jacoby's request).  
7)  Ben requested that if Dan Shultz gets any documents or calls......, that 
he refer them to John Rigby.
8)  Kay to edit letter and get out the door Fri 23 Feb.
9)  Rigby working w/ Jim Boullion to expedite insurance 
inspection/verification of coverage.  Bouillion will keep Rigby appraised.  
Inspection needed ASAP to confirm Generator is "totalled".  Evidently, the 
crate has now been opened, but....., our insurance inspector hasn't come 
yet.  
10)  Rigby to send email to Ben Jacoby's team every two days, detailing 
progress/req'ed action.  The entire team is disappointed in the combined lack 
of effectiviness of the "team" in getting this issue handled/resolved.  
11)  Ben requested that EAS have their best resouce available to inspect the 
generator with the insurance inspector - the team believes this should be Jim 
Sutherland or his designee/equivalent.  Chris Booth to acompany also.  
12)  Kay Mann confirmed that she had discussed the situation with the ENA 
origination team that was "... on the ground..." at VEPCO...., and they 
thought it was funny that anyone would think that the slipped Generator 
delivery date didn't "delay or impede" our efforts to close that deal.  Also, 
Kay reminded us that there was no tie between a specific project, and the 
"delay/impede".  
13)  At the high level Westinghouse meeting - who will be the senior Enron 
rep?  Kevin Presto was discussed by Kay/Ben.  I discussed Steve Stein.  To be 
discussed further.  At that high level meeting....., we need to insure that 
Westinghouse sees that Enron really was "delayed/impeded" .  Until they 
believe our claim for LD's has merit - they probably won't attempt to 
compromise on a settlement.  Westinghouse has offered to give us our money 
back (not confirmed, but Mark has offered to run that up the flagpole).  Ben 
has requested approx $4MM more to cover IDC.  Westinghouse has said.... "no 
way".  So...., we have approx a $4MM dispute.  Westinghouse doesn't believe 
we have been delayed or impeded - they are not aware that we were in fact 
impeded on Electrocities, nor are they aware of the broad interpretation of 
delay/impede that would require them to pay LD's.  The team believes 
Westinghouse is acting like they "delivered" the generator (in June 00), so 
they can "act" like there should be even another reason that they don't owe 
LD's.  The team believes that Siemen's position on "delivery" will change 
once they debate that with a Rigby, Schwartzenburg, or a Kay Mann

Ben
I understand from Bill Monahan that you wanted to see confidentiality
agreements currently outstanding from insurance company.

We submitted agreements to Chuck Newell and Sharon West.  Chuck's executed
agreement has been received but we are still waiting for Sharon.  We had
emailed Chris Booth to request status however we now understand he is out on
vacation this week

Attached is a copy of agreement documentation (4 pages) sent to Sharon West
and currently outstanding.

With high hopes that this is the FINAL final version, I'm attaching what I 
believe to be the execution copy.  Some things have been cleaned up, and 
Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.  I'm going to start collecting 
signatures.

1.0  ALL-   The attached DRAFT letter is confidential and to remain with 
addresses only, except as Kay Mann deems necessary to share for coordination 
purposes.

2.0  ALL-  I have had a couple calls with Jim Bouillion.  He is personally 
involved in facilitating the insurance inspector visit.

3.0  Per the results of the Wednesday Ben Jacoby meeting, as requested by Kay 
and Ben I have prepared a first draft of a letter to SW responding to the 15 
Feb SW letter.   

4.0  Kay-

a.   Per the meeting discussion I have put my name as the recipient of SW on 
future correspondence on this matter.   John S may discuss this with you, we 
may want to change this now or at a later time. 

b.   I based the delivery LD on the max amount SW is liable to pay, 20% of 
the PA.    If they deliver by end April the total amount would be around $7.5 
MM, but given the cap, they top out at $4.9 MM.   You may want to examine the 
demanded amount in light of when you were impeded.

c.   I may want to change the letter signature  name to Steve Stein in that 
Keith Dodson has tasked him to be the execution lead responsible from an EPCC 
perspective; mindful that EA has the lead as to where we go on this.

d.  I look forward to your comments, fixes and direction.

Regards 


John

Westinghouse Insurance Issues=09


I have reviewed the insurance policy and selected correspondence relating t=
o the "wet turbine" issue with Westinghouse.  Westinghouse has provided est=
imates to repair the wet turbine for approximately 5.9 million and to repla=
ce it for approximately 3.4 million.  The adjusters for the insurance compa=
ny have advised in correspondence dated April 25, 2001 that their investiga=
tion is ongoing and that Enron should conduct itself as a "prudent uninsure=
d" pending a complete investigation of the claim.  The adjusters have also =
stated that Underwriter's liability will be limited to the reasonable costs=
 of repairs directly caused by the contact of the turbine unit with sea wat=
er.  The adjusters have indicated that additional damage, such as rusting, =
resulted from a failure to protect the turbine unit following the initial d=
amage caused by the sea water.

Enron is concerned that the replacement cost of the "wet turbine" (approxim=
ately 3.4 million) will increase if Enron chooses to delay replacing the un=
it until the insurance company completes its investigation.  Enron has also=
 asked whether the adjuster's statement that Enron should act as a "prudent=
 uninsured" requires Enron to replace the unit now at the lower cost.  It i=
s my understanding that Enron does not currently have a project in which it=
 could place the turbine.  It is also my understanding the Enron does not k=
now whether the repair or replacement cost is likely to increase should Enr=
on delay repairing or replacing the turbine unit until after the insurance =
company has completed its investigation.

Section 19.2.1 of the Purchase Contract between Enron and Westinghouse requ=
ires Enron to maintain cargo insurance to insure "Equipment against loss or=
 damage arising from customary 'all-risk' marine perils . . ."  Section 19.=
2.1 also states that the cargo policy must specify Westinghouse as an addit=
ional insured.  Although the policy I have reviewed does not specifically n=
ame Westinghouse as an additional insured, I am told by Enron representativ=
es that Westinghouse was in fact properly named as an additional insured on=
 the policy.

The policy itself contains several clauses that are important to this analy=
sis.  The Duty of Assured Clause states:

It is the duty of the Insured and their Agents, in all cases, to take such =
measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimizing a l=
oss and to ensure that all rights against carriers, bailees or third partie=
s are properly preserved and exercised.

The policy also contains a Time for Suit Clause which provides in part:

No suit or action on this Policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be s=
ustainable in any Court of Law or Equity unless the Insured shall have full=
y complied with all the terms and conditions of this Policy, nor unless com=
menced within twelve months next after the happening of the loss . . . .

damage.  In that case, the coverage could be less than the full replacement=

Finally, it does not appear at this time that Enron is required to purchase=
 the replacement unit now under the "prudent uninsured" standard.  First, E=
nron has a good faith position that Westinghouse is obligated to replace th=
e unit because risk of loss had not passed to Enron at the time the unit wa=
s damaged.  Second, it is our understanding from discussions with Enron rep=
resentatives that Enron has no reason to believe that the replacement cost =
will in fact go up over time.  Thus, Enron has no reason to believe that pu=
rchasing the replacement unit now will minimize the loss as required by the=
 Duty of Assured Clause.  Third, Enron does not currently have a project in=
 which it can place the unit.  When and if Enron did have a project for the=
 unit, it would seem prudent to go ahead and purchase the replacement at th=
at time.

Based on the above analysis, Enron can make a compelling argument that it h=

I spoke with Kay and she agreed that her interpretation of the settlement 
letter was the same as mine (i.e. no waiver of warranty claims or claims of 
faulty construction/design).  Subject to Mitch's agreement (because he had 
the primary role in the negotiation of that settlement with Westinghouse), we 
would suggest writing a letter alerting Westinghouse of our claim and of our 
desire to meet quickly to discuss this matter.  The letter might also suggest 
that if we are not able to resolve this matter quickly we expect to draw down 
on the letter of credit.  This latter threat might gain the level of 
attention that we desire.  Of course, I would be careful about how it is 
phrased (it might be worthwhile to run it by Andy Edison, the litigator).

Don -

Please forward on to Allegheny.

In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the 
turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation 
capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens 
Westinghouse Power Corp ("SWPC") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland 
facilities in the following way.

1.  Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines 
from 182mw to 185mw.  Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units 
to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the 
control curves accordingly.  SWPC further will agree that operation of the 
Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating 
parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate 
the warranty.  SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we 
give them authorization.

2.  SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments 
will not be unreasonably withheld.  SWPC will honor warranty claims currently 
outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such 
assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and 
Wheatland contracts.

3.  SWPC agrees to assist Enron in providing technical information, including 
redacted copies of the purchase contracts, applicable technical bulletins, 
etc. to Allegheny.  This information will be limited to information which is 
currently available to Enron and of a technical nature only.

I believe all of these features are significantly beneficial to Allegheny.  
Please ask Allegheny for feedback, as we will be entering into the agreement 
by the end of the week.

Regards,

Mitch Robinson

Matt,

I have attached a letter we plan to send today (or, tomorrow at the latest) 
and require copies of letter's from SW that Dan Schultz references in his 
Nov. 10th letter.  In addition, there is another matter regarding other 
correspondence we need to have in hand that other letters reference.  Most 
notably, a reference to a request from Scott Laidlaw (dated January 12, 2001) 
noted in Lynn DeKrey's letter on January 18, 2001.

Absence of this correspondence jeapordizes our claim!  We need to close the 
loop on this information so we know our response is appropriate.  


Kay -- the attached letter is a newer version from the one you received 
yesterday.  I would appreciate any input you may have.


Thanks, Ron.

		 Subject: Westinghouse Insurance Issues

I have reviewed the insurance policy and selected correspondence relating to 
the "wet turbine" issue with Westinghouse.  Westinghouse has provided 
estimates to repair the wet turbine for approximately 5.9 million and to 
replace it for approximately 3.4 million.  The adjusters for the insurance 
company have advised in correspondence dated April 25, 2001 that their 
investigation is ongoing and that Enron should conduct itself as a "prudent 
uninsured" pending a complete investigation of the claim.  The adjusters have 
also stated that Underwriter's liability will be limited to the reasonable 
costs of repairs directly caused by the contact of the turbine unit with sea 
water.  The adjusters have indicated that additional damage, such as rusting, 
resulted from a failure to protect the turbine unit following the initial 
damage caused by the sea water.

Enron is concerned that the replacement cost of the "wet turbine" 
(approximately 3.4 million) will increase if Enron chooses to delay replacing 
the unit until the insurance company completes its investigation.  Enron has 
also asked whether the adjuster's statement that Enron should act as a 
"prudent uninsured" requires Enron to replace the unit now at the lower 
cost.  It is my understanding that Enron does not currently have a project in 
which it could place the turbine.  It is also my understanding the Enron does 
not know whether the repair or replacement cost is likely to increase should 
Enron delay repairing or replacing the turbine unit until after the insurance 
company has completed its investigation.

Section 19.2.1 of the Purchase Contract between Enron and Westinghouse 
requires Enron to maintain cargo insurance to insure "Equipment against loss 
or damage arising from customary 'all-risk' marine perils . . ."  Section 
19.2.1 also states that the cargo policy must specify Westinghouse as an 
additional insured.  Although the policy I have reviewed does not 
specifically name Westinghouse as an additional insured, I am told by Enron 
representatives that Westinghouse was in fact properly named as an additional 
insured on the policy.

The policy itself contains several clauses that are important to this 
analysis.  The Duty of Assured Clause states:

It is the duty of the Insured and their Agents, in all cases, to take such 
measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimizing a 
loss and to ensure that all rights against carriers, bailees or third parties 
are properly preserved and exercised.

The policy also contains a Time for Suit Clause which provides in part:

No suit or action on this Policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be 
sustainable in any Court of Law or Equity unless the Insured shall have fully 
complied with all the terms and conditions of this Policy, nor unless 
commenced within twelve months next after the happening of the loss . . . .

The policy is silent on the specific issue of what happens in the event that 
repair or replacement costs increase over time.  The policy also does not 
specifically define a "prudent uninsured."  Under New York law, however, the 
measure of the duty that is placed on an uninsured owner in this context is 
that action which a prudent uninsured owner would take under similar 
circumstances.  See Intermondale Trading Co. v. North River Ins. Co. of New 
York, 100 F. Supp. 128, 132 (S.D.N.Y. 1951).  Additionally, the Duty of 
Assured Clause set forth above sets forth a similar "reasonableness" standard 
for the conduct of the named Insureds under the policy.  Thus, the "prudent 
uninsured" advisory given by the adjuster is a real standard which Enron must 
consider in making its determination of whether to replace the "wet 
turbine."  Furthermore, the insurance company's ongoing investigation will 
not operate permit an inference of waiver of a contractual limitations period 
when the insurer advises the insured to act as a prudent uninsured.  See Issa 
v. Reliance Ins. Co. of New York, 683 F. Supp. 82, 83 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  Thus, 
Enron should pay careful attention to the Time for Suit Clause which requires 
that a suit be brought against the Insurer within one year from the date of 
loss, in this case sometime in July of 2001.

In light of the policy provisions and the "prudent uninsured" standard, the 
question becomes whether it is "prudent" for Enron to replace the turbine 
unit now for 3.4 million or wait until such time as Enron has a use for the 
unit or until the Insurer agrees to provide full coverage.  It is possible 
that the adjuster will agree with Westinghouse that the unit was a total loss 
on the date the initial damage occurred.  However, in view of the adjuster's 
April correspondence, it is a possibility that the Insurer will maintain that 
subsequent damage, such as rusting, occurred as a result of Enron and 
Westinghouse's failure to protect the unit after the initial sea water

Enron's decision to pay for a replacement unit now also requires 
consideration of the disputes between Enron and Westinghouse regarding 
delivery and risk of loss.  Based on our previous analysis of the delivery 
issues, Enron has a plausible legal position that Westinghouse should bear 
the cost to replace or repair the damaged unit.  As an additional insured 
under the policy and in light of its own legal position, Westinghouse must 
also conduct itself in a reasonable manner.  Why is it any more prudent for 
Enron to pay to replace the unit now and fight with the insurance company for 
full coverage then it is for Westinghouse to do the same thing?  If either 
party absorbed the cost of the replacement unit now, that party would look 
first to the Insurer for full coverage and failing that would seek to recover 
the uninsured portion of the replacement from the other party.  This will not 
change whether the cost to replace the unit goes up or down.  Further, 
Westinghouse has control of whether the repair and replacement costs go up or 
down.  If Enron chooses not to pay to replace the unit now and the cost goes 
up, Westinghouse would be opening itself up to a larger claim in the event 
that the Insurer did not cover the full replacement cost.

Finally, it does not appear at this time that Enron is required to purchase 
the replacement unit now under the "prudent uninsured" standard.  First,

Based on the above analysis, Enron can make a compelling argument that it has

Enron should note, however, that the "prudent uninsured" standard will 
ultimately be determined by the trier of fact.  Thus, it is ultimately a 
business decision for Enron whether to go ahead and replace the unit now.  
Additionally, Enron may wish to consider filing a declaratory judgment action 
or other claim against Westinghouse, the Insurer or both to determine who 
will bear the ultimate responsibility with respect to repair and replacement 
of the damaged unit.

confirming today's calls, westinghouse is asking enron whether we'd consider 
the following settlement of the "north america peaker/panama/electrocities" 
gtg issue, particularly as it relates to the damaged generator (again, plz 
understand that this is not a formal offer at this time; will come within 
days depending on our response.  westinghouse does not want to go to their 
senior management with a "settlement" offer without knowing that enron will 
respond favorably when formally presented; i.e., just a waste of time for all 
concerned):

westinghouse will re-imburse enron asap with money's paid to date by enron to 
westinghouse.  note - westinghouse is willing to consider taking back the gtg 
for what enron paid westinghouse, BUT NO addl monies will be offerred or 
considered.  this is a "ceiling."
money to be wired within days of settlement agreement.
westinghouse takes back the unit "as-is."
no further claims/rights of action between the parties on this gtg/contract.
this potential of an offer from westinghouse has a life span of just a few 
days (i.e., this week).  westinghouse is "long" on D5A machines and for them 
to take this one back into the fold will present them with marketing 
challenges in 2001.

pros
brings cash back to enron on the balance sheet before end of year.
we don't currently have a use for this gtg in an enron project.  (i.e., 
unless an idc treatment can be agreed, project's now can't typically afford 
this unit).
we don't currently have an anticipated use for this gtg in the next 6 to 9 
months in an enron project.
we don't have to pay for storage; i.e., such costs are already accruing.
dispute resolution (per contract) consists of senior management meeting 
seeking to settle; if unable, the remedy is the n.y. courts.  therefore, we 
can avoid lawsuit.  therefore, we'll save on outside legal costs.
as part of settlement, we can possibly secure an option forward or first 
right of refussal on a "f" or "g" machine for projects in 2002.
by settling now, this avoids further month by month increases in idc.

cons
idc costs to be written off by ena (or elsewhere?).

for ben - plz advise.  dan shultz, kay mann (hopefully) and scott laidlaw are 
available to meet today on this issue.  regards.  scott.

Subject: Westinghouse - State Group Claims

I spoke with Kay and she agreed that her interpretation of the settlement 
letter was the same as mine (i.e. no waiver of warranty claims or claims of 
faulty construction/design).  Subject to Mitch's agreement (because he had 
the primary role in the negotiation of that settlement with Westinghouse), we 
would suggest writing a letter alerting Westinghouse of our claim and of our 
desire to meet quickly to discuss this matter.  The letter might also suggest 
that if we are not able to resolve this matter quickly we expect to draw down 
on the letter of credit.  This latter threat might gain the level of 
attention that we desire.  Of course, I would be careful about how it is 
phrased (it might be worthwhile to run it by Andy Edison, the litigator).

Kay:

We are in receipt of Enron's proposed changes to the Settlement Agreement
and Release on the Gleason Project.  Unfortunately, it appears that the
intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial discussions
between our respective business representatives.   In past discussions with
Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of the
Gleason CT exhaust stacks, Enron tied its local low frequency noise concerns
to the stack reconstruction issue.  Although the causes for reconstruction
of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities, SWPC agreed that in the
interest of continued customer relations, we would be willing to make a
business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in exchange
for indemnification on future stack and noise issues. 

The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references to
the noise issues in the warranty definition, thereby eliminating any
coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that issue
from the Settlement Agreement.  This elimination substantially erodes the
value of Enron's indemnification, and the settlement overall.  As modified,
the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC, and it is in our best interest not
to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron.  Should Enron be willing
to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph, SWPC
would be willing to sign on to the deal.

Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.  SWPC would
like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron, but we will not make
payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no responsibility
unless such payment is part of a more global settlement.

We are selling both the Wheatland and Gleason facilities, so along with the 
agreement below, I've attached a letter that we could show potential 
purchasers.  Thoughts?

Time is critical, since we are right now in negotiations with purchasers, so 
please let me know if I need to forward on to someone else.

summarizes my understanding of our verbal agreement.  Please review and let 
me know of any changes you recommend.  Since I will be in Orlando with 
limited e-mail capability, please follow up on any changes with a call to my 
mobile number (281-467-9599).  As a backup, you may leave a voice mail at my 
office number (713-853-3957).  If you're satisfied with the letter, please 
e-mail it back to me.  I'll have it printed on Enron letterhead and signed.  
Please also copy my assistant, Felicia.

I've copied Mike Miller on this e-mail.  Please copy him on any e-mail 
response, in case I can't access my e-mail from Orlando.

The second document (SWPC Letter) is a suggested draft of a letter intended 
to be sent by someone at SWPC to me.  The intent of this letter is to provide 
a document that we can provide to third parties without providing all the 
pricing details of our verbal agreement.

Again, please call me with any questions.

when you have Mac or Max on the phone, make sure that we are receiving a response to the DDP and Export House questions.  Or a date when this will be produced.  Isn't there an obligation on there part to have a response within a certain number of days once they have the question(s) in hand?  Secondly, I would not think he could keep us from the customs broker since the activity performed serves as proof that the DDP requirements were met (which is a contractual obligation).

Thanks, Ron.

Subject:	RE: EEPC v. SWPC/In re Industrial Bridge

     I just got off the phone with Mac Miller, SWPC's attorney.  I told him that the January 8 extension was a surprise to my business client, who was not inclined to agree to it.  However, my client wanted the following information ASAP:

     1.  An estimated cost of producing and shipping the discovery requested from SWPC.

     2.  The earliest possible time frame on getting the documents and interrogatory answers from SWPC.

Miller, not surprisingly, said that this was a surprise to him, but I made clear that my instructions from my client were very firm, and he understood that.  Miller did say that this put him in a bit of a bad position, as SWPC had apparently initially not wanted to agree to any extension, and play "hard ball", and he convinced them otherwise.

Miller was in the middle of about three urgent projects, but we agreed we would speak tomorrow morning when he was less rushed and he could give me a realistic time frame for production.

Miller said he thought what he had from SWPC did include a document that showed when the DDP was paid.  Miller first said that we wouldn't like the answer, because it was before the damage, then said he really couldn't say that, because he didn't know.   Otherwise, he has not requested the customs brokers' file yet, which is in Houston, and will not give me authority to speak with the customs broker about this (nor would I have expected him to).  I got the impression that SWPC itself may not yet have sent Miller all the documents responsive to the DDP/Export House discovery requests.

In the morning, I will have our copy service come over and review the documents we will need to produce (since I have not had a chance to review the file for responsiveness, we may not have to produce everything, and may spend less money than the estimate reflects) to SWPC.   Also, I am not familiar with the discovery requested by SWPC that may be due; for instance, whether it includes interrogatories for which we need to draft answers and have someone available who can sign.   I will get my arms around this in the morning and then call you.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Britt

I think first we need to know what the cost would be.  secondly, will we have a net billing since we will have a cost to produce our documents.  example

our cost to produce documents for them       $400
SW cost to produce documents for us          $500

we owe them                                              $100

is this how that will work?????????

     Just so I'm clear:

     Does this mean I am supposed to tell Max Miller, SWPC's attorney, that we do not wish to wait until January 8, and want to exchange documents ASAP?

     If so, I need to call him immediately, and see what his reaction is.  I also need to make arrangements to review and produce the documents that we need to send to him.

     Let me know.

Stuart -

Attached are the chain of e-mails on the agreement.  I recommend a direct 
red-line between the two agreements (what I sent them, and what they sent 
back) before we mark up their letter.

They understand what we are doing with the plants, and I don't think will 
have a problem with the changes we discussed.  I don't yet know what their 
response to Brownsville will be however.

After you review the attached give me a call to discuss.

Mitch

Hi there,

In resolving some issues with Westinghouse there was an agreement reached 
concerning the disposition of the Blue Girl turbines, as well as certain 
issues relating to the Gleason and Wheatland facilities.  In connection with 
this agreement I am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning 
resolution of these matters.  As you can see, Westinghouse has requested that 
NEPCO, EEPC and LJM2-Turbine, LLC sign the agreement.

Your comments would be appreciated.

Attached are SWPC revisions to your proposed letter. Our contracts group
advised to add signatures for all affected parties to the agreement, in
addition to know parties for contracts on Gleason and Wheatland sites, we
have added parties identified in draft Blue Girl contract, Enron input as to
appropriate Enron signatures for the Blue Girl would be appreciated.  Please
call with any concerns.

I talked with Westinghouse this morning.  They have some minor changes to the 
agreement.  They'll have the changes back this afternoon.  If the changes 
reflect what they described on the phone, then we'll be ready to sign 
tomorrow morning.

Mike, are you in tomorrow to sign?

Thanks Mike.  SWPC said they want to add the words "or any subsidiary of 
Enron" to the part that says we won't bill them anymore invoices.  Their 
concern is that there are current invoices out there, but they are from 
NEPCO, not from me.

I'm comfortable with this, but at some point, EE&CC/NEPCO/EES will likely 
want us to pay for these then.  The amount is approximately the same as the 
amount we (EE&CC and ENA) owe SWPC for out-of-scope charges.

I'll just get Kevin to sign the letter.


Thanks,

Mitch

Dave and Chris:

I want to make you guys aware of the latest on the 501D5A. First, discussions 
with Montana Power are starting to progress quickly. They have proposed we 
sign a two week exclusivity agreement with them on the turbine, and have 
agreed to pay us $200k. Unlike the exclusive with NorthWestern, this 
agreement will not be binding as to ultimate purchase terms. It will simply 
provide that we don't talk to anybody else during the exclusivity period. The 
target price for a deal with Montana, which they have indicated is 
acceptable, is $29 million, less the continuing payment obligations to 
Westinghouse. If this deal is consummated at $29 million, the gross margin to 
Enron Corp should be approximately $1 million.

With this in mind, we have approached Westinghouse about resolving the 
dispute on the damaged generator. Because a replacement generator is on 
order, essentially the issue is who (as between Enron and Westinghouse) bears 
collection risk on the insurance claim associated with the generator. We have 
proposed that we split the risk, and specifically that Enron pay $1.5 million 
for the replacement generator, with insurance proceeds split 50-50 with 
Westinghouse up to the point of recovery of our $1.5 million. We would also 
waive our LD claim as part of this deal. In order to do the Montana Power 
deal, we need to resolve this generator claim.

Chris, Kay and I support this approach for a few reasons. First, it generates 
income for the company. Second, let's just say the handling of the claim by 
the former EECC was not stellar, and the contract provided for us to manage 
the insurance on the unit.  Third, while we may have a good claim for LDs 
under the turbine contract, we may have to move into litigation mode to 
collect them.

We of course want to solicit input from both of you before we proceed too far 
with either Montana or Westinghouse. Because of this, we have written the 
exclusivity agreement with Montana to provide that if we cannot deliver the 
generator, we will return the exclusivity payment. 

The last complication (as if we didn't have enough), is that the transfer 
price deal with CALME is not finalized. Louise has taken this on, and is 
talking to them to get the deal that Janet and I proposed earlier done (which 
essentially provides that CALME eat $2 million of carrying costs associated 
with the period during which they had responsibility for the turbine). Please 
see the e-mails from Louise below.

Please let us know if you are on board with our approach as regards Montana 
and Westinghouse, and I will then follow up with Louise on her discussions 
with CALME.

Thanks and regards,

Ben

Louise:

My responses:

1. The carrying costs have been capitalized, and under the accounting rules 
will continue to be capitalized through the last payment date under the 
turbine contract.

2. At this time, the turbine value is undetermined. While we have identified 
one potential counterparty (Montana Power), we do not have a signed deal. In 
addition, we are in the middle of a contract dispute with Westinghouse 
regarding the damaged generator. While we hope to resolve this dispute in the 
context of our exiting the turbine position, there exists the potential of 
this going into litigation.

3. Janet and I proposed the deal I discussed with you to CALME in December, 
but never got a formal response. I have put in several calls to Elio 
Tortolero at CALME, but have not heard from him for about a month. He advised 
me at that time that he would get me a counter proposal. My group has had de 
facto management responsibility for the unit since December.

4. This unit was initially an ENA unit, but was taken by CALME (David Haug) I 
believe in December '99 for projects they were considering. I am not aware of 
the terms of that transfer. 

FYI, I have attached a payment schedule for the turbine.

Please let me know if you have any other questions. Also, I have attached an 
updated site bank map which includes our Texas site which was inadvertently 
left off the previous e-mail.

Regards,

Ben

Louise:

I need to know two things: (1) Have the carrying costs been expensed through 
Jan. 1 and (2) Is there commercial value to the turbine?  If there is value 
to the turbine, then I really don't understand allocating costs to a business 
unit that doesn't own the turbine in order to create the illusion of a 
profitable transaction.  I also need to know on what basis and against what 
agreement CALME agreed to bear the carrying costs.  The project it supposedly 
related to has been dead for several years.

Jim
