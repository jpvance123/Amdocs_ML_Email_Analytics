You have been selected to serve on the 2001 VP Performance Review committee.  This selection is based on your performance and recognizing that you possess the behaviors we are trying to underline, encourage and reward through our PRC process.

In serving on the committee we'd like to underscore the important role you will play not only  with respect to the VP PRC, but also in setting the standards and guidance for PRC's across Enron.

The PRC is the foundation on which our talent is managed and rewarded.  Therefore, it is critical that you give it your full attention, prepare appropriately, and serve as champions for the process from an overall Enron perspective.

A meeting of the PRC Committee is scheduled for  April 3, 2001, in the Enron Building 50th Floor Boardroom to discuss mid-year 2001 PRC.  Tele-conference/Video conference will be provided where appropriate.

Dear Greg,

I just spoke with Liz regarding my request for a brief meeting with you this week.  In light of Enron's overall thrust to focus on merchant oriented activities and to diminish exposure on assets in emerging market, my boss, Chris Hunt, suggested that I meet with you, among other individuals, to seek advice on alternative career options at Enron.  Although I am open to areas in which I would be most useful to the company, I do have a particular interest in getting involved in wholesale electricity markets.

I hope you will have the time to meet briefly.  For your convenience, attached below is my resume.

Best regards,
Manuel

9-10am is great for Richard.  Does John have his own office?  If not, would you book them a room for an hour or so.

Richard didn't mentioned a topic for the meeting, I think it's just a general catch-up.

Do let me know the room number, or the location of John's office.

Many thanks Kim,

Kim,

I would like to get on John's calendar tomorrow (the morning would be best if available) to discuss two points:

Vintage gas option
Potential 25 MW, 4 month power purchase from Alcoa

This could take up to an hour depending on the levels of John's questions.

Thanks,

	3:30
	4:00

Thanks so much, Kim!

Gentlemen,

On Thursday, June 21st, Steve Lowden, Sr. VP Bus Dev with Marathon Oil, will be in our offices to discuss opportunities between Enron and Marathon (MRO).  He and I have discussed three main areas of intial focus (i) joint venture of MRO's production with Enron's trading/risk management capabilities, (ii) LNG, and (iii) power generation opportunities around their refineries.  He will also have two other people with him whose names have not yet been provided.  The agenda is outlined below.  I have coordinated with your assistants and these appointments should be on your calendar.

	11:00	Greg Whalley - Macro Discussion
	11:30	John Lavorato - Marketing/Trading Discussion
	12:00	Tim Detmering - Business Development, Asset Divestitures
	1:00	Les Webber - LNG Discussion
	1:30	Trading Floor Tour
	2:00	Dave Duran - Power Generation Discussion

With the exception of the meetings with Greg and John, the meetings will be held in EB 3335.  Briefing materials on MRO are being prepared and should be delivered to each of you no later than Tuesday morning. I will be happy to meet with you to discuss the materials or pursue any questions that may arise.  I have heard MRO's President, Clarence Cazelot, publicly describe Enron as a company to emulate. MRO is in transition as it is moving out from under the US Steel (USX) umbrella.  Cazelot and Lowden have been  interested in meeting with Enron.  Maybe there is an opportunity to do something with them.  

Thanks,

Subject: Simulated Trading

The front end of the simulated trading in EOL is set up now. In order to get all the bridging done into the downstream systems (TAGG), it looks like Monday, July 30th is the latest that the deals will be able to bridge directly into the system (hopefully sooner). There are a few more details I need from you guys.
1. It appears that the desk heads are also going to have a simulated book. Will these books be used to trade other commodities, and do they need to be calced by other commodity groups risk groups?
2. Is there anyone besides the desk heads and trading track people that we will need to set up books for beyond the ones that we have already talked about? 
Thanks

Mr. Lavorato:
 
I was given your name by Brian Edgeworth as a  possible contact for employment opportunities with Enron.  I was part of  Goldman Sachs C$ fixed income effort for four (4) years.  Goldman recently  decided to exit this business entirely.  I was involved in a  trading/capital markets role in both C$ corporate bonds and securitized  products.  I am interested in Enron because I believe it to be one of the  "smarter"  organizations out there.  I am flexible in terms of  location.  I have attached a copy of my resume for your  perusal.
 
I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.   I can be reached either via the phone number below or by replying to this  email.  I will attempt to contact you in the next couple  of days to confirm your receipt of this email.
 
Regards,
 
Robert Downer

Subject:	ANC-Rexam Legal Review and Restructure Strategy


Everyone -

I understand we are in front of a customer, ANC-Rexam, discussing potential contract renegotiation structures and language.  I would like to temporarily stop dicussions until we can review what our legal position is regarding our current contract with ANC-Rexam and the associated strategy we are following in our current contract renegotiation discussions.  EWS Risk should have the current positions and values ready on Monday afternoon so I suggest we meet then.  

I will have Kim Hillis coordinate a time and location for Monday.

Thanks,

Subject:	Modesto Maranzana Terminal Value

We are concluding the valuation and booking of the Modesto Maranzana transaction. The final point that needs to be agreed upon to properly book the transaction is the year 5 terminal value of the plant. 

The model currently represents a terminal value of $7.5 million based upon subjective rational. We have analysed the market and economic situation thoroughly and believe it is appropriate to accurately represent the terminal value as $12 million. The rational and economic analysis is covered in the below e mail. 

I would like to discuss this with you sometime today. I will call to see if we can set up a short discussion. Let me know if you would like Vlady to participate.

Based upon getting your concurence and the final review of the model with Joe we should be ready to book the transaction early next week.

Subject:	Modesto Maranzana Terminal Value

We need to review the terminal value issue in the 5 year model. As we have discussed and John, I believe, agreed we do not believe salvage value is relevant in this short term time frame. I would also argue an arbitrary number such as $7.5 million is also not reflective of the true value in year five.

We have already received a verbal indication from Duke that they would have an interest in the facility at $9 - $11 million. Based upon Duke's minimal due diligence this is relevant in reconfirming our initial valuation and reflecting that there is demand for power generation assets in Argentina. 

In addition we believe the most accurate reflection of terminal value in year 5 is closer to our initial purchase price of $12 million. The below valuations, local market grid assessment, and our forward power curve support this conclusion.

1) Market Multiple of EBITDA Valuation:

There are two "public" companies that are currently trading on the local stock exchange, the Merval. Central Puerto and Central Costanera. Both are thermal power units in Argentina.

On average the EBITDA multiple for these companies is equal to four (3.8 + 4.2))2 = 4

Modesto Maranzana assumes an EBITDA of approximately $3 million.   MMPP EBITDA $ 3 MM x 4 = $ 12 MM

This is again supportive of our valuation of $12 million


 

2) Most Recent Market Transaction Valuation:

On Average the last 3 power acquisition transactions in the market were above $230 kW and the current market average is $213 kW. Based upon MMPP's installed capacity of 70 Mw and using the market average of $213 kW the plant could be valued as high as $14.9 million. This is again supports a conservative valuation of $12 million or $171 per kW.

Molly,

Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for
a  trading position. Interviews with John Lavorato, Jeff Shankman,
Gary Hickerson, Stinson Gibner.

I talked to him in New York and he is considering
other opportunities, so we have to act fast.
I think John will like him more than Punit.



Thanks

Subject:	Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast and Solicitation


As we prepare for the kick-off of Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, Building Houston's Future, we are asking our top-level executives to set the standard of giving during the Leadership Giving Campaign that will run from July 23 through August 3.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.

Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way.  

You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans.

The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26.

Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com. 

At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are. 

Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st.

John,

We'd like to meet at 1:00 pm today to seek approval for our latest proposed investment.  We're looking to put up to $4.5 million (out of a $12 million total round) into Serveron, which designs and partially assembles both transformer monitoring equipment and battery monitoring equipment.  Their business model is twofold.  They both sell the equipment outright for those companies that want to perform the monitoring services themselves, and they offer a monthly 24-hour remote monitoring service for those companies that would rather outsource the activity.

Revenues for 2000 were about $750K, 2001 should be $2 million plus, 2002 around $8 million.  The monthly burn rate over the next twelve months will scale to about $800K after the hiring of all of the senior management team.  The company will have to raise an additional round of $10 million or so within 15 months.  That amount will then take them to a cash flow positive position in 2003.

Wayne Mays of ENA and Mike Boutcher of EES have both reviewed the technology and agree that Serveron has a reasonable advantage with their transformer monitoring equipment and a sizable advantage with their battery monitoring equipment.

Thanks,
Kevin x33995
