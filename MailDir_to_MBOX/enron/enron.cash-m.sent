Subject: Recent ASAP on AAP issues


I am sending you our most recent ASAP.  Our ASAP's are our summaries of
recent developments in employment matters.  This ASAP addresses the recent
changes in the regulations related to affirmative action plans.  Employers
which have contracts with the federal government, or contracts with federal
contractors, must prepare and maintain affirmative action plans (AAPs) as
long as they employ 50 or more employees, when the contracts are for $50,000
or more. The changes addressed in this ASAP are quite technical and require
careful consideration.

Please double click on the above link to access the ASAP.  Let me know if
you have trouble accessing this ASAP, and I can send you a hard copy.  You
also may visit our website (www.littler.com) to review this and other

addition, let me know if you do not want to receive these updates, and I
will delete you from my distribution list.

I am sending you links to our newest ASAP's on California wage and hour and
workers compensation issues.  Our ASAP's are our summary of important
developments in employment law.  If you do not have employees in California,
these ASAP's probably are not relevant to your company.

The first ASAP summarizes recent developments relating to whether or not
computer professionals and nurses must be paid overtime.  The link to this
ASAP follows:

http://128.241.163.162/nwsltr/asap_sb88.html

The second ASAP is a general overview of the current state of the workers'
compensation system in California.  This may even be of interest if you do
not have employees in California because the issues that arise in California
often occur in other parts of the country.  The link to this ASAP follows:

http://128.241.163.162/nwsltr/asap_insurance.html

Please notify me if you have problems opening this link.  I can send you a
hard copy of the ASAP if necessary. In addition, feel free to print or
forward this link to others in your or other companies, or use it in any
other manner that assists your organization. In addition, let me know if you

depend on whether the INS approves those applications."  Michelle

I have expanded on it a bit:

As part of the hiring process, the Company will sponsor the transfer of your 
H1-B visa. Please contact Margaret Daffin at 713/345-5083 as soon as possible 
to discuss the documentation necessary to initiate the transfer.  In 
addition, as part of the Performance Management Process at Enron, your job 
performance will be reviewed within the first 6 months of employment 
(year-end 2000).  If your job performance is within the top 33% of your peers 
(employees in the IT function at your level), we will sponsor you for an 
employment-based permanent residency application (green card).  The 
application process will begin shortly after the year-end review is 
finalized.

Subject: Green card Verbage





To get Andre, we have to have some language that provides him an assurance 
that we'll support him for a green card. I discussed this with Beth and she 
is ok with providing some language like this. 

I would propose that we say something to the effect of : "We will support the 
H1B transfer. You will be reviewed for job performance within the first 6 
months. If your job performance is within the top 33% of IT people at your 
level, we will support you for a green card process at the end of the 6 month 
review. 

Even with this language, I think it's iffy that  he'll accept. 


3) I think our critical path on recruiting is as follows : 
Recruiting: Technical team leads for Ken / Regan in the Unify Settlements and 
Accounting area
Recruiting: EDI team lead / developer
Hiring (some assumptions here): Matt Pena as gas operations manager, Paul 
O'Neal as Delphi developer for DCAF.


I really appreciate all the support that ya'll are providing. 

Thanks.

We found another change for the employment agreement language.  The reference 
to the full name of the Admin Committee should read "the Administrative

Effective May 8, the guidelines outlined in our April 14th training session 
will be officially implemented.  This means that employment agreements for 
VPs and above are not to be generated unless you have received a completed 
and approved request form.  Each business unit should call Mary McKendree 
(713-345-8085)  for the form and we will fax or hand deliver it to them.  The 
form must  be signed by the appropriate HR personnel for the business unit 
(names to be provided to Mary McKendree by each business unit) and then 
returned to Mary McKendree.  The form will be initialed by someone in 
Executive Compensation (Mary McKendree, Mary Joyce, or Pam Butler) and 
delivered to you for generating drafts.  Please do not distribute a draft to 
anyone without a signed and initialed request form.

Also, as discussed, requests for signing bonuses, retention bonuses, up-front 
grants by number of options rather than value, and guaranteed LTI awards are 
exceptions to the rules that the business units will need to justify before 
they will be approved.  Please do not make changes to these items or add any 
provisions to the standard short form without contacting Executive 
Compensation.

These procedures have been implemented at the request of the Office of the 
Chairman.  Consistent application of compensation standards and attention to 
the One Enron goal are key to our success.

Please pass this memo on to others who are impacted by this implementation.  
Sheila, would you please ensure that all Compensation Staff receive this?

Earline,

The questions are as follows:

1.  Has Enron provided Ecogas with such coverage for its non-Enron board 
members so far?
2.  What is the general scope of such coverage?

Ecogas is a stand-alone company.  Enron owns about 85 percent of its stock 
and has three people on its Board.

I hope that helps.

Michelle

OOps there were about 4 emails from Jim Bouillion that were forwarded to me

that is seeking coverage under Enron's D&O.  The same questions apply only 
change the name to Jerrel Branson.    We just need to know the chain of 
ownership to answer.  The Enron D&O policy is very broad.  

Thanks and sorry for adding to the confusion on this coverage question.

Is Enron North America the owner of ECOGAS 
If so what is the % ownership
Is Randal Maffett an Enron employee or is he an outside director/officer.  

We do cover outside directors but it depends on our ownership interest and if

To me the cost is irrelevant since Jerrel is the only Director affected and 
because of his actions (and/or lack thereof) the company can't afford to 
cover him.

Answering backwards - D&O insurance is exceedingly expensive for small firms
to secure, thus most do without it.  Second, it was a condition when we
closed and McConville/Lambert, et al researched it through Enron Risk
Management, Don Marshall, and stated that it was in place automatically for
any majority owned merchant investment.  A confirmation letter was promised
on 14 July and when pressed in September Lambert finally got around to
issuing the letter to Carl and me that I mentioned earlier.

I'm not very experienced in these matters so I'm checking with the folks
here.  Can you explain why Enron should cover non-Enron directors?  Why
doesn't Ecogas have its own insurance?  Any help you can provide is
appreciated.

Dee,

I left you a voice mail yesterday, but I wasn't sure if you were in.

There is a new deal -- Project E2/Endeavor.  It is in the preliminary stages, 
but the deal team (led by Don Miller) would like to have data regarding the 
average cost of Enron employee benefits, broken down by type of benefit, if 
possible.  I assume that you would have that type of data and could forward 
it to Don and me.

Let me know if I should be contacting someone else.

Thanks a lot!

Michelle

Mr. Del Vecchio,
?
We have received materials concerning the pension plan for non-union  
employees at Celgar. The company's latest actuarial report disclosed that as 
of  January 1, 2000:
?
1. The going-concern liabilities exceeded the actuarial value of assets  by? 
C$1,922,342; and
?
2.? The solvency liabilities exceeds the market value of plan assets  by? 
C$1,805,819.
?
We have also received the full text of the plan and its amendments.
?
Will you be reviewing these matters internally or shall we retain a local  
actuarial firm to perform the due diligence?

Thanks for the description.  Last night, I asked Trey about it, and we went 
onto Amazon.com to look at it.  It looks like a cool toy that Cameron would 
enjoy.  FYI:  the price at Amazon was way less than the price at etoys.  As a 
matter of fact, I told Trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to 
DC in August!  But, we can wait til Christmas, so go ahead with your plans.

Congrats on the furniture.  I am sure that you will be happy with it and will 
love the new look. 

See ya.  Michelle

Leap pad looks like an open book when placed in a child's lap.  There is an
attached pen type instrument which the child can use to point to various
things on the pages and also to indicate whether he/she would like the word
to be pronounced, spelled or sounded.  It comes with a book but other books
can be purchased to be placed in the pad.  That's the best description I can
give since I have never used one.  Check it out when you go to the toy
store.  Good news - several pieces of our living/dining  room furniture are
being delivered tomorrow with all new coordinated materials!  Happy art

Under the OWBPA or one of the laws similar to it, we have to present 
statistics to the employees over 40 who were offered the package.  Gloria, 
could you pull together two lists: one would have the names, titles and ages 
of everyone offered the package (Mo and the FX guys) and the other list will 
be the names, titles and ages of everyone else in the US in Enron Metals 
(including ST. Louis and Chicago but excluding Los Angeles), the people who 
were not offered it.  I know that we do not have titles for some of the 
Rudolph wolff folks at this time; please try to get their old titles at RW 
from the RW HR guy and we will use them.  We will need to submit this to 
Michelle Cash soon; we have to give that data to Mo before we can finalize 
his package.

Thanks

Hoyt,

As we discussed, even though Mo and Penner are not part  of this initial 
round, to be on the safe side, we should provide them with data regarding all 
persons in the group (defined as the New York office) who are provided with a 
release and those who are not.  The data should include age and title of 
persons offered packages, and then a separate list of age and titles of 
persons who are not offered packages.

Once this data is pulled together, I will be happy to review it to ensure 
compliance with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act, as the DOL has 
interpreted it.

Thanks.

Michelle

		 Subject: Section 5.14 of Stock Purchase Agreement between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Resources

I spoke with Keith Fullenweider at V&E regarding PGE's discharge of 
liabilities, and whether or not a consent would be required from Sierra 
Pacific Resources pursuant to Section 5.14 of the Stock Purchase Agreement.  
He agreed that settlement of this type of liability by PGE in the amounts 
discussed would not be material to PGE (even settlements with a broader group 
of individuals).  Payments made by PGE prior to the closing should not have 
any impact on Sierra's ownership of PGE or the value of PGE after closing.  
Enron has the right to dividend net income out of PGE before closing (up to 
certain limits).  Payment of liabilities would probably reduce the amount 
that Enron could dividend before closing.  Its not clear whether or not  the 
materiality standard was intended to be material to PGE and PGH II taken as a 
whole.  The amounts could be material to PGH II, but we assume that this 
would not be paid out of PGH II.  

I believe that the benefit plan at issue here is sponsored by Portland 
General Holdings, Inc.  That entity is not being sold to Sierra Pacific 
Resources.  I do not know whether or not there will be any employees that 
participate in that plan after PGE and PGH II are sold to Sierra.  Sierra 
will cause a new plan with similar benefits to be adopted at the time of the 
sale for PGE and PGH II employees.  I suppose that the plan sponsored by 
Portland General Holdings, Inc. might be terminated following the sale of PGE.

Please call me if you have further questions regarding the Stock Purchase 
Agreement between Enron and Sierra Pacific Resources.

(for some reason, the version she signed is not the intialled version that I 
think you sent to Sam recently).  I can fax to you the document, as she has 
signed it, for a final check.  Please let me know your preference.  I am in 
the SF office this week - (415)782-7800, or page (800)316-0430.  Thanks.  --

David,  I am with you.  In fact, I sent this issue to outside counsel earlier 
this week because I simply wasn't able to get to it due to the issues 
surrounding the latest reorg/redeployment efforts.  I expect an answer by 
Monday or Tuesday.  Sorry I forgot to let you know about the status.  Michelle

Michelle,

This is the first of 2 messages we are looking for your input on, can you 
advise when can we anticipate a response to Diane's questions?  At this point 
it is too late to make configuration changes for the 7/1 go-live but we 
wanted to get your feedback so that if we are not in compliance we can get 
the corrections on the schedule for post 7/1. 

Your assistance, as always,  is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Shift Differentials and Overtime Payment

Michelle,

We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime 
for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for 
assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who 
rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario.

For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the 
Night (N) shift.


  M T W Th F S

REG  8 8 8 8 8 
OT       8 
SHIFT  N N D D D D 


Interpretation 1

The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular 
rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)


Interpretation 2

Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as 
follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)

Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have 
totally missed the boat on both of them?

Thanks for your help,
Diane

Yikes!!!!   I can understand your preoccupation with those issues out there.  
I am sure that you are all "talked out" about it, but if you need an 
empathetic ear, give me a buzz.  Talk to you later.

I'd like to wait until we get legal opinion first.  Once we know there are no 
DOL/ERISA issues (or at least some we can manage), we can set-out the process 
flow and then the companies.  I'll coordinate a conference call -- but let's 
do this after the holidays.  So many of the players are not here at the same 
time and I am sure payroll has as many year end issues as we do right now.

(Sheri, please contact Michelle Cash and Pat Mackin to get available dates 
and then set-up a conference call including the above people as well as Mikie 
Rath and Dolores Lenfest.  We probably need to do this as soon as possible in 
the new year.  Can you also include Jane Pleli, Joann Hill and Sherry 
Lessner, there may be issues with us changing current environment prior to 
7/1/2000 that we need to consider.)

Subject: Re: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals  

For the employees to be provided with domestic benefits, they could just be 
placed on the standard domestic payroll, whereas the employees not to have 
domestic benefits could be on the new company.  As Cynthia states below, the 
new company (as a whole) would not be adopting benefit plans.  Logistically, 
there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires 
on the correct company.

Also, the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once SAP 
Payroll comes online 7/1.  Currently, there is some manual intervention when 
charging from one company (like Expat Services) to the appropriate accounting 
company.

Mike

The not making them eligible for domestic benefits is easy.  The new payroll 
company will simply not adopt the plans.  I am assuming that the number of 
employees (nor associated demographics) in this company will not create a 
discrimination problem.    

One question though, will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you 
want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not.  If 
the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps.

Let me know if we can help.

Subject: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals

As Enron expands globally, we are faced with a growing issue of more and more 
foreign nationals entering the US on varied lengths of assignment.  For some, 
it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain 
retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash 
balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the 
fact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on 
their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method 
to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well 
as receive US $.

Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a 
portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is 
paid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No 
FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.  
Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as 
they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, 
health/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment 
agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.

I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be 
possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign 
nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a 
mechanism to:

receive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account
pay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare
not make them eligible for domestic benefits

I would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.

Thanks,

Jane

McConville's counsel has asked us for language in addition to a mere

ENA to the effect that we will cooperate or at least not unreasonably oppose 
Kevin's making a claim for indemnification should the situation arise.  I 
have drafted language along the lines of what I think he is asking for.  Is 
this something that we would consider agreeing to?

Cheryl,

Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.  I 
had a blast with you being here.

I hope that you didn't get sick -- I'd feel awful if you did.  I still have 
the sniffles, but managed to avoid the worst of it (so far).  Cameron perked 
right up after the antibiotics kicked in.   He is his usual self today 
(happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend --  you really saw him at his 
worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on 
the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.

I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the 
rough time here last weekend.  When we're not sick, we're really much more 
fun!!  Besides, the pig races await.

gotta go.

Michelle

OK, so maybe I haven't kept in touch lately - but there's a pretty good
reason for it.  I've been working for a new company called SmartPrice.com,
and we've been pushing hard to get our web site launched.    Now that we've
officially launched, I want to make sure my friends are the first to come by

Now that you know what's been keeping me so busy, I hope you'll come to the
site and start saving money.  I think you'll find it's worth it - so far,
our customers have saved an average of 30% on their long distance bills by
using our service.

Dear Gretchen:  

Wow!  You are thinking ahead!  What is a Leap Pad?  Is it something computer 
related? I have never heard of it.

On our end, we have planned a trip to DC to visit Madison in August -- nice 
and hot by then.  We just got word that we have tix to the Orioles game while 
we are there, so that is good.  We got new furniture in the living room -- a 
chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman.  It amplified the need 
for bright art in that room -- to the galleries and starving artists sales we 
go!

Stay cool -- Michelle

Hi!? The heat has gotten to us!? We are  thinking Christmas.? We would like 
to give C a Leap Pad if he doesn't have  one and you and T think it would be 
appropriate.? The item is for ages 4  and up but we do not think C is too 
young for it and hopefully it will get him  to read more.? Nothing exciting 
happening here.? Just waiting, waiting  for furniture, materials, etc.? Takes 
forever as you well know.?  What's happening your end?? G?

 I received a call from Gene Diers today about what he believes may be going 
on with changes to my Agreement for Project Services ("APS") and how we 
operate.  There are business and legal reasons for the APS  being in the name 
of Enron Corp.  If we sell a company and the APS was in the name of a 
subsidiary, we would have to get the sold subsidiary to license the computer 
software to us.  Given the inability to determine this at the time everyone 
is pushing to sell the subsidiary, we could end up without any software or 
having to pay a substantial amount of money to the buyer later on when we 
discover the mistake.  Secondly, allowing all subsidiaries to negotiate 
different versions with vendors would be a nightmare and create five times 
the number of agreements to file.  I am opposed to this.  Every time we sell 
a company, the software has always been an issue.  We are as I told you 
before trying to fix something that is not broken.

What is your suggestion regarding disseminating the message to all other 
Enron Companies that part-time employees from the staff level on up (all 
exempt positions) should be paid on a salaried basis?   I could use your 
input on this.    I called Brian Schaeffer approx. 1 month ago and he said he 
was aware of the situation and that changes were going to be made but, I've 
not heard anything about how the message is being communicated to other Enron 
companies.

Thanks for the info.  I just need simple, basic frames.  No decorations or 
anything.  That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor, 
theme, time of year, etc.  So, painted wood or black resin probably are the 
best.  I could use 5x7" the most.

Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may 
want to find a game for the new machine.  Also, since it has a DVD player 
attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.  I already got him Being John 
Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.

We are looking forward to your visit.  Trey, Cameron and I are going to the 
Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.  Do you and Marianne want to go?  I am sure 
that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could 
get tickets if you are interested.  Let me know.

See you later.

Michelle

Hi, Brooks.

He wants the newest Lyle Lovett album -- the soundtrack to Dr. T and the
Women.  Also, he is getting a Playstation II from me for his birthday (they
don't come out until this week, so he doesn't have it yet), so you could
find him a game for the new system.  He has said that he wants a new clock
radio, with AM/FM (I don't think he wants CD/tape player on it), with
battery backup -- Sony would be best.  Also, he always wears short-sleeved
Polo shirts, size XL.  He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he
never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue.

Let me know if you need any other suggestions.

We are looking forward to your visit, especially Cameron.  He always is
talking about how Santa is going to bring presents for him and Madison!
Take care, and say "hi" to Marianne.

Michelle,

It looks like there are a lot of deal issues to be negotiated.  You have a
good hand on the legal issues for the employment matters.  If a form of
indemnity is required, make it very broad to cover all risks, including, but
not limited to, selection, unlawful discrimination and for permitting
tortuous interference with employment.

I assume that you have received my November 1 memo regarding Bidder D.
Redlined SPA.

I listened in on the labor relations call yesterday, but there didn't seem to
be anything for me to comment on.  I do have one observation about the call.
While I don't know anything about the transaction, the conversation about
employment and benefits would have been facilitated if Enron had previously
submitted a written schedule of all of the documents and information Enron
required in completing its due diligence review, and used that written
schedule to make reference to the data that has not yet been received.

Enron should not let the other side's data schedule or lack of a complete
schedule control Enron's due diligence agenda.  Enron should know in advance
what information it wants and use a check off sheet to manage the due
diligence process.  That way, the other side will better understand what
Enron expectations are.

I use this kind of data management tool all of the time and it is very
helpful to be able to refer to when it was presented to the other side, how
long they have had it and what items are still missing.

I heard nothing like that in the conference call yesterday.  It was though
people were thinking of things as the conversation went along.


Pat

Andrea, 

You are right.  I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I 
was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who 
was setting up the meeting.  I apologize for the oversight -- it was not 
intentional.  I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent 
meetings.  I am sorry about this one.  

Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a 
compensation system or a feedback system?  Because the process tries to 
address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp, 
promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This 
tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the 
fact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people 
lots of heartburn.  

To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create 
too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that 
comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we 
evaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead 
of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and 
the comparative rating.  For example, a "strong" performer really could be 
excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third 
category.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be 
problematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the 
categories to get away from the old "HR" language.  For example, a category 1 
performer would have a descriptor that said something like:  "Always raises 
the bar; franchise player," etc. rather than a "HR" definition relating to 
demonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and 
issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference 
between the two.

There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem 
more competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC 
appeared to be a "black box," and the desire to explain and communicate more 
about the process.

This was only the first meeting.  I will make sure that you are invited to 
attend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

Subject: Potential Change of Cluster Descriptors for PRC Reviews

As I noted, I attended a meeting yesterday to discuss the possibility of 
changing the current descriptors used in PRC (Superior through Issues) to a 
numeric rating 1-6 (or possibly 1-5 by combining the Needs Improvement and 
Issues categories).  The numeric ratings would be based on more relative 
behavioral descriptors to categorize an employee's performance, and not the 
absolute standards that the current descriptors represent.  

I have been tasked with drafting the verbiage for this possible change which 
will, of course, require review and approval by the senior levels of the 
organization.  In the interim I would appreciate knowing how this change 
might affect the system and current development  and compatibility of the 
data from mid-year to year end, assuming the change is approved.

I look forward to your comments and input.  Thanks in advance,

Gina

		 Subject: Section 5.14 of Stock Purchase Agreement between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Resources

I spoke with Keith Fullenweider at V&E regarding PGE's discharge of 
liabilities, and whether or not a consent would be required from Sierra 
Pacific Resources pursuant to Section 5.14 of the Stock Purchase Agreement.  
He agreed that settlement of this type of liability by PGE in the amounts 
discussed would not be material to PGE (even settlements with a broader group 
of individuals).  Payments made by PGE prior to the closing should not have 
any impact on Sierra's ownership of PGE or the value of PGE after closing.  
Enron has the right to dividend net income out of PGE before closing (up to 
certain limits).  Payment of liabilities would probably reduce the amount 
that Enron could dividend before closing.  Its not clear whether or not  the 
materiality standard was intended to be material to PGE and PGH II taken as a 
whole.  The amounts could be material to PGH II, but we assume that this 
would not be paid out of PGH II.  

I believe that the benefit plan at issue here is sponsored by Portland 
General Holdings, Inc.  That entity is not being sold to Sierra Pacific 
Resources.  I do not know whether or not there will be any employees that 
participate in that plan after PGE and PGH II are sold to Sierra.  Sierra 
will cause a new plan with similar benefits to be adopted at the time of the 
sale for PGE and PGH II employees.  I suppose that the plan sponsored by 
Portland General Holdings, Inc. might be terminated following the sale of PGE.

Please call me if you have further questions regarding the Stock Purchase 
Agreement between Enron and Sierra Pacific Resources.

Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the 
end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.  We also hire 
consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is 
pretty long for a consultng position.  What is the situation?  Maybe we can 
find an alternative.

Michelle -

Do we ever do fixed term offers?  I got a question today from RD Hawkins as 
LasVegas Cogen asking if we could hire someone for a one year period of 
time.  I know we can do it in the UK, just not sure about the US.

Thanks!
Amy

Kerry, this is the second of two messages.   Do you have any thoughts?  
Michelle




Michelle  - Can you review the following examples as well?  USO means 
unscheduled overtime, UPG means upgrade and the UO1 means Upgrade Overtime.
If I should be forwarding these to someone else, please let me know.

Subject: Upgrades on night shifts with overtime

Diane,

I.  We need help with the following:

1) Employee works night shift  (12 SH2)
     Same employee is on an upgrade (12 UPG)
     Same employee works overtime

What would the overtime entry look like, and what would be the rate 
computation for the above employee?  

Assumptions:

A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour
SH2   $1/hr
UO1 $350  $   5.40/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
UPG $350  $   2.19/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)


  W F S S

REG   12 12 12
SH2  N N N N
UPG  12 12 12 12 
USO  12
UO1  12  

It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).

The UO1 would be calculated at $64.80 (5.40x12).

Second example for this scenario:

A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour
SH2   $1/hr
UO1 $350  $   5.40/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
UPG $350  $   2.19/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)


  W F S S

REG   12 12 12
SH2  N N N N 
UPG  12 12 
USO  12    2
UO1  12       

It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).

The UO1 would be calculated at $64.80 (5.40x12).

The USO would be calculated at $76.59 (25.53x1.5x2 hours)



2)  Employee works night shift
      Same employee works overtime

     Does the overtime rate take shift differential into account?

     We've got timesheets that show an employee who worked on a night shift 
for 12 hours.  This was the employee's off day.

     The code was 12 SH2 (for night shift)
                                   12 USO (for overtime)

      Are these time entries correct? Yes.  What would be the rate 
computation for the above employee?


The overtime would need to account for the shift differential.  For the week 
in question Jan 17-23 he has the following hours:

  W F S S

REG   12 12 12 
SH2  N N N N 
USO  12 
                                     
This ees salary is as follows:

A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour

It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).

Pat,

I have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate 
email.  I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given 
your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.  In terms of 
timing, your comments probably can go into the next draft, but if you have a 
chance to look at 4.14 today, it would be great!

Thanks a lot!

Michelle

Attached is a mark-up of the PSA with Bidder A, which incorporates most of
the Bidder A's comments.  As discussed, we have attempted to include those
comments proposed by Bidder A when possible and yet preserve the more
important "materiality protections for Seller.   The draft is marked against
Seller's bid document form, however, I have asked Lehman to send to me
electronically the Bidder A form.  Upon receipt, I will prepare and
distribute to you a compare-rite which will show the Bidder A comments which
we didn't accept.  In this draft, please note the following:

1.  Enron should confirm and advise whether the delayed closing date (April
2001) as reflected in Section 3.1 is acceptable.

2.  The tax provisions  include V&E's comments, however Enron Tax personnel
should consider carefully the "after tax basis" concept and definition,
Section 4.9 and Article 11.

3.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the
proper thresholds and amounts for (i) the Deductible Amount, (ii) the
liability cap, (iii) Section 4.13 and Section 6.3.

4.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the
provisions in Section 4.16 (Insurance) including the continuing post-closing
insurance obligations.

5.  The appropriate Enron personnel should advise us regarding the proper
procedures for Buyer to participate (observatory capacity) in the
post-signing business in accordance with Section 7.15.

Once you have had the opportunity to review the attached agreement, please
give me a call to set up a time to discuss your comments and required
revisions.

FYI regarding the labor/employment lawyer for EBS -- according to Sharon, she 
was asked to be point person for EBS.  I'll let you know when I talk with 
Mark, which should be early next week upon his return from London.

Although we did not discuss it today in our meeting, I believe that Mary's 
group was looking for a point person for each operating company for the 
purpose of division of labor of the preparation of the executive employment 
agreements,  I recommended to Courtney today that  you  be the point person  
for Corp., Azurix, GPG and EE&CC.  I would like to be the point person for 
EES, EBS and Wind.  Of course,  as usual, we will continue to cover for each 
other and  work on what ever agreements come our way in order to get the 
agreements done.  I am sure that there are other operating companies that we 
should divide up but the big ones are noted above.  What do you think?

Jane,

When the Green Card Task Force was alive, we discussed a payback provision if 
the person left within two years after receiving a green card (voluntarily).  
Is this being done?  If not, I think we should talk about it, given all the 
time, energy, resources, funds, etc., being expended on getting a person a 
green card.

This is great!!!!

Can you believe all that is going on in Sunny Florida?  I called Nat/Laura to 
get their take on the mayhem, but I haven't been able to talk with them.  I 
got a voice mail from Laura that Jesse Jackson was leading a demonstration up 
the street from their house!  They are right in the thick of it.

Later.  MHC

or more. The changes addressed in this ASAP are quite technical and require
careful consideration.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

Privileged and Confidential
This email contains legal advice and confidentiality should be maintained

The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor 
Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be "represented" by a 
co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting.  Employees in 
unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended 
by the NLRB's ruling.

 The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be 
appealed quickly.  Nonetheless, if an Enron employee wants to have someone 
sit in on a disciplinary meeting, please call me to discuss how to proceed 
before responding to that request.  We want to be careful to avoid a finding 
of an unfair labor practice.

Thanks.  Michelle

Meeting at 2:00 Monday -- actually, I will need it by noon so that I can

Transactions

Major Events of September - November 2000

Garden State Paper -- closing and transition.

Triple Lutz -- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal 
discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on 
both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and 
discussions with clients.  Issues include salaries of employees hired by 
buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees 
(including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for 
divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.

Crane -- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.

Falcon -- review diligence reports, client discussions.

E2  -- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.


Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

Triple Lutz -- continued negotiations and document drafting.  Transition 
issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.  Litigation by 
persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not 
to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.

East Coast Power:  If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many 
transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP 
personnel.  Also, there will be transition issues for other services, 
including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.

Crane/Falcon -- could move forward; Crane is more likely.  Issues of labor 
unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.


Litigation

Major Events of September - November 2000

No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.

Non-compete litigation:  Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in 
Sharolyn Wood's court.  Suit filed, no TRO sought.  Service in process.

Minor litigation:  Marentz & Co. v. Enron.  Suit for non-payment of placement 
fee.  Maximum damages $75K.  Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered 
mediation to follow.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, 
as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.  

We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.



Documents Generated

Major Events of September - November 2000

New Consulting Services Agreement:  I prepared a new form of Consulting 
Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work 
Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from 
outside counsel as well as client group feedback.  I will finalize the 
agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.  

Standard Agreements:

I prepared:

  ___ draft employment agreements.

 ___ draft consulting services agreements.

  ___ separation agreement and releases.

 ___ retention letter agreements.

The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in 
trading.  My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person 
in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.  There 
are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our 
non-compete provisions. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of 
contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus 
pool.  

Investigations

Major Events of September - November 2000

Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:  I 
directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the 
company decided to employ them.  I and the team reviewed the results with 
Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of 
the consultants' surveys.  Sally Beck is contemplating communication to 
employees on results of survey.  [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]

Texaco Hacker:  We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the 
Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.  He then sent 
inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.  The investigation 
results led to termination of employment for cause.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated 
following PRC/bonus discussions. 


Training

Major Events of September - November 2000

 Increased role as trainer.  I provided interview training for all Net Works 
employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).  

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001  

EIM:  Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials 
Group.  The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition 
of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.  

All of Wholesale:  The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated 
early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.  Refresher 
training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went 
through the first round.

Pre-Hire Testing 

Major Events of September - November 2000

Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of 
screening out applicants.  I am working with the Training and Development 
groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.  I have suggested 
experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests 
will result in a successful employee.

Re-Skilling:  One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of 
potential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under 
Beth Perlman. 

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John 
Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&A 
program.


Employee Relations/Terminations  

Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination 
issues -- approximately 10-15 per week (total).  No two situations are alike, 
and they require significant time.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

After PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.  The 
company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on 
a performance improvement plan.  Generally, I review those before they are 
put in place.  If they are not successful, then terminations are likely 
(probably early in the first half of 2001).  Those issues are time-consuming 
and full of risks.

Work for Portfolio Assets

Major Events of September - November 2000

Ecogas:  wind-down issues.

Mariner:  Change of Control Agreements.

CGAS:  harassment prevention training -- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to 
provide training for CGAS personnel.

East Coast Power:  Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.

Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 2001

CGAS:  Revising employment agreements for key personnel.

Mariner:  Employment agreement negotiation.


Conclusions


ENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of 
manager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has 
placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement 
of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of 
manager or above.  

Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).

Net Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.  
I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be 
managed out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling 
and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure 
that risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that 
group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it 
may improve over time.

Contractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the 
work force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if 
contractors are allowed to stay on too long.

Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many 
employees in the "exempt" category who should be classified as "non-exempt."  
I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will 
not be an easy fix.

EIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of 
talent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle 
diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle 
the job.  

EGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other 
groups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make 
retention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to 
shorten the non-compete duration for this group.

Pat,

Here is the latest PSA draft for a 

We've agreed to pay $1mm of the severance.  We also have agreed to pay the 
cost of 2000 bonuses.  On options, there is a proposal for Enron to supervest 
the employees' options at closing -- can we agree to that? I didn't think 
so.  

your comments would be appreciated.

Subject: Have we got employees in the right Company?

Drew Lynch has asked that I coordinate a project to determine if we have 
employees in the correct companies (for U.S. companies) and do we know the 
ownership structure of both domestic and foreign companies.  We will approach 
this in three phases as below:

Phase I - On our payroll system - do we have employees in the correct 
companies in EPC and do we know which ones are wholly owned by Enron;

Phase II - Not on our payroll but in the U.S. -  do we know who the employees 
are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is structured;  

Phase III - Not on our payroll and outside the U.S. - do we know who the 
employees are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is 
  structured.

I would like to schedule a meeting next Wednesday.  I will have some 
preliminary work completed and would like to review it at that time.  Christa 
Aguilar will be contacting each of you to coordinate a date and time.  If you 
are not able to attend I would like for you to send a representative.  Please 
call me at ext. 39815 is you have any questions.

Pat, here is additional information about the transaction we have been 
working on.  Of course, they are going to finalize tomorrow.  I agree with 
your concerns about the tortious interference situation.  Do you have any 
suggestions on mitigating that risk?  My thought would be to request an 
indemnity for the t.i. claim if it is received.  Alternatively, we can ask 
for a waiver for all persons who are terminated and ask that  the buyer be a 
beneficiary/waived party.  Any ideas?

Generally speaking, nothing has changed since we last spoke.  One small 
change is currently contemplated however.   Seller has insisted that we give 
them a maximum number of non-union employees that we will want them to 
terminate.  We have suggested that the maximum number be 30.  This seems good 
at least for WARN Act purposes.  As it is currently contemplated (not in the 
documents but rather in the most recent negotiations), we would provide the 
Seller with written notice (no later than 3 or 4 business days before closing 
but after our financing contingency has expired) as to which employees would 
need to be terminated.  One other thing that I have heard is that we want the 
Seller to be the terminating party because the commercial folks would prefer 
not to have to tell our analysts that we did the firing.  If you and the 
other labor folks feel strongly about making the Buyer the terminating party, 
please call me ASAP and I can hook you in with Rodney Malcolm et al to 
discuss.  The deal is set to be finalized tomorrow.

Privileged and Confidential
This email contains legal advice

Hoyt and Melissa,

I am assuming that we are discussing contract personnel who provide some sort 
of services for MG/RW.  It looks like there may be some key personnel we want 
to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not 
really familiar with the specific facts here.

The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract 
personnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their 
activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and 
other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is 
to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an 
employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a 
supervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.

If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers 
-- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It 
is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting 
agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other 
alternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people 
who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk 
of the contract workers.

I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a 
definitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.  I am booked until about 
11 this morning, but am available after that.

Michelle

Subject: Priviliged and Confidential communication to my attorney Re: Henry

Melissa, my concern is that we may get hit with what is called a 
"co-employment suit" in the US.  This is where an agency employee claims that 
he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee 
benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).  
Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit 
against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would 
have to defend it.

I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can 
advise us on the position we should take.  I would think that if we single 
out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as 
agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency 
employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).  Michelle, can you 
help us with this one?  Thanks.

Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . .

Subject: Henry Bath LA

Hi Hoyt,

I have today spoken to Ed Dablin regarding Henry Bath LA.  We discussed how 
the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are 
infact agency workers.  Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other 
employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get 
applicable benefits.

The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should 
become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.

He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly "muddied 
the water" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or 
the agency.  He was not involved with the original decision to grant these 
employees Share Options.

We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the 
specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals 
Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy 
thing to do.  

However, this is his ideal scenario.  How viable is it that we can do this 
for him?

He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath 
Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees.

Regards

Melissa

Please clarify this issue that came out of the meeting on Friday:

My group heard the following statement:

If you get a comparable offer from the new company (same title and same 
salary) and you decline the offer then
you are basically resigning from Enron.  You will not be placed into the 
redeployment pool and you are not eligible for 
a severence package.

Sheila, do you think we should meet with Rick Buy about this?  Or, should we 
talk about it without Rick and then respond accordingly?  The bottom line is, 
that the non-compete probably should stay as is, even in the case of RAC.  
Let's discuss.  Michelle

I have reviewed the proposed contract and have the following comments:

 1) The numbers appear acceptable but only in context with the rest of my 
comments
 2) The language is such as to even give an illusion that I could act in an 
independent and objective manner
 3) There is no consideration given for the obligations to not compete, 
solicit customers and employees, and speak harsh words
 4) The length of the non-compete is ludicrous, i.e. it is so long that it 
makes no sense for Enron to pay someone for it and the marginal 6 months adds 
very   little incremental protection to Enron from a competition 
perspective.  This might be appropriate for a member of the Executive 
Committee.
 

Let me go into some more detail on the above.
Point #2
All of Senior Management has told outside constituents (The Board, 
Shareholders, Investment Analysts, Rating Agencies, Regulatory Agencies, 
Banks and Counterparties) that the RAC Group is independent of the Business 
Units.  That is, given that our job is to provide objective analysis of the 
business activities, it has provided great comfort to these interested 
parties that our judgment is not influenced by the people who are taking risk 
on behalf of the firm.  Individual compensation is the foundation of this 
independence.  These parties have made judgments to provide capital (dollar 
or otherwise) to us based on the knowledge that this group in this 
independent configuration exists and is effective.  It has been specifically 
cited in reports as a strength and we are asked to make dozens of 
presentations each year to that effect.   This is especially true in the 
Market Risk function because, unlike other transactions in the firm, there is 
no analysis and approval chain for risk taking other than coarse buckets and 
the valuation, direction, and volatility are so opaque.  Independence is a 
cornerstone of the G-30 recommendations on derivatives.  I believe that these 
parties are much more concerned with what they can't see as opposed to what 
they can. 
I believe that our claim to have an independent function would be jeopardized 
if my bonus were a function of earnings targets and a PRC full of trading 
MD's.
This should be a simple guaranteed minimum.  

Point #3
If Enron wants the right to keep me on the shelf for up to 12 months, then 
Enron needs to pay for it.  While I understand that sign on bonuses and 
retention bonuses are discouraged, I have firm evidence that low level 
commercial people are receiving both without any senior management approval.  
The amount should approximate the market price for the job (all in) for the 
period of the non-compete.  This follows to point #4 - I don't expect anyone 
to pay me such additional amounts equal to my "target" compensation for 12 
months ($500,000!!!!).   The right answer is to shorten the non-compete to a 
maximum of 6 months and pay me for that.  I think that it would be equally 
stupid for Enron to not have the right to put me on the shelf for a 
considerable period of time given that I have and must continue to have 
complete access to all positions, p&l and the underlying contracts.   I would 
consider giving Enron the option (for a smaller premium) to have me 
non-compete which, if exercised, would trigger a larger payment.

There are some other smaller points that I have discussed with Sheila Walton 
which can be addressed later.

Please give your consideration to these items asap as I my old contract has 
expired.

Marty,

Gracie Presas is asking about training for ENA for harassment.  As we 
discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron 
global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency.  So, I told her to call you.

The lawyer contact on this is Kerry Notestine at Littler Mendelson.  His 
number is 713-652-4748.  Thanks.

Michelle

Dick, Here are the details about the GPG PRC meeting.  Please note that these 
people have not been involved in the process for very long and thus, this may 
not be the best example of how the process works.  Nonetheless, it should 
give you a flavor of how it works.  When you get to the Enron Building, 
please ask for me or my assistant, Twanda Sweet, and one of us will take you 
to the conference room.  Thanks a lot!  Michelle

David/Cindy, 

I have arranged for Dick Jeanrette, who is an industrial psychologist 
specializing in employment matters, to assist us in the performance 
evaluation process.  Dick has worked for years with Exxon, which has a 
process that sounds similar to ours, and has many ideas regarding the 
process.  The Exxon process has been challenged in court, and Dick has 
testified about its process; the cases have been in favor of the company.  
Thus, I believe his experience and insight will help us in our performance 
management process.

I will be arranging a meeting with Dick in the next two weeks.  Besides the 
persons identified in this email, who should attend?  You had mentioned Steve 
Kean.  Should he be involved as well?  (FYI, he worked with Dick on Project 
One).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

Subject: PRC Descriptors

Michelle,

I had a voicemail from Cindy and Steve Kean relating to the change of wording 
on the Satisfactory and Needs Improvement descriptors for this mid-year 
review. Concern surrounds the apparent toughening of Satisf in particular and 
a belief that this makes distributing names into bottom 2 categories harder.

I recall we changed wording due to some concerns you had expressed. Perhaps 
you can restate them here for everyone.

However, regardless of above I remain of opinion that descriptors and labels 
are proving a distraction from what should be a more relative process. 
Perhaps the main message here is to convey something that helps us put these 
descriptors in the context of a guide only (starting point or indicative 
illustration) rather than absolute scale. 

Bottom-line it is rather difficult to see how we could change any of this for 
the mid year.

David

Ruling Helps Workers Prove Job Bias

By RICHARD CARELLI
.c The Associated Press

WASHINGTON (June 12) - Workers who say their employers illegally
discriminated against them can win lawsuits, or at least get their
accusations to a jury, without direct evidence of intentional bias, the
Supreme Court ruled Monday.

The court's unanimous decision in an age-bias dispute from Mississippi could
carry profound practical importance as well for lawsuits nationwide that
charge employment discrimination based on race, sex and physical disabilities.

The ruling was a huge setback for employers because some federal appeals
courts routinely had dismissed lawsuits that lacked ''smoking gun'' evidence
of employers' discriminatory intent.

Monday's decision said circumstantial evidence often is enough to sue
employers successfully.

Employer organizations were disappointed.

''The bottom line is ... it may be tougher to get cases out of the hands of
the jury,'' said Peter Petsch, a lawyer for the Society for Human Resource
Management. ''In some jurisdictions, we're going to see more litigation ...
which lasts longer, even for employers who did nothing wrong,'' he said.

But Thomas Osborne, an AARP lawyer, praised the decision as a victory for the
some 12 million over-50 workers who belong to his organization because it
''says employers no longer can lie about their personnel decisions and get
away with it.''

''The playing field is no longer slanted toward employers,'' Osborne said.

In a series of employment-bias decisions, the nation's highest court has
imposed various requirements on employees who say they were treated
illegally. They must show they were subjected to adverse treatment and that
the employer's asserted reason for such treatment was phony.

But federal appeals courts have disagreed on a key point:
whether employees who discredit an employer's stated reason must also offer
proof of a discriminatory motive. Not always, the Supreme Court said Monday.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that a federal appeals court wrongly relied
on ''the premise that a plaintiff must always introduce additional,
independent evidence of discrimination.''

''Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply
one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional
discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive,'' she said. ''In appropriate
circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer form the falsity of the
explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory
purpose.''

O'Connor said employees will not always be entitled to win a job-bias lawsuit
after showing that an employer's explanation for their treatment was false.
But she ruled that it was enough in the case of a Mississippi man who said
age discrimination cost him his supervisory job at a toilet-seat
manufacturing plant.

Roger Reeves sued Sanderson Plumbing Products of Columbus, Miss., after he
was fired in 1995 from his job as a hinge-department supervisor in the plant.
Reeves, then 57, had worked at the plant for 40 years.

His lawsuit invoked the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and a
jury awarded him $70,000 in damages and $28,490 in lost pay.

But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that award after ruling
that Reeves had not offered enough proof of illegal age bias.

Reeves had been required to prove he was over 40 and therefore protected by
the federal law, that he had been fired and replaced with someone younger.
Such evidence amounted to what courts call a ''prima facie'' showing of
discrimination.

Sanderson Plumbing then was required to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory
reason for the firing. Once it did, the burden shifted back to Reeves to show
that the stated reason was false.

He also pointed to derogatory comments made about his age by a supervisor.

Company officials said Reeves had been fired for falsifying time records but
he showed that he had not.

The jury apparently concluded that he succeeded in proving bias, but the
appeals court said Reeves had to also offer proof that the company's decision
was motivated by age bias.

Monday's decision said the appeals court was wrong about that, and reinstated
the jury's verdict.

Alan,

Attached is the resume of Charles Glizzard, a candidate that would like to be 
considered for a Global Markets legal position.  We should probably consider 
him for the role of Marine Transportation specialist, but it appears his 
skill set also shows an ability to do quite a bit more for us.

Kind regards,
Dan

Jennifer,

Thanks for the email.  Cameron is great.  He loves his new school, even 
though it is not as "working parent friendly" as Cathedral House was. 

Cameron also loves fire engines (and ambulances, and tow trucks, and 
bulldozers and ..... ).  We took Cameron to the Bellaire EMS Open House a few 
weeks ago.  He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the 
driver's seat and "drive."   They also handed out plastic fireman's hats.   
He had a blast!

I look forward to having you back on 36;  I'm moving there as soon as they 
get my phone/computer set up -- I'll spend half days there.

See you later.

Michelle

Michelle,

Thanks for continuing to include me on these mailing lists - We are still 
snowed under on the PEP team (feedback ends on Friday and everyone has waited 
until the last minute...), but I hope to attend these information sessions 
after the Mid Year process is concluded.

How is Cameron?  Jack is turning 4 in two weeks and I can't believe how 
quickly time passes.  He is obsessed with fire engines and we are visiting a 
fire station for his birthday.  I am now the resident expert on fire safety 
and hydrant locations...

I feel rather isolated off in Allen Center, but we will return to 
civilization in August, so perhaps we can meet for lunch.

Thanks,
Jennifer

As we discussed, I am sending you a letter summarizing the law related to
double-breasted issues, with particular focus on operating two companies in
the same geographic and project market.  I also have included some
information, as you requested, about the potential liability if the efforts
to maintain double-breasted status fail.

I will send the original of this letter to you by mail.  I have copied this
letter to Michelle Cash but have not sent it to anybody else in your
organization because of your prior comments about David Lund's direct

The CFO of Power Systems Manufacturing is  Wayne Garrett.

John Howton is forwarding your e:mail to Wayne's attention to review and 
answer questions.  Wayne and I both feel that this is a clean transfer of 
employees.  The story is as follows:

1.  They are payroll by ADP in Fort Lauderdale.  The representative is Sonia 
Vassell (954) 717-6975.  The code that they are currently using is PXU for 
processing payroll.  These employees are paid bi-weekly.

2.   Benefits = Health, Dental and Life in which Wayne does not have a 
problem with continuing to pay their benefits until the end of the year.  
This will allow us approximately 1 1/2 months to set the AMPS company up 
(effective 1/1/2001).

3.  Vacation is 15 days which include sick and vacation.  Wayne company will 
pay any accrued vacation given us a chance to determine how we want to 
structure vacation effective 1/1/2001.

4. 401K is administered by Fidelity.  There is not a company match.  So, we 
can figure out how  to handle 401k going forward.

5.  Disburse Power is the holding company that Wayne has set up to hold these 
employees until AMPS is established.

I asked John Howton who is responsible for getting the joint venture company 
"AMPS" set up and he will call me back with that answer.  Maybe you know the 
answer.

It seems to me that this is a clean set up.  We need to determine how we want 
to process their payroll, how to handle benefits and which policies we want 
to put in place for these employees.  John has a spreadsheet with employee 
information that he will forward to our attention. 

I know you will have more detailed questions and we will need to funnel 
everything through John Howton.

Let's schedule a time to discuss in more detail tomorrow.

Sharon/Kriste,

If there are going to be revisions to the leave policy, I suggest that we 
make major ones, including a segregation of FMLA leave from other types of 
leave --i.e., two separate policies.  Let's talk about this on Tuesday ----- 
Majorly important!!

Subject: Leave Policy

Here are a few edits to the Approved Time Off and Leaves of Absence policy.

Benefits has not included a "second or third opinion by another health care 
provider paid for by the Company" as it has significant implications to our 
LTD plan and has created at least one problem that I am aware of in the past.
We will need to think through what the certification document might look like 
and would look to you for some guidelines.   The concern I have is around 
privacy and use of information given potential regulation.
Cynthia believes that we should run FMLA concurrent with sick time.  I agree 
and have noted that in the document.   

Sharon, could you please review the wording to ensure I haven't missed 
something here from a legal perspective.  I will follow-up with you by phone 
shortly.  

Susan, here are the "long-since promised" wording changes we propose.     

Thanks,

Elaine

 By the way, I talked with Marty last week about Bashen's files.  He said 
that they were on the way to him and he would forward to me immediately.  
Therefore, I expect to get them any day now.  I assume I should review 
immediately; let me know if you think otherwise.

Re:  Project Canary - Interim Legal Due Diligence and Transaction Analysis 
for the Celgar Pulpmill.

Further to our e-mail of last evening forwarding the above report and the 
enclosed hard copies of this report which you will have received by courier 
this morning, enclosed for replacement of the existing document at Tab 1 is a 
revised version of our overview memorandum.  At the time of sending our 
document last evening I did not yet have our real estate report.  This 
portion of the report has been incorporated.  This document should therefore 
replace the existing document at Tab 1.

Second, enclosed is a more detailed labour/employment due diligence report 
which should replace the existing document at Tab 4 of your binder.

Third, enclosed is a more detailed real estate due diligence report which 
should be placed at Tab 5 of your binder.

Finally, enclosed is a more detailed review of the banking documents and 
security which should be placed at Tab 10.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.

Hi, Charla,

I have reviewed the additional fields you described.  Most of them look fine 
with me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, 
citizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.  

The questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have 
discussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin 
discrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from 
any other source.  It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking 
questions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity.  
What is the purpose of this inquiry?  Are we trying to determine whether  a 
person is eligible to work in a particular country?  If so, it appears that 
birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.  We already have 
a field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the 
situation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work 
visa to another.   Any other information may not be necessary.

The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth 
information that we really don't want to keep on a system.  For example, if a 
person left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it 
really is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is 
there a less intrusive way to ask it?   

Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is 
asking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that 
inquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?

Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be 
unwise for the reasons I cited above.  If you would like to discuss this 
further, please give me a call.

Michelle

Jane - is there anything you wish to add or change at this point?

Tim - I will run these by Mike to see what SAP can incorporate in the future 
(particularly Demographics).

Kathy - Please advise how you envision this process to work; it might be a 
good idea to discuss the various ways this information could be laid out - 
thanks!

WORK DESCRIPTIONS (LONG AND SHORT FORM)



	


I talked briefly to Carmen this morning about plans to revise the above 
agreements and associated arrangements for processing them. ]

Since I am retiring on June 30, 2000, I have no territorial interest in what 
happens but I think I would be remiss if I didn't at least offer a couple of 
comments: 

1.  Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some 
has been effective.  It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an 
agreement.  This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which 
vendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which 
we treat different vendors.  I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide 
and conquer approach. 

2.  The agreements need to be updated.  I know that there are some reasons 
for using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR 
PROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could 
be worked out.  It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is 
some duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., 
all things that could be fixed rather easily. 

3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover 
all kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.

4.  If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an 
arrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement 
but the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for 
anything that they might do on the PWD. 

I realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what 
it is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view 
it with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking 
a methodology that has served us.

Thanks.  gene

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

How about this:

Any future grant/payment described on this worksheet is subject to 
appropriate committee approvals and previously-defined performance standards; 
the use of the term "guaranteed" on this worksheet does not modify the terms 
and conditions of any such payment/grant.

Too wordy?

Michelle --

Per our conversation, the term sheets list any future grants/bonus payments 
as outlined in employment agreements.  The description that prints along with 
the amount may say "Guaranteed Grant".  Of course we all know that it's 
contingent upon Admin/Comp Committee approval.  However, to keep down any 
question, we thought about adding an asterick and saying:

John,

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice 
mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of 
issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits 
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for 
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain 
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there 
another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references 
from prior employers, etc.)?  

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that 
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the 
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine 
how to proceed.

Michelle

Michelle-

Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for 
your consideration.  I am unsure as to the types of testing contemplated, but 
want to ensure that such activities are permitted under Enron's policy.

Your comments on the attached agreement would also be appreciated.  

Thanks,

John

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to 
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes 
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment 
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed 
to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our 
use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you 
review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also 
appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with 
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it 
in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

Michelle - Welcome back from vacation!

Gary Buck suggested that I approach you for guidance regarding a background 
investigation report we have received on a contractor candidate for 
Networks.  The report indicates that 8/14/95, the candidate was found guilty 
of theft, a misdemeanor.  He was sentenced to 3 days jail and fined $200.  
The candidate indicated on his Contractor Information Sheet that he had a 
misdemeanor from 1995.  

Should we have the recruiter contact the candidate and ask for more 
information about the misdemeanor, or should we simply reject him?

Thanks for your assistance.

Remember the issue with the second opinion on antitrust that we had on the

the other law firm that did the opinion.  You indicated that you had known
about the opinion, but expected something much less expensive.  Of course,
we also sent you the bill several months after the matter concluded.  Any
indication if Enron will pay any part of that bill?  If not, let me know, so

Cheryl,

I am taking 12/1 off as a vacation day -- so, let's play!!!  I have a hair 
appointment Saturday, which I cannot really change this late in the year.  
So, do you want to get a haircut, manicure, or anything else beautifying 
while you are here?  If so, I'll book something for you.  

There is no way we would have you babysit.  In fact, we have a  sitter for 
Saturday night. so we can go somewhere fun for dinner and maybe even see a 
movie or do anything else you may want to do.

I can't wait for your visit!!

Michelle

I am not comfortable with bringing someone in without an agreement.  I should 
have a draft to you this afternoon at the latest, so it should not be a

Hi Bryce,

In discussing the difficulties in getting this contract in place to meet
both your needs and Mr. Lloyds, it was brought to my attention that since we
have already established a good working relationship with Enron that we
would not have a problem allowing Mr. Lloyd to begin working without an
official contract in place.  I do not know how your management would feel
about a letter of proposal, which would serve as a temporary work
authorization until the final contract is in place but it is something that
ESC is willing to do.  Assuming Ms. Cash is able to pull together the Master
Service Agreement by Monday and everything is agreeable to ESC then it
obviously would not be necessary to implement a temporary work
authorization.  However, should we run into further obstacles, I wanted to
share with you this possible opportunity.

One of the things that I wanted to discuss with you is your remaining
staffing requirements.  I am not sure I have a clear picture of the exact
skills you are looking for and would like to avoid sending you resumes which
do meet your needs.  Also, how many candidates are you looking to bring on?

I look forward to hearing from you, hopefully we'll be luckier with the
phones next week...

Thank You,

Subject:  Enron Investment Partners Long Term Incentive Plan;
    Deferral of Payouts Under Enron Corp. Deferral Plan


Michelle, Carol Jewett called me this morning about including a provision i=
n
the long term incentive plan ("LTIP") being established for Enron Investmen=
t
Partners (old Enron Development Corp.) to permit deferral of payouts under
the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.

I suggested to Carol that such a provision in the LTIP would not be
appropriate or sufficient; that the tail cannot wag the dog.  If such
deferrals are to be permitted, they would have to be authorized and made
under the provisions of the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.  Also, there are som=
e
additional issues discussed below.

Any compensatory arrangement that by design or practice defers payment of t=
he
benefit until or beyond termination of an employee=01,s employment is consi=
dered
to be a "pension plan" under ERISA.

ERISA contains complex and challenging administrative, participation and
funding requirements  (which most employers want to avoid) for such non-tax
qualified pension plans.  The way to avoid these requirements is to design
such a compensatory program, such as a deferral plan, so that it is a "top
hat" plan which is exempt, not from ERISA, but from the more onerous
requirements.

For example, only employees who meet the "top hat" definition are permitted
to participate in the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.  Enron Corp. is not willin=
g
to let all employees who participate in the LTIP make deferrals to the Enro=
n
Corp. Deferral Plan.  Any participant in the LTIP who wants to defer a payo=
ut
must first pass the screening test for top hat employees applied by Enron
Corp. Compensation and then make the deferral election on an approved form.
Also, any such employee must become an employee of Enron Corp. and then
reassigned or seconded to work for Enron Investment Partners.  This
employment requirement is to avoid multiple employer problems related to th=
e
Enron Corp. Deferral Plan and its related trust.

Michelle, it may be "better, faster, simpler" to include a deferral feature
in the LTIP.  The same ERISA issues are present, but Enron Investment
Partners is in control.

Regardless, let=01,s discuss the design for the deferrals at your convenien=
ce.

Ok, you told me nothing, so I am clueless as to what is creating the 
distress.  Maybe we can chat later.

We will not be in Austin in the next few months.  We are going to San Antonio 
the first weekend in March, as well as the first week in April.  The first 
trip is for a wedding between two friends of Trey from Rice MBA who are 
marrying each other.  The other is for the Enron law conference, which is 
Wed.-Friday.  We are not taking Cameron on either of those trips (party 
time!!), so we will be rushing back to Houston right afterwards.

I am working with Butch Hayes at F&J.  I haven't been too involved in the 
matter because it is not an Enron subsidiary, but from what I can tell, I 
like him.  Any additional insight, if necessary, would be great.

Too bad you weren't in Houston a couple of weeks ago.  But, it probably would 
have been a sad time for all of you, and it sounds like you don't really need 
that right now.  If you visit us, we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if 
you need it -- not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me.  Plus, 
Cameron acts like a 2-year-old, which is a delight.  He started at a new 
school a few weeks ago (The Post Oak School -- a Montessori school about a 
block from our house), and he is really coming into his own.  It is amazing 
how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born.  Little things 
like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events (don't even 
get me started on helicopters).  On the other hand, I feel this enormous 
responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world.  
Quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined.  

Enough waxing philosophical.  I've got to get out of here at some point, so 
I'd better get back to work.

Later.  M

Hi Michelle!
Thanks for your message and update.

Yes, January was a tough month, and I guess I got pretty distracted by it all.
Nothing has been resolved but I've gotten over the initial shock and sadness
for my brothers. We were pretty worried about Joe for a while there because
Myra is (was?) the love of his life and he is so vulnerable. I can't remember
how much I told you over the phone (?)

Good to hear from you! We haven't been to Houston in a long time and are due
for a visit. We almost came the weekend of Feb 5-6 because a group was getting
together to go to Jay's gravesite in honor of his Feb 10th birthday. (But work
kept me here that weekend.) Hopefully sometime soon I can get over there and
see you & Trey & Cameron. Any plans to come this way? I'd love to see you.

For V-Day, we went out to eat at the Hula Hut. I picked up my brother Ed from
the airport (he had been in Santa Fe with Joe for a long weekend - we are
taking turns) and Ed came with us for our nice "romantic" dinner. Later Rog
and I went for coffee and dessert as a special treat. We still have a great
time together just talking about stuff and catching up on the day's
happenings.

Hope all is going well with the investigation - it sounded like you were in
good hands with the Fulbright lawyer. (Who is it? - Brian Grieg? Butch Hayes?)
If I can be of any help in any way, please let me know - I would love to work
with you! But, truly, I would  like to just see you again - to catch up and 
have some
laughs! mms

Maria,

I got your voice mail a couple of weeks ago.  It sounded like you were a bit
on
the stressed out side.  I hope things have improved, and that you had a nice,
romantic Valentine's Day yesterday.  Trey and I went to the opera on Sat.
night
for our V-Day event.  We saw the Elixer of Love, which is a very light, cute,
happy-ending opera (no screeching).

I think we got the referrals taken care of on the Austin investigator issue.
Thanks for your input.

Take care, and I'll catch you later.

Michelle

Debbi,

First off, I am wondering how you knew the company name I was calling on.  I
never gave that other girl the name of the company.

Any how, I am wanting information on Contracting Solutions, Inc.  They
listed your company as a reference, and I have been trying to chase this
down for about two months now.  I have been able to contact the other two
references they had given, but the one with your company has been a bear to
run down.

They stated that they have worked with your company on a permanent
placement.  Is this correct?

How was their performance? (did they respond timely with qualified
candidates? With legitimate resumes of real people or were the people no
longer available when you wanted to interview them?, etc.)

Can you tell me if there have been any problems with this company? (if yes,
what are they.)

Are you currently doing business with them?  (If yes, please proceed to the
next question, if no, Please tell me why?)

Do you have any additional information that would assist me in doing
business with this company?

Is there any way you can respond as soon as possible, I would like to either
approve them or close this file.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

We are pursuing an outsourcing opportunity with Puget Sound Energy.   Their 
field employees are represented by IBEW Local 77.  The Business Manager's 
name is David Timothy.

We'd like to put a confidentiality agreement in place with Local 77, so that 
we can share with them our response to Puget's Request for Information.  We 
all seem to recall that an Enron/IBEW agreement was prepared once before, 
either for Anaheim or West Oregon. As is typically the case, we can't seem to 
find a copy!

Can you help out?  If you can't find one, let me know and I'll describe the 
scope we need for local 77.

Thanks

Attached is the resume of Carlos Sole, who currently is working for EECC.  He 
is interested in pursuing opportunities within EWS, and we received excellent 
references about his work performance from John Schwartzenburg and Kay Mann.  
I am meeting with him on Friday of this week (he is out of town until then).  
If you have an interest in talking with him, let me know, and I will arrange 
a meeting.

Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

I have scheduled a meeting for Monday (7/31) at 4:00 at an EB location to be 
determined to finalize the Project Crane Deal Team, and get everyone up to 
speed on the latest developments.

For those of you I have not spoken with, our counterparty has accelerated the 
schedule, and as a result we only have a couple of weeks to assemble a team 
for the data room.  The data room process will begin on Sunday evening, 
August 13 in Quebec City, Quebec, and end Friday, August 18 in Port Angeles, 
Washington, with a travel day in between mills on Wednesday.  My assistant, 
Susie Fallon will handle all the travel arrangements.  We will receive an 
updated itenerary and index of the data room the middle of next week.  I will 
distribute the information memorandum at Monday's meeting.  I apologize for 
the short notice, but look forward to working with you all on this 
transaction.

Thanks,
Patrick

Hoyt,

Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic 
information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages 
in exchange for a release.  We need the title/position and the age of the 
persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as 
well as the persons who were not offered a package.  We will provide this 
data to persons over 40 to validate their releases.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: Project Canary - Asset Purchase Agreement


Michelle, I reviewed the Project Canary Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and
offer the following observations:

In an asset transaction, where the buyer did not want to acquire or assume
the employee benefit plans of the seller, I have always recommended to
include such plans and liabilities in the statement of excluded assets.
Based on the recitals for this transaction, and other provisions of the
Agreement (Sections 7 and 10) it appears that the employee benefit plans are
not excluded.

Generally, when such employee benefit plans are included in an asset
transaction, the buyer wants to obtain representations as to the funding,
compliance and administration of the plans.  These kinds of representations
are not in the Agreement.

The bottom line is that the buyer needs to rely on Canadian counsel and
actuaries to gives buyer the level of comfort it desires to have with respect
to these issues of funding, compliance and administration so that they can be
inserted into the financial model for determining the offering price.

You may wish to obtain a formal opinion letter from the Canadian counsel and
actuary regarding the level of comfort the buyer requires.


Pat

Pat,

Given that the new AESOP has been approved by the comp. committee, do you 
think the language attached below should be revised?  (Or, should I ask -- 
has it been revised?).  If so, would it be possible for you to revise for 
inclusion in offer letters, etc.? 

Thanks a lot!

Michelle

All-Employee Stock Option Program
Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time 
regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through 
the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made 
under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The 
grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or 
a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  A replacement program for beyond 
the year 2000 is under consideration and will likely be reviewed at the May, 
2000 Board meeting.  If approved, this could result in stock option award 
grants to eligible employees.  Program awards are subject to and effective 
upon the approval by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of 
the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock awards shall be made pursuant 
to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as determined by the Committee.  
The exercise price for grants of stock options shall be determined according 
to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which the award is granted.  This 
program may or may not be offered in certain domestic and international 
locations based upon management discretion and/or local labor and employment 
laws.

If you're thinking about the scaft, it probably should be grey or a dark 
plaid.   I am giving him a black overcoat, so grey probably would go the 
best.  (He wouldn't like a contrasting color like red).

He also wants a really nice manicure set -- one that has tweezers.

A few more ideas for my Christmas list:

1.  Scarf:  A nice, not too thick, scarf to wear with an overcoat -- i.e. a
little more formal than the old red plaid
2.  Gloves: Leather, again to use with business attire, black

Brooks Brothers would be a good source for both of the above items, but is
not the only place they might be found.  Polo might be another source.

Michelle,

I have reviewed the document and offer the following items for your 
consideration:

1.  Should we include the standard "affiliate" language for clarity and to 
maximize our flexibility?

2.  Can you tell me the basic differences between the PWD and SSD?

3.  Do we want to impose the Enron Code of Ethics referred to in para. 3a., 
Performance Standards?

4.  I personally believe that we should delete reference to the "Staffing 
Service Fee" in para. 4b and the "Liquidation                Table" in para. 
4c.  These type of fees/factors are subject to many outside influences and 
can fluctuate considerably with the marketplace.  I think that we may lose 
some negotiations leverage by locking any such rates in the basic contract.  
Those kind of issues can still be worked on a case by case basis and 
incorporated into the contract by amendment, or possibly, the PWD.


It looks like an efficient document, and it should save some time and effort 
as we progress.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Tom Moore

		 Subject: Recruiting/Contract Personnel Services Agreement

Attached is a draft of the Agreement for Recruiting or Contract Personnel 
Services.  This draft combines the Master Services Agreement, the Agreement 
for Project Services, and the Staffing Services Agreement into a single, 
comprehensive document.

Attached to this, as applicable, will be a Project Work Description ("PWD") 
and/or a Staffing Services Description ("SSD").  I understand that HR is 
working on a revised PWD.

I will circulate the SSD in the near future.  It will contain a more specific 
description of staffing services (e.g. retained/contingency) as well as pay 
rates.

Please review this draft to determine if it fits your needs.  Feel free to 
throw darts!  Let me know by return email if you have comments or questions.  
I will resolve as many as possible based upon your comments as well as those 
of others in Legal, and circulate a revised draft based upon those comments.

Thank you.

I think that gathering this information at interview makes the most sense.  
Obviously, new hire orientation is too late!  I prefer an original, signed 
document, but a fax is an ok substitute, provided that the applicant mails us 
the originals after faxing.  Thanks.  MHC

Having the candidate fill out the employment application and authorization to 
complete a background check at the time they are interviewed.
Or, told they have to return these two documents along with their signed 
offer letter by mail/fax.

I think faxing would be quicker.  

Some candidates are being told they can complete these forms during new hire 
orientation.

Hope this helps.

John,

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice 
mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of 
issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits 
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for 
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain 
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there 
another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references 
from prior employers, etc.)?  

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that 
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the 
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine 
how to proceed.

Michelle

Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to 
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes 
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment 
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed 
to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our 
use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you 
review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also 
appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with 
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it 
in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

Subject: MG benefits

Dee, we did not find anything that worried us on the benefits side in NYC, 
other than FLSA violations and things like that (which is really a comp 
issue) and I did not hear anything from you regarding things to look at . . . 
.they have just requested a plan amendment to the 401K so that the Rudolph 
Wolff employees can get into the Vanguard 401K immediately rather than 
waiting three months, should you be involved in that (by the way, these are 
our employees now, the folks in London convinced me that we own the company . 
. . . so the benefit plans are our now also)

One issue that keeps coming up is the deferred comp plan for 12 or so 
employees . . . we have to figure out what the value of that plan is and how 
we will keep their benefits substantially similar even though we are not 
going to have a deferred comp plan for them.  And I told the employees that 
we would have some sort of response for them on the 17th when we do the 
"intro to enron" package that is described inthe other email I sent you.  
Would you be able to look at the three benefits packages (Rudolph Wolff, 
MG-USA and Enron) and do a comparison?  also, will you have some time this 
week to talk about any benefits issues?  We really need to get these people 
feeling like they are Enron employees ASAP, they feel neglected now.  Please

Steve,

Here is some proposed language for your memo or e-mail to employees, per
your concerns:
==============
Recently, you may have noticed some activity or heard some rumors regarding
the Ecogas 401(k) plan.  Let me assure you that the plan is sound, and that
the assets of the plan are safely held in trust with Merrill Lynch.  The
activity you may have noticed or the rumors you may have heard likely come
from the fact that Ecogas has been contacted by the Department of Labor for
a routine investigation of the plan.  In connection with that investigation,
Ecogas has hired the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, who has visited our
offices, to conduct a review and to make recommendations for improvement and
for corrective action.  I cannot stress enough that Ecogas stands behind the
401(k) plan and is committed to making the necessary improvements and
corrections.  I know you will join me in welcoming this opportunity to make
our plan better.

Mark,  although I will hate to lose  Carlos and everyone here at EECC and 
NEPCO wants him to stay, in point of fact he has repaid his debt to society 
and is entitled to look at opportunites outside of EECC now. Please feel free 
to talk with him. He is discussing matters with Vicki et al now, and  she is 
aware that he will be contacting ENA (EWS?)as well.  

 As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that 
his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, 
and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity 
and finance related matters (including work-outs).  I do think well of 
Carlos, and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

Hoyt,

If GSP LLC  would assume the liability at the time of return, why would it 
risk bringing them back for light duty work?  Why not wait until they are 
fully released, particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers 
comp scheme?

Also, Hoyt, you need to be careful about revealing conversations with GSP 
counsel to MG -- I noticed you had cc'd someone from Media General in the 
prior email.  We don't want to waive any privileges.

     Peter, we have two long-term worker's comp cases whose accidents
     happened before Enron bought GSP.  We would like to bring them back to
     do light-duty work, to get them in the swing of working again and also
     to get some adminstrative work done.

     I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light
     duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than
     an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and
     employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the
     liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought
     them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE
     HURT HIMSELF AGAIN.  In which case, GSP owns it.

     However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the
     worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement.
     He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return
     to work from worker's comp.  I know that we have an ongoing dispute
     about worker's comp with MG at this point.  What would be your
     recommendation on bringing these employees back to work?

     As a bit of additional info, one of the two employees seems eager to
     come back . . . the other one does not.  An employee told me that the
     second employee actually has a lawsuit filed against MG/old GSP about
     his injury.

representatives in charge with administering the EnronOptions program.

Attached you will find a series of questions regarding the taxation of stock 
options.  I need you to provide answers to the short list of questions and to 
verify those answers already supplied.  You may wish to contact outside tax 
counsel in Mexico to assist you with these questions.  I ask that you

I will make my house available for you do do the first week of laundry this 
weekend.  How about 6:30 am on Saturday?  After that, you can schedule it at 
your convenience for the rest of the 4 weeks.  

I am prepared for you ; I bought Tide, Downey, and Bounce, as well as spray 
starch for all the ironing that needs to be done -- don't worry, I only have 
5-6 full-sized tablecloths and about 15 of Trey's shirts to be ironed.  That

Gerry, Michelle and I rather enjoyed our discussion at lunch time. It was 
highly productive and I would like to thank those who took the time out of 
their very busy schedules to attend.

In no small way related to the high calibre of the people at the meeting and 
the skills of the facilitation, we accomplished a great deal. For ease of 
reference and to make sure you each are clearly on you action before our next 
meeting, here is a summary:

General Minutes
The group voted David, Michele and Gerry as the most intelligent and 
attractive members of the HR community
Gerry had the most interesting strory about disciplining people who are 
always late for meetings by having their houses visited by a radical 
Californian based sect who do the reverse of an exorcism.
The average IQ of those present was measured as over 200 (thanks to Michelle).
Gerry won the tic tack tow tournament 
I won the biggest feet competition

Follow up action points
It was agreed that Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam would do the laundry for 
Michelle for the next 4 weeks.
It was agreed that Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam would clean David and 
Gerry's houses every Tuseday and Thursday for the next month (Gerry is 
concerned about his antique china and has requested that Neil doesn't visit 
his home).
All the wrongs of the world are to be solved and the necessary actions 
implemented by Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam by next Monday at 5pm central 
time (including third world debt and world hunger).

Thanks

David

Subject: RW separations

Michelle,

Please let know what you thing regarding the following:

1) Two of the RW employees have called asking about their Cobra coverage and 
whether or not they are due money for the coverage.  One could argue ( and 
they obviously are ) that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of 
their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation.

If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to 
everyone.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis.

2) Russell Gilardi's attorney has made comment that one could interpret his 
contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the 
year.  Here is the wording verbatim: 

'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the 
Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to 
terminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st 
January 2001.'

I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the 
separation agreements.  For your info, other RW employees with this 
particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out.

3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months 
to 3 months.   He was with MG for a little over a month.  I've asked the SVP 
of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow.   

Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end.!

Cathy

My understanding is that the deal is dead -- stop the presses.  

Thanks for all of your help on this -- I appreciated your efforts and 
explanations.  Perhaps we will work together again in the future.

Michelle,
?
Further to my voicemail, should we advise the actuaries to  cease their due 
diligence work on the Celgar pension plans? They have just  called me to 
advise about some further liabilities under the supplementary plan  for 
non-union employees. Thanks.

Hi Folks:

Enclosed is the agenda for the Corporate HR Leadership Team Meeting that will 
take place tomorrow in the Executive Board Room (50th Floor) from 9:00 to 
10:00. Please note...we will meet in the Board Room not the Dining room on 
the Mezzanine level... Our primary meeting objective will be to review where 
the team stands implementing the short term Action Plans for the Key Focus 
Areas established at the retreat. I understand that some very good work has 
been done and that several potential "Wows" are either currently being 
implemented or about to launch. 

We look forward to getting the latest status reports relative to 
accomplishing these critical activities and keeping the momentum flowing.

Regards, Gerry Gibson

Davie -- 

Meets many, but may have some developmen needs works just fine.  

I just don't want people to say someone is satisfactory and meets 
requirements when, in fact, there are developmental needs that are obvious 
when compared to persons in strong.

So, I am happy with your proposal (although I suggest that your second 
proposal does not meet the "fairly up" goal).

Cheers.  Mich

Mich,

What's middle ground. I would prefer to keep satisfactory wording fairly up. 
This is what caused most concern at mid year in conjunction with our 20% 
guideline for that cluster "We don't feel comfortable putting Joe in here 
given what it says - he really does an OK job".

My orginal pitch was meets many but may have some development needs relative 
to peers, or meets most or exceeds some and sucks in others.

The latter is my personnel favorite.

David

Gina, I am not sure that the "Satisfactory" descriptor is accurate.  "Met" 
expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in 
Satisfactory.  Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would 
be more accurate.

Where are we on the total revamp?  Has that been postponed until next year?

Thanks.  Michelle

Hi Michelle;

I have attached the latest version of the proposed cluster descriptors for 
year end-2000.  We would like to have these reviewed by the VP/MD PRC 
Committee tomorrow , but wanted to ensure that you saw them first.  They 
comprise merely a refinement of the present descriptors, with an effort to 
demonstrating "relativity".  let me know your thoughts, thanks, G

Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I 
ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that 
the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon 
we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be 
replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.

Thanks.

Thanks for the description.  Last night, I asked Trey about it, and we went

enjoy.  FYI:  the price at Amazon was way less than the price at etoys.  As a 
matter of fact, I told Trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to

Congrats on the furniture.  I am sure that you will be happy with it and will

Leap pad looks like an open book when placed in a child's lap.  There is an
attached pen type instrument which the child can use to point to various
things on the pages and also to indicate whether he/she would like the word
to be pronounced, spelled or sounded.  It comes with a book but other books
can be purchased to be placed in the pad.  That's the best description I can
give since I have never used one.  Check it out when you go to the toy
store.  Good news - several pieces of our living/dining  room furniture are
being delivered tomorrow with all new coordinated materials!  Happy art

purposes.  Particular attention needs to be paid to the area that addresses 
employees on leave of absence.  The excel document includes 3 worksheets 
which are the attachments to the Write-Up.

Amy,

Is Patrick Chris Mallory located in Portland or in California?  If 
California, then he needs a slightly different agreement because non-competes 
are not enforceable in California.  

Let me know.  (I hope he is in Oregon!)

Thanks. 

Michelle

Dee, Jeff, Rick -

I need to set up a meeting between the benefit group and the tax people to 
walk through the structure we want for the purchase of Project Crane.  We 
made a good bit of progress in Toronto over Thursday and Friday on the tax 
structure, but clearly indicated the need to confirm all of this in relation 
to benefit issues.  I would like to have the meeting on Monday sometime, but 
need to coordinate schedules.  As soon as possible, please advise me of your 
respective availabilities so that a meeting can be scheduled, keeping in mind 
the need to have Rick involved.

Thanks.

Elspeth, do we want to do a new agreement, or simply assume the obligations 
in the old one?  If the former, I'd do a new agreement.  If the latter, I 
believe I simply can do an assignment agreement, once I receive a copy of the 
current agreement.  It also depends on the language in the old one, and 
whether we believe it protects ENA.  So, we'd have to look at it.

Sharon, do you have the file on this person?  If so, let me know, and I will 
have someone come and pick it up.  Thanks.

Michelle

Subject: Project Crane (Daishowa)

I have scheduled a meeting for Monday (7/31) at 4:00 at an EB location to be 
determined to finalize the Project Crane Deal Team, and get everyone up to 
speed on the latest developments.

For those of you I have not spoken with, our counterparty has accelerated the 
schedule, and as a result we only have a couple of weeks to assemble a team 
for the data room.  The data room process will begin on Sunday evening, 
August 13 in Quebec City, Quebec, and end Friday, August 18 in Port Angeles, 
Washington, with a travel day in between mills on Wednesday.  My assistant, 
Susie Fallon will handle all the travel arrangements.  We will receive an 
updated itenerary and index of the data room the middle of next week.  I will 
distribute the information memorandum at Monday's meeting.  I apologize for 
the short notice, but look forward to working with you all on this 
transaction.

Thanks,
Patrick

Attached is a draft of the Agreement for Recruiting or Contract Personnel 
Services.  This draft combines the Master Services Agreement, the Agreement 
for Project Services, and the Staffing Services Agreement into a single, 
comprehensive document.

Attached to this, as applicable, will be a Project Work Description ("PWD") 
and/or a Staffing Services Description ("SSD").  I understand that HR is 
working on a revised PWD.

I will circulate the SSD in the near future.  It will contain a more specific 
description of staffing services (e.g. retained/contingency) as well as pay 
rates.

Please review this draft to determine if it fits your needs.  Feel free to 
throw darts!  Let me know by return email if you have comments or questions.  
I will resolve as many as possible based upon your comments as well as those 
of others in Legal, and circulate a revised draft based upon those comments.

Thank you.

David,

I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we 
are not dealing with Bidder D.

I think it is ok legally to go this way -- although there is potential 
liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).  We probably can 
schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be 
affected 60 days' notice. 

Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.  I'd prefer it 
if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be 
able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and 
present for possible hiring by the buyer.  

I would like more information about what is meant by "ENA does not interfere 
with" the offers made by the buyer.  Does that mean no counteroffers? 

To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that 
it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.  It is easier to commit only the 
wholesale group, rather than ask Corp., EES, Broadband, etc.  whether they 
will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group, 
if possible.  We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have 
been involved in this transaction.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

Subject: Triple Lutz Employee Matters

With respect to bidder D we are being asked not to compete with them for 
those employees they would like to hire.  i.e. we have to sever them and 
bidder D gets to hire them if they want to (in which case the severed 
employees get no severance payment if they turn DFS down).  I would like to 
propose something like the following:

 1.  We provide Bidder D with a list of all Designated Employees, their 
position, historical compensation.
 2.  Bidder D covenants to make offers to ___% of certain pools of Designated 
Employees e.g. commercial, operations, engineering, trading, etc.
 3.  Bidder D covenants to make offers that will not allow Designated 
Employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance 
plan.
 4.  Between signing and closing, Bidder D provide us with a list of Offerees 
- Designated Employees to whom Bidder D intends to make offers of    
employment.
 5.  ENA covenants that we will not interfere with Bidder D's offers (can we 
bind all of Enron?).
 6.  If an Offeree turns down the offer (in writing) then ENA is free to 
continue to employee Offeree.  However, if we do not continue to employ the 
Offeree, no   severance is owed.
 
The intent of the above is to encourage Offerees to take the offers - they 
give up severance rights if they don't - but provide us the opportunity to 
continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we 
want to keep.  Also it caps our severance obligation by requiring Bidder D to 
specify how many offers must be made.  Bidder D is certain to want more than 
this but I am uncomfortable saying we can't continue to employee any of the 
Offerees.

Please advise.

Littler, Mendelson.  I hope that helps. Michelle

I have a friend that is a 5th year lawyer who has 4 years of labor and 
employment experience with a large law firm and a labor boutique firm (both 
here in town)- this person has asked me if Enron might have a need for a 
labor and employment lawyer with these kind of credentials.  Would you pretty 
please ask your wife if she is aware of any potential opportunities.  

Thanks - Tara

Ann, I am following up on the status of the research involving Section 6.4 of 
the SPA; specifically, what are the potential liabilities of Enron selecting 
persons for termination and providing those names to the Seller?  I would 
like to have this research asap because our time table is very short.  Do you 
have any information on that?  Thanks.  Michelle Cash

Subject: Fwd: GSP Benefits Required Action List


Mr. del Vecchio and Ms. Cash,

We are following up regarding the outstanding benefits issues in the GSP 
purchase.  It is very important that certain benefits matters be addressed 
and resolved before the Closing Date.

Attached is a copy of our Benefits Required Action list, which was sent to 
Dolores Lenfest, Mark Greenberg, and Mr. del Vecchio on July 21, 2000.  We 
spoke with Stuart Zisman today, who suggested we make sure that both of you 
have receive a recent copy of the list.  (Please let us know if you have any 
problems opening the WordPerfect document.  The page set-up to print should 
be 'landscape'.)

Among the outstanding issues is the amount of potential withdrawal liability 
existing in the 2 multiemployer pension plans.   These numbers should be 
requested from the multiemployer plans as soon as possible.  A concern has 
been raised as to whether requesting such information from the multiemployer 
plans will create problems with the union or plan because the union or plan 
might be given the false impression that GSP anticipates terminating these 
benefits.  We do not expect any such problems (especially if the plan is told 
that the sale is anticipated and the buyer wants to make sure of its 
potential liabilities).  A request for withdrawal liability, although not a 
daily event, is something that falls within the ordinary administration of a 
plan.   The plans should either have this amount immediately available, or be 
able to calculate this amount for you.  If you would like us to assist you 
with obtaining this information, please let us know.

We have included Dolores Lenfest as the responsible person for the majority 
of the required actions, since she had been our main contact.  If any of 
these actions have been assigned to another responsible party, please let us 
know.

Thank you.
Ann Murray

Following your review of the attached e-mail traffic, please provide us

this nature may be perceived in the Japanese market.

John,

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your
voice mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because
of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is
there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g.,
references from prior employers, etc.)?

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine
how to proceed.

Michelle

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have
agreed to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as
to our use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can
you review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would
also appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from
it in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

Hoyt,

I have reviewed the attached.  I think it looks good.  It strikes the balance 
of welcoming and also letting them know that changes will occur in the 
future.  Kriste, any other thoughts?

I tried to make this as innocuous as I could, it will not make the New York

Scott, 

I would love to attend, except that I will be out of the office on vacation 
that whole week.  It sounds like a great presentation!  

Would you mind if I forward it to some other folks in corporate legal who 
might be interested (i.e., my counterparts)?  

Thanks.  Michelle

Subject: Economic Espionage Act Presentation - August 15th


You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled:  "Acquiring 
Information: Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA)".   Daniel 
Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and 
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.  
Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate 
America collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to 
explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include 
"hypothetical" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) 
to illustrate his points.

This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls 
(CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's 
Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of 
issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of 
competitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to 
raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate 
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well 
as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I 
believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find 
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.  

The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor 
Conference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.



 
P.S.  By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will 
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the "Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA)," and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

Attached is my preliminary report based on the information in the data room.

There was not near enough information in the data room, and for the second
time, there was no one from the Seller present at the data room who we could
ask questions of.

There are a couple of areas of concern.  There is still a lot of data to be
furnished.  Much of the documents in the data room was not allowed to be
copied.

I have instructed Paul Blundy, the  attorney contact for our Canadian counsel
to have documents sent to Rick.

Rick, as you receive data that involves benefits, please send it to Dee.

I provided a copy of our Q format to Roland, our Canadian labor counsel, to
format and revise as need to fit the Canadian companies being acquired.  He
seemed to be knowledgeable in labor relations, but will need actuarial help
(as will we) in reviewing the benefit accruals for defined benefit plans.

For the next two weeks, I will have my beeper and will check my phone
messages as I find telephones in the wilderness.

I also provided a hard copy of the attachment to the Enron deal guys before I
left Toronto.

Sharon, Kristi, & Michelle,
I am currently involved in a task group that is reviewing processes for the 
Transaction Processing Center, SAP go live on 7/1.  The processes involve all 
aspects from hiring, transfers, position control and termination.  I wanted 
to drop a line to check with you to see if there were any current reviews 
that your group might be conducting at this time that would require updates 
or changes to the current state processing.  We want to be sure to capture 
all gaps (i.e.  specific terminology, forms, letters, contracts, etc.) are 
documented and resolved before go live.

We would greatly appreciate any feedback you could provide at this time.  
Also, if you are aware of any other groups that might need to be contacted 
that have a vested interest, we will gladly give them a call.

Thanks so much,
Sylvia

Peter,

I learned yesterday for the first time about Project Canary, which involves 
the purchase of an asset that employs 400 employees and also has a unionized 
workforce.  I understand that we are in the second round, and that there is a 
deadline of 12/15.

Peter, we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me 
involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues.  
You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there 
are employees and unions from my clients in HR.  That makes me and the legal 
department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service 
for Enron.

Please provide me with information about this deal asap.  And, I repeat my 
request to get me involved earlier on future deals.

Thank you.

Michelle

Michelle,

The new program still needs final approval by the Enron Corp. board of
directors.  The design was tentatively approved last month, subject to final
review.  The following revised provision should serve you well in the
meantime:



All-Employee Stock Option Program

Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time
regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through
the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made
under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The
grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or
a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  Subject to final approval by the
Enron Corp. board of directors, a one time award of non-qualified stock
options under a replacement program is proposed to be made to eligible
employees as of December 29, 2000, in value equal to 25% of annual base
salary (5% of annual base salary for a 5-year period; salary valuation and
value may vary in some international locations).  Program awards are subject
to and effective upon the approval by the Compensation and Management
Development Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock
awards will be made pursuant to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as
determined by the Committee.  The exercise price for grants of stock options
will be determined according to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which
the award is granted.  The program may or may not be offered in certain
domestic and international locations based upon management discretion and/or
local labor and employment laws.

Bret,

I received the schedule and itinerary for diligence on Project Crane and have 
forwarded it to Rick Johnson, Fran Mayes, Pat Mackin, and Dee Lenfest.

We have preliminarily decided that Rick Johnson will go to both sites to 
cover Labor (union) issues and support in the general HR diligence that Fran 
Mayes of ENA HR will conduct.  Either Pat or Dee will travel to Washington to 
address benefits issues, including obtaining information for subsequent 
modeling of benefit costs.  We would like to have our outside counsel in 
Canada conduct the benefits diligence in the Quebec City location and to 
support Rick to the extent that there may be any special issues of Canadian 
or Quebec law.   I will continue to coordinate these activities and provide 
whatever other assistance may be needed.

Let me know if you need any other information about this diligence plan for 
employment/labor matters.  I will work with Peter Del Vecchio to identify our 
outside counsel designee.

 Michelle

Wednesday will be a travel day, and we will spend Thursday and Friday at the

Please continue to work on your due diligence lists, and we will call you 
early next week to finalize responsibilities.  

Thanks

Can I do this myself? I used to just run with the draft that you/Twanda sent 
and removed the confidential header. Can I no longer do this? I would like to 
get this to Mark today so please let me know.

Tara,

We can make the salary retroactive as part of the contract.  Have we already 
sent you executables?  If so, we can re-run with a provision that states, 
"Effective 3/1/00, Employee's Monthly Base Salary shall be $xxxx."  The 
effective date still can be 6/1.

Twanda, would you please make that change and run executables?

Thanks.

Michelle/Twanda

On the nomination form for Mark Schroeder's agreement, it requests to 
backdate the salary to March 1st, even though the effective date of the 
agreement is not until June 1st. Can this be incorporated into the agreement 
or do we need to do a side letter to Mark?

Thanks

Jane, this issue continues to be 'worked' here at Enron.  In relation to a 
current initiative which includes a new employee directory, we are working 
with the business unit leaders (Cindy Olson, Steve Kean, Mark Palmer, Vision 
and Values Task Force) and Sharon Butcher, Kelly Higgason, and Brian 
Schaffer.  Michelle Cash and Sharon have been involved in several discussions 
relating to our global data collection efforts through HR-GIS.  We have a 
meeting scheduled next week and I will ask Sharon to include the information 
below in the discussion.  

In general, I understood Sharon and Kelly to indicated that research has been 
done for some locations and may have to be continuously updated.  Other Enron 
locations have not been researched and will have to be prioritized and 
evaluated for research, i.e., it was recommended that we focus our efforts on 
locations with the higher employee populations.

Subject: EU-US "Safe Harbor" agreement

Jane:

I participated in a lunch yesterday on Capitol Hill which discussed the 
recently concluded bilateral negotiations between Europe and the US on the 
issue of data privacy/safe harbor.  I admit that I don't fully understand the 
issue, but in essence I'm told it's an internal EU directive passed a few 
years ago (not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet, by 
the way) that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of 
the privacy of transmitted data (eg, over the internet).   The EU wants to 
forbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don't "adequately 
protect" the information.  As always, the EU wants to regulate the issue, 
while the US prefers self-regulation.  After two years of negotations, they 
agreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be 
put in "safe harbors", which are basically approved bodies that would check 
the recipient's ability to protect the privacy of the information, ie, an 
American company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or 
offices.  

How does this affect Enron?  A couple of other company reps said it is 
especially pertinent to HR issues, such as transmitting personnel 
information, salary, etc. from Europe back to the home office in the US.

Given our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe, does this affect 
us, and do you want us to track down more information?

Regards,
Steve Burns

strategies and basis for setting it up that way would be.  If you don't mind

Drew,

At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among 
Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.  I think 
that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we 
begin to move towards shared services across the organization.

Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or 
revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we 
really need to put some in place).

Thanks.

I am sending you links to our newest ASAP's on California wage and hour and
workers compensation issues.  Our ASAP's are our summary of important
developments in employment law.  If you do not have employees in California,
these ASAP's probably are not relevant to your company.

The first ASAP summarizes recent developments relating to whether or not
computer professionals and nurses must be paid overtime.  The link to this
ASAP follows:

http://128.241.163.162/nwsltr/asap_sb88.html

The second ASAP is a general overview of the current state of the workers'
compensation system in California.  This may even be of interest if you do
not have employees in California because the issues that arise in California
often occur in other parts of the country.  The link to this ASAP follows:

http://128.241.163.162/nwsltr/asap_insurance.html

Please notify me if you have problems opening this link.  I can send you a
hard copy of the ASAP if necessary. In addition, feel free to print or
forward this link to others in your or other companies, or use it in any
other manner that assists your organization. In addition, let me know if you

Thanks, Sharon.  The GIS version just adds a view words from the employment 
application alerting employees not to 'overstate' their education, skills, 
experience, etc.

Dear Sherry:  I provided the SAP version which is similar to the one on the 
Corporate LAN.  I will have Mark Holsworth and Kriste Sullivan provide their 
comments.  Thanks.   Sharon

Subject: HR On-Line Logon Screen

We are working on a single logon process through HR On-Line that will enable 
employees to utilize functionality in SAP Employee Self Service and HR-GIS 
without having to be concerned about which system to use.  I am attaching the 
security warning messages from both systems for your review.  Andrea and I 
believe it would be best to combine these statements and would appreciate 
your assistance in doing so.  Michelle, as you will recall, you helped us 
with the statement for HR-GIS.  I do not know who provided the SAP version, 
but it seems more similar to the general one on the Corporate LAN.

Please let me know if one of you can assist us with this.  We are under a 
pretty tight time crunch with July 1 looming fairly closely.  Thank you for 
your consideration and help!

Subject: October 26 Corporate HR Leadership Team Meeting

Hi Folks:

Enclosed is the agenda for the Corporate HR Leadership Team Meeting that will 
take place tomorrow in the Executive Board Room (50th Floor) from 9:00 to 
10:00. Please note...we will meet in the Board Room not the Dining room on 
the Mezzanine level... Our primary meeting objective will be to review where 
the team stands implementing the short term Action Plans for the Key Focus 
Areas established at the retreat. I understand that some very good work has 
been done and that several potential "Wows" are either currently being 
implemented or about to launch. 

We look forward to getting the latest status reports relative to 
accomplishing these critical activities and keeping the momentum flowing.

Regards, Gerry Gibson

     Michelle:  You have 6 seats for the Orioles-White Sox game on Monday
evening, August 14.  These are the "firm seats" that I mentioned -- along
the third baseline above the visitor's dugout.  Game time is 7:35 p.m.  I'll
send the tickets down to you in the next day or two.  Have fun!

Do you have a Consulting Services agreement or a Professional Services

Mr. Del Vecchio,
?
We have received materials concerning the pension plan for non-union  
employees at Celgar. The company's latest actuarial report disclosed that as 
of  January 1, 2000:
?
1. The going-concern liabilities exceeded the actuarial value of assets  by? 
C$1,922,342; and
?
2.? The solvency liabilities exceeds the market value of plan assets  by? 
C$1,805,819.
?
We have also received the full text of the plan and its amendments.
?
Will you be reviewing these matters internally or shall we retain a local  
actuarial firm to perform the due diligence?

Pat,

I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement 
for Greg Whalley.  I would appreciate your thoughts on the language, 
particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation 
of value for options/restricted stock.  

For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my 
assistant send it under separate email cover.

Thanks a lot.

Michelle

Yes the two are the new policy and agreement; the "annotated" has not been
revised, but explains the point about Exhibit C to the Agreement.

Wow. You should have received these awhile ago. We had a virus shutdown,
but
I cannot think of any other reason why you do not have these. Let me state
what I attempted to state in my last message:

     1) As to the Data Protection Agreements, we contemplate that an
Exhibit C will be attached that will describe the non-exclusive types of
information that will be personal data. For your information I am resending
the "annotated" version of this agreement to describe the significance of
the removal of brackets. We also added a section 3.g to allow additions to
the purposes for collection. As the regulators in the EU become more
refined
in their analysis and requirements as to the statement of purpose, you
might
need to alter purposes.

     2) As to the Policy itself, we inserted a line that dates the
revision of the policy, and we added a provision in Section 2 corresponding
to the change in Section 3.g mentioned above.

Please call me to let me know that you got this. Should I send something to
John?!

Our ASAP's are our summaries of important developments in employment law.
If you do not have employees in California, this ASAP probably is not

that expands the definition of disability beyond federal law and creates a
new cause of action against employers for failing to engage in the
reasonable accommodation interactive process.

Hi Michelle, we've finished our due diligence on John Guerriero from Duke.  I 
didn't speak to his references but Paul DeVries did and he and Rob Milnthorp 
are both satisfied that there were no earlier occurrences of the legal 
situation that is unfolding now (or other signs of incompetence or lack of 
judgement).  John is being courted by several companies right now and they 
want to get an offer to him today.  Just wanted to let you know where we were 
on this one....

Mary,

Hope things are going well with you and yours! Nigel and I were discussing 
some contract language today and wanted some input from you on how we might 
word future grants of options or stock. Should we be wording Director Level 
and below agreements with a more generic "equity" component instead of 
specifying options or restricted stock? My question revolves around our 
tendency from time to time to change the structure of how we deliver value as 
a company. Your thoughts? What are others doing?

Michelle 

Again, not sure about these new procedures! 

The signing authority at the back of Mark's agreement says David Oxley. We 
have always had a member of Office of the Chair in London sign these, ie 
Frevert, Sherriff and I was hoping Mark Frevert's signature would do in this 
case as well.

Please confirm, thanks
Tara

Michelle:
 I got the answer to the voicemail message I left for you about which lawyer 
would be the contact for the Enron Europe countries for the new Enron 
employee stock option plan.  Jon Chapman will be responsible for Norway, 
Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey (and any other Enron Europe countries that 
are added between now and December).  I assume you are the appropriate lawyer 
for Mexico.  (If not, please forward this message to the right lawyer, and cc 
me so that I know who it is!)  Please read the message below for an 
explanation of the first action item (due June 23rd).  The Mexico spreadsheet 
is contained in the file marked "CALME AESOP" at the  end of Jana's message.  
Thanks for your help!

Jonathon:
 I was in a meeting this morning concerning the new Enron employee stock 
option plan that will be implemented at the end of this year, and Melissa 
Laing (who participated by telephone) informed me that you were the lawyer to 
support Enron Europe HR on this project.  I recently joined the Enron Corp. 
legal staff from Enron International legal.  My role in this project is to 
coordinate the international legal support for the new option plan.  As such, 
I have contacted lawyers in various international business units to work with 
local counsel in each of the countries in which Enron has employees who will 
participate in the plan, to ensure that the plan does not run afoul of any 
legal restrictions.  Based on current information (which is likely to change 
between now and December, per Melissa Laing), the relevant countries in the 
Enron Europe group are Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.  In the 
attachment labeled "asiapac" at the end of Jana Domke's message, you will 
find spreadsheets for all five of the Enron Europe companies.  Please review 
(with local counsel, if necessary) the information in the "Legal Compliance" 
section of each spreadsheet to confirm that the information therein is 
accurate.  Please forward any changes or comments to me and Jana Domke (Jana 
has requested that the review be complete by June 23rd).  The Public 
Relations department is currently preparing the written material that will 
communicate the details of the plan to the participating employees.  When 
that is available, I will send it to you so that you may make any 
modifications that are necessary to comply with local laws in each of the 
Enron Europe countries.  The communication documents will be available in 
English, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Greek.  Please call me at 
713-853-5698 with any questions.  Thank you for your assistance!

		 Subject: AESOP 2000 - Country Summaries

If you attended the recent AESOP meeting, you are aware that the approval for 
establishing an Enron AESOP 2000 Program was granted by the Executive 
Committee on April 6, 2000.  In most instances, the plan design replicates 
the prior Plan parameters.  However, on an international basis, there have 
been numerous regulatory and legislative changes which may impact this 
program.

Attached are individual Country Summary Highlights which consolidate the 
various accounting/tax/legal/banking/human resource, etc. details and issues 
into one document.  This consolidated document is based not only on 
information gleaned from the previous AESOP inplementation, but it also 
reflects the most recent local tax changes - at least based upon the 
information we have here.

Because successful Plan implementation and rollout is predicated upon solid 
information, understanding and interpretation, we need your assistance.  
Please coordinate review of the your appropriate country documents with your 
local financial, legal, tax and/or other professionals, as required.  We want 
to ensure that AESOP incents our employees and reinforces the "One ENRON" 
philosophy - but at the same time, we need to ensure this program is cost 
effective, tax efficient, legally defensible and culturally acceptable in 
your areas of responsibility. 

Please document any specific issues and/or concerns, and where appropriate, 
provide input on viable options, corrective action, etc.. Also, if you have 
plans to be in other foreign locations prior to AESOP implementation and they 
need to be included, please advise ASAP.  Please send your responses via 
e-mail to either Dung Huynh or myself or by fax to (713) 646-7203.  If you 
have questions or if you need to discuss further, please call me @ (713) 
345-6142.  Our timeline is tight so would appreciate your responses at the 
latest by June 23rd - earlier if possible.  

Once we have the input, we'll roll this information up into a revised Summary 
Document, identifying issues that need further assessment/discussion and move 
forward to coordiinate final resolution with the AESOP team members.


Appreciate your assistance!

Regards/Jana Domke & Dung Huynh


PS - I apologize ahead of time for not getting all the countries correctly 
sorted by region.  You may need to extrapolate your specific locations from 
one or more of the following attachments.

Hello everyone!!

Well, no one is celebrating anything specific, so we haven't had an 
opportunity
for the girls to get together in a while.  Therefore, we have decided to have 
a
NO Excuses Girls Night.

The proposed date is Friday, Sept. 29 -- Are there any major conflicts with 
this
date?

Proposed place is to be determined.  Debbie Rank suggested that a restaurant
would be the easiest.  I offered to have it at my house, but she was concerned
that I would get stuck doing too much and spending too much.  My thought is 
that
if everyone agrees to chip in a bit, we can have it catered, and no one will

Pat,

Thanks for your comments on the agreement.  As an FYI, the stock awards 
already have been made, so we had to soften the language in the agreement to 
address that situation.

I appreciate your other thoughts.  

Mary, could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an 
example as suggested by Pat?

Thanks.

with you.  Please advise.

Thanks.

Subject: Special Background letter

Michelle - 

I have drafted up a special letter to send to the candidate with the 
derogatory results on his background investigation report.  We had decided 
not to engage him for business reasons unrelated to the background report 
(his job requisition was actually cancelled), and you suggested that we send 
him a copy of his report anyway.

Could you look over this letter and let me know if it is suitable to send 
out?  Will we need to also modify the second letter (that contains contact 
information for the investigation agency) and send it out in a couple of 
weeks, or will this one letter be sufficient?  Or should I incorporate the 
contact information into this letter?

Thanks for your assistance.

I would characterise my view as "treat the causes not the symptoms".  
Bottomline line, change and innovation are good.  Let's capture the good 
available to us in innovation.

With respect to free radicals, something is missing which creates 
instability, negativity and a highly reactive state.  For this reason, free 
radicals are very "short-lived."   Let's avoid short-lived results.

HR folks, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, etc.:

I too would like to be involved in this discussion.  I would comment that I 
support any type of broad band structure vs. a "Hay type" system.  Having 
been part of organizations having various types of both, payment, movement 
and placement of people is simply, much easier with broad banding in a 
relatively flat organization.

OK. Great. 

However, in our laudable desire to be practical and enter this debate 
understanding some of the undisputed challenges a radical approach might 
present, LETS NOT KILL RADICAL THOUGHT OR IDEAS PLEASE! At least initially 
lets get all the opinions out there before we place any limits or timeframes 
or qualifications.

David:

Would love to be involved in this as a view of process and change 
opportunity.  

We do not want to react to, and treat, the symptoms (number of absolute 
categories), without full consideration of the root cause and setting a plan 
to address it.  The real change issue as I see it is job description and 
"position" classification.   The real project is to rationalise the job 
structures within Enron - simplify wherever possible.  Target a cut from 24 
categories to say 12.  This impacts not only the PRC, but how we look at 
compensation across the levels, function performed (e.g., commercial, 
commercial support, technical) and specialization areas (e.g.,  legal, 
accounting, IT, engineering, HR, etc.)

With respect to current yearend PRC, it is hard to change the agreed process 
midstream.  It is doable if we can show where/how certain of the categories 
are "equivalent" and should be considered together.   Only caveat is to 
ensure we do not render the root cause untreatable by addressing symptoms.


Tim / Gerry:

How would you like to approach this?  Two key groups we need to link in are 
Compensation (Mary Joyce, Pam Butler) and PRC (Gina Corteselli, Andrea 
Yowman).  Let talk early next week.

Bob

Commie and Capitalist 

It seems to me that both ideas and philosophies have merits - it is all down 
to how you assign value to roles - in ENA commercial deal making function 
this is very easy to do - how much they profit they generate - grade has very 
little place in this world.

In other areas it is harder and grading provides a methodology (far from 
perfect) for grouping and providing structure around a set of skills and how 
they are valued in the organisation. To lose them without providing some 
other method of measuring value e.g. a more robust PRC process, would run the 
risk of making a sometimes too subjective process even more subjective.

Give me a small number of loose grades anytime. So we should aim for nearer 
to 8/9 and head away from the 24 - having 7 levels for admins does smack of 
bureacracy.

Would be interested to be involved in looking at this

David,

Obviously I missed this meeting, but Scott has been good enough to fill in 
some of the details for me. In concept I agree that less levels is better, 
but I am not sure that we can get it down to 5. The process does warrant 
further discussion and I would like to be included.

I'm disappointed that we haven't followed up on the conversation we had a few 
weeks ago relating to the 24 hierarchical levels we apparently preside over 
here at Enron.

My view remains we should have a strong ambition to significantly reduce and 
simplify the current grade structures. Far from adding additional levels a 
fundamental analysis should be made of the need for any more than 5 from top 
to bottom. In this regard I would lay down the following challenge for your 
comments: why would the following structure not work better in promoting a 
flat, entrepreneurial, open, fast paced organisation, while also 
significantly reducing the bureaucracy:

Number of PRC levels Commercial   Support/Technical   Key
1    MD/VP    Same     Collapse 2
2    Deal Makers    Management    Collapse 3
3    A&A's    Specialists/Consultants/Professionals Collapse 3/5
4    Admin (non- Exempt)  Same     Collapse 7!

Dorie,

I think this looks good.  I have two tweaks:

On the "Let me be clear" sentence, I'd delete the "let me be clear" 
introduction.  I think the last sentence speaks for itself.  
In the last sentence, why not conclude by saying that if they don't pay, "we 
will have no choice but to take further action on this matter" and delete the 
reference to attorneys.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Otherwise, it is good to go.

Good luck!

Michelle

Hi. Some interesting reading. Although it doesn't explicitly relate to 
foreign assignments, I am aware that our assignments to and from Europe are 
predominately white males and I am assuming that this is the case globally as 
well.  I am sure that if Enron was ever filed with a lawsuit for 
discrimination, this could be an area that would negatively affect the 
outcome of Enron's defence as foreign assignments generally provide career 
development opportunities that most non-white males at Enron are missing out 
on.

Thought I'd share this with the group.  This case will be watched very 
closely because 1) it was filed against Microsoft, and 2) because of the 
large potential class of plaintiffs.  Class action suits are an employers 
worst nightmare (think Texaco and Coca-Cola). 

Please feel free to share this with your management.

Discrimination Suit 
Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee
Alleges Discrimination Based on Race, Sex 



SEATTLE--A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp. alleging the company 
maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African 
American and female salaried employees, affecting pay rates and promotion 
opportunities (Donaldson v. Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, 
10/4/00). 
Such discrimination at the company "is the standard operating procedure," the 
lawsuit said. 

The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job 
benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 
400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. 

Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate 
discrimination of any kind. 

"We take these kinds of issues very seriously," Murray said regarding the 
lawsuit. The company has an "active diversity policy" and seeks to recruit 
and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could 
not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. 

The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who 
worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former 
African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 
4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint 
said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 
percent are women. 

Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 
21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft 
employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. 

The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The 
named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of 
all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female 
salaried employees at Microsoft. 

"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely 
subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting 
the terms and conditions of their employment" at the company, the complaint 
said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil 
Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are "systemic in nature, 
and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's 
operations," the lawsuit maintains. 


'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged

The complaint said the company allows "excessive subjectivity" in decisions 
involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against 
employees in the class who complained "either internally or externally about 
Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving 
unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating 
them."
 
The lawsuit said the company "uses an excessively subjective evaluation 
system" that allows managers "who are predominantly white males, to rate 
employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit." 
Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of 
five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the 
company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each 
score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. 

"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a 
certain number of them must still receive the lower scores." Any employee 
with a 2.5 score is placed on a "personal improvement plan" or asked to 
resign, the complaint said. 

"Stack rankings" are used to rank employees in the same job category and 
organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be 
ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically 
higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. 

"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal 
popularity with other managers" because the rankings mix employees working 
for different managers. 

In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company 
also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries 
"substantially lower" than those paid white males doing similar work, with 
the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit 
said. 

Furthermore, "excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria" are applied in 
promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African 
Americans and female employees.

Brian, 

Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you.   I think he has a good 
idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.  Currently, it is done on 
an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation.  

Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?  It would 
be an excellent start.

Thanks.

Michelle

Dianne,

Thanks for all your work for the Travel Club.  I never make a meeting, but 
really enjoy the tickets, etc.

One question I have is whether Enron has any special relationships with 
Disney.  Are we a corporate client of Disney?  My old law firm had some sort 
of relationship with Disney that let us get great deals, early entry into the 
parks, etc., so it may be worth looking into.

Thanks again.

Subject: ETC - Election of Officers 2001



We will have election of officers at our regularly scheduled meeting on 
Tuesday, December 12, 2000.

The present slate of officers listed below have volunteered to continue to 
serve for the upcoming year.  

Dianne Langeland -- President
Nancy Callans -- Vice President/Historian/Parliamentarian
Donna Teal -- Secretary
Margaret Doucette -- Treasurer
Mary Nguyen -- Assistant Treasurer
Paul Carroll -- Webmaster

We feel we have become a good working team and would appreciate your support 
in our candidacy for 2001.  We discussed this at our last monthly meeting and 
there was no strong objection to this suggestion.  Therefore, unless there is 
strong objection from the membership at large, this slate officers will stand 
and there will be no need to make other nominations for these positions. 

However, there is one position open that we need to fill and we are 
soliciting nominations for this position.  

Membership Secretary  -- The Membership Secretary shall act on behalf of the 
Secretary in the Secretary's absence, assist the Secretary in the fulfillment 
of the duties of the Secretary such as preparing the agenda for monthly 
meetings and taking of minutes at the monthly meetings.  It is imperative 
that the person filling this position be able to attend each monthly meeting 
which is held on the second Tuesday of each month.

Therefore, if you have someone that you would like to nominate for this 
position, please forward the name to me.  I will contact the nominee(s) to 
see if he/she is willing to serve, notify the membership of the nominee(s)  
and we will decide next Tuesday.

We, also, will be recognizing all the coordinators of events and officers for 
their untiring efforts during the past year.  Coordinators are the heartbeat 
of our Club and the officers are the backbone of the Club.  They are the ones 
who take the initiative to pursue the Club's activities and the tenacity to 
follow through to see that our members have a wide variety of events in which 
to participate.    

I would like to take this opportunity to solicit any suggestions, thoughts, 
etc. that you might have regarding the Enron Travel Club, its events, its 
officers, its members, etc.   It is the goal of all the officers to make this 
Club the best it can be.  It is only through active participation of its 
members that will ensure its success.  Your comments,  regardless of the 
content, are important to enable us to continue to improve the Club and its 
activities.  

I look forward to seeing you all at the next meeting.

Thanks,

Dianne

Enron North America had some summer clerks this summer.   Generally, we do 
not hire lawyers without significant legal experience (i.e., more than 6 
years) unless they have some extraordinary skills and abilities (e.g., 
someone with lots of Enron experience).

I hope that helps. 

Michelle

Felicia,

This is a merchant asset, which we currently own 100%, but plan to sell down 
in the coming months.  It absolutely has separate HR functions from Enron -- 
they do not participate in Enron benefits, and we are working hard to prevent 
any claims that we could be a joint employer with it.  

Thoughts?

Michelle,  who is GSP?  Are they a legal entity?  Are they on our payroll?  
If they are we filed EEO-1's for them.    Below is the criteria to file an 
EEO-1 report:

Standard Form 100 must be filed by -

A.  All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 
1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments, 
primary and secondary school systems, institutions of higher education, 
Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor 
organizations; OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees 
if the company is owned or affiliated with another company, or there is 
centralized ownership, control or management (such as central control of 
personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes 
a single enterprise, and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more 
employees.
 
B.  All federal contractors (private employers), who: (1) are not exempt as 
provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5, (2) have 50 or more employees, and (a) are 
prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors, and have a contract, 
subcontract, or purchase order amounting to $50,000 or more; or (b) serve as 
a depository of Government funds in any amount, or (c) is a financial 
institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and 
Notes. 

All multi-establishment employers, i.e. employers doing business at more than 
one establishment, must file: (1) a report covering the principal or 
headquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing 
50 or more persons; (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees 
by race, sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as 
well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees; and (4) a list, showing 
the name, address, total employment and major activity for each establishment 
employ-ing fewer than 50 persons, must accompany the consolidated report.

All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the 
headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for 
its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package.

For the purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any 
corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so 
that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary.

The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct 
govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or 
other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts.  Their line of 
thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits 
indirectly from the contract as well.   If GSP is completely free standing 
and they do not participate in Enron's benefits, abide by our policies or 
procedures , participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be 
funded by Enron Corp. , etc., they may have some type of argement not to 
comply  but I doubt it.  If we own them over 51% I don't see a way they could 
not file EEO-1's and have an AAP.  We do all the AAP's in Corporate so if 
this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know. 

Thanks!

Felecia

     Michelle and Peter, we (GSP) have determined that we are not a federal
     government contractor.  Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do
     sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal
     government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier'
     contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I
     have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him
     today.)  Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to
     abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors.

     Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare
     affirmative action plans.  In addition, we do not feel that we are
     subject to an OFCCP audit.

     Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not
     included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's
     status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1
     and AAPs.

     Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any
     of this.

David,

As we discussed, Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing 
Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he 
remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and 
other litigation matters.

We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin.  The 
terms of that Agreement would include:

1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel 
regarding litigation matters.  He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare 
for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as 
needed.

2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this 
cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to 
the terms of his employment agreement).  After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a 
rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.

3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary 
course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his 
employment with Enron.  Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or 
claims based upon the following:

  -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, 
  -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA,
  -- Kevin's intentional acts, 
  -- Kevin's gross negligence,
  -- Kevin's reckless conduct,
  -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other 
legal obligation, or 
  -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act.

4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 
2/1/01.  The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt.  In addition, 
all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of  the 
agreement.

Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.  I 
am available to participate in your call with him, if you would like me to 
attend.

Michelle

David,

I am in agreement with you on this.  This week, we lost an agreement that had 
options to be granted.  It did not make it to the Administrative Committee 
until 2 months after signing, and only because the employee came forward and 
asked about her grant.  Luckily for us, the strike price was better/lower.  
If it had been the other way around, we may have had a much bigger issue.

loop on VP and above deals, who liaises with legal and makes sure they are in 
loop on all,  etc.,)
Where is the accurate report of existing contracts, those under discussion 
and those top performers who we should think about.
How do we circulate this via HR leads to the OTC's to make sure that we are 
ahead of the game
How do we track the overall numbers, efforts and issues in regards to these 
contracts so that we can feedback a macro picture of their effectiveness.

I suggest we meet before weekend.

Drew,

Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who 
has had some issues.  I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his 
agreement.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you 
fax it to my house first thing in the morning?  713-218-7355 is the fax 
number.  If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to 
review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I 
will prepare on this topic.  I am going to be attending a seminar out of the 
office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.

I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and 
Louise for comment and dart-throwing.  I can be reached via my cell phone 
during the day at 713-302-5522.

Thanks, Drew.

Michelle

to?  My understanding is that you were going to do some research for us.

Michelle,

 I am unclear as to what you are asking for below.  Vinson & Elkins
needs additional information before it will be possible to turn another
draft of the plan.  Specifically, I was under the impression that you were
going to review the second draft and give me additional comments.  Also, we
are researching whether the plan will qualify as a bonus plan (vs. a top hat
plan) and need to resolve that issue.  But most importantly, we cannot draft
a deferral provision for purchasing stock options or phantom stock
appreciation rights until we know the details of that provision will be
(such as whether you want it to tie in with an existing stock incentive plan
and the details of how you want it to work).  I am happy to redistribute a
copy of the March 16 draft to anyone you wish. Please call me if you wish to
discuss this.

 Best regards,
 Jeanne Wilson

I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option
of
paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP incentive
plan.   She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.

Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the
plan.
Jeanne, could you please circulate one?

I'll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this
process should not wait for me.  Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we
should
be ready to finalize it.

Chuck,

Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?  Given the 
correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we 
probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from 
the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.  Otherwise, even if we do 
"agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.  I am ready to 
hear what this guy has to say about my client.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Michelle

Andrea,

I am supposed to follow up and work on our action plan for data integrity.  
However, I know that you are going to meet with David/Robert on the whole 
concept and that you proposed a work around for the near term after our 
sessions.  It appears as if our action plans will depend on the results of 
that meeting.  

I will be out of the office on Wed-Friday on business.  It looks like our 
action plan revisions are due on Friday (but, if necessary, I'll ask for an 
extension because of my travel).  In the meantime, you can meet with 
David/Robert and begin to look at revamping our prior efforts.

Alternatively, you can reconvene the group and work on revising action plans 
without me.  (I am not sure how helpful I am in any event).  What do you 
think?  

Michelle

PS, do we need to include Don in our group?

Hi John

The battery of tests includes the following:

a. Global Personality Inventory (GPI) 
description: The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data 
collected and developed by a team of industrial/organizational psychologists 
from around the world. The GPI measures personality for the work context in 
general and for professional for the work context and contains 37 distinct 
scales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models. 
Japan norms: Japanese mid-level, front-line manager, and individual 
contributor norms available. 

b. Advanced Progressive Matrices (Ravens)  
description: This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia 
through Coyne-Didsbury/PDI, and correlates highly with other tests of problem 
solving capacity. Global PDI manager/executive norms available.

c. Leadership Inventory-plus 
description: a PDI-structured tool used in the selection of entry and 
mid-level managers, measuring those basic abilities, traits, values, 
interests, and motivations that are critical to effective leadership. The LI+ 
includes both personality and cognitive ability (i.e., numerical, analytical, 
and verbal reasoning) components. U.S. manager norms available.

The intention is to use the testing on local hires (not US nationals) to 
confirm/expand on information gained in the interviewing process.  Reference 
checking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some 
objective abilities testing against standard norms.  The important thing is 
that we don't use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we 
take on a candidate or not.  

The bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important 
part of a high quality recruiting effort (and have been demonstrated as such 
in Australia on several occasions); unless there are significant legal 
impediments I want to proceed with them.

Thanks

I have raised the issue of testing with Michelle Cash, an ENA labor lawyer, 
whose comments and queries are set forth below, for your review.  Please 
reply to Michelle's specific queries in paragraph 3 of her e-mail.

Paul-

Following your review of the attached e-mail traffic, please provide us with 
the Japanese legal perspective on undertaking these types of activities.  
Also, based on your experience, inform us as to how testing of this nature 
may be perceived in the Japanese market.

Best regards,

John,

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice 
mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of 
issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits 
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for 
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain 
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there 
another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references 
from prior employers, etc.)?  

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that 
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the 
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine 
how to proceed.

Michelle

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to 
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes 
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment 
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed 
to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our 
use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you 
review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also 
appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with 
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it 
in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

Sorry about the earlier email! 

The following contains a summary of  high-level employment/labor issues based 
upon the review of the documents in the data room here in Houston.  We still 
need to have a conference call with the HR team at GP to ascertain the 
climate of labor relations and other employment issues.

Woodland

1.  Employment Claims:  In the list of insurance matters, there are several 
employment-related claims.  Those include sexual harassment allegations, 
disability discrimination, retaliation, and mistreatment.  It is unclear 
whether those are ongoing claims or not.  I would question whether the mill 
has had harassment prevention training, and if so, when.  Also, are there 
other employment claims that are not identified in the documents?    

2. Labor Union matters:  Rick Johnson is going to review the collective 
bargaining agreements.   I am waiting on a list of union grievances, which is 
supposed to be forwarded to me today.

3.  I saw nothing about employment contracts, change of control agreements, 
or other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing 
for either Woodland.

Leaf River 

1.  Litigation Summary:  The company provided a summary of litigation.  Three 
of the four are personal injury claims -- one is a fall down stairs by a 
delivery person (settled on 7/14/00); another is a contract employee who was 
injured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face, and the 
third is another contract employee who fell down some stairs (settled 
7/27/00).  The fourth is a race discrimination claim from 1991, which has 
been on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy.  The summary states that the 
corporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims.  
We may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this 
transaction.  Are there other litigation matters or pending claims?  (E.g., 
EEOC).

2.  No employment contracts.  I saw nothing about change of control 
agreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide 
post-closing payments.

3.  Workers Comp:  There are several workers comp claims for 1999 and 1998.  
I would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make 
sure that they are not unusual.

Dee Lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should 
provide a separate analysis on that topic.

Dave,

Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I 
ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that 
the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon 
we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be 
replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.

Thanks.

Mark,

Unfortunately, I do not know anything about EcoElectrica.  I contacted 
Michelle Blaine at the former EI (thinking that there was some confusion 
between Blaine and Cash).  Her assistant contacted me and said that, 
apparently, Coralina Rivera at the former EI has information about Eco 
Electrica in Puerto Rico.  I have left Coralina a message indicating that you 
are looking for information about EcoElectrica and requesting that she 
contact you directly.

Let me know if I can do anything further on this matter.

Michelle

I will look closely at the sample letters to see whether there is any way to 
avoid the conclusion you have reached, which appears to be the correct one.  
I have a meeting right now, and will focus on it right after that -- I'll 
send another email once I've completed that review early this afternoon.

Subject: Confidential  

Michelle, Melissa Laing and I talked to Jon Chapman today, and basically Jon 
deferred to you, since the RW employees in NY are a question for US 
employment law.

Melissa and I do believe that the  RW US-based employees that were given 
UK-style employment letters, such as the sample one I gave you, are our 
employees, because of those letters; they were given "offer letters" by MG 
before the MG/Enron deal went unconditional and in most cases they accepted 
them, so they were MG employees when all MG employees became our employees.  
If it is a fact that they are Enron employees, we have to figure out the 
liability associated with terminating them!  

It appears that on Monday, MG and Enron leadership will decide to exit some 
of the London and New York RW business that MG acquired, and some (minimum 9, 
max 15) of the former RW employees will need to be terminated during 
August.   John Sheriff and Gary Hickerson both want to know the cost of that 
decision.   Right now we are assuming that we are liable for the severance 
periods stated in the offer letters to the people; we would like to be able 
to avoid that cost  (estimated at $700k and $1.5M, depending on who is 
redundant) or reduce it if possible.  However, if it is your recommendation 
that we have to honor those letters, so be it.

If you have any questions, please call Melissa Laing (tie line 8303 6617) in 
the UK and she can find me.  Thanks.

Hoyt

Hoyt, I am convinced that the MG employees are ours.  The RW employees may or 
may not be ours.  It is my understanding that we own the assets of RW, and 
that we decided to hire certain, key personnel from RW.  The remaining RW 
employees do not automatically come with the assets.  I am working on 
obtaining more information on the RW side of things from lawyers here in the 
US.  Key to employment decisions will be provisions of the asset purchase 
agreement, if any are applicable.  You might check with Jon Chapman in the UK 
to see whether he has any more information on this point.  Thanks.  Michelle

Justin Boyd said he talked to you, are you convinced that the MG and RW 
employees are now ours?

Assuming that you do:

I will bring copies of all the offer letters MG wrote to RW employees, I 
think there are something like 27 or 28.  They are all very similar to the 
one or two that I have already given you.

I believe that we will not want to keep some of the businesses that are being 
acquired with Rudolph Wolff, particularly the FX business in New York.  
Naturally, some of the people in the potentially discontinued business 
received the onerous letters.  Gary Hickerson has to decide what he is going 
to do with this by August 18, if not sooner.  With the letters that were 
delivered , I would like to get an opinion from you on what we have to do to 
terminate the people associated with the business, assuming that Gary wants 
to shut it down.

Also, MG have 4 to 6 employees in Montreal.  We (HR) are trying to convince 
the business side that we do not want any people in Montreal because of the 
employment laws . . . but it does not appear that we will succeed.  We may 
reduce the size of the office, though, and we may not want to put them on the 
Canadian payroll, particularly is we only keep 1-2 people there.  Do you have 
contacts in Montreal that can advise us on how to terminate any employees 
that we choose to terminate?  What would be the Enron position on having them 
on a separate payroll from Enron Canada?

Thanks
Hoyt

		 Subject: Re: Company Structure File

Felecia, thanks so much for the listing of companies whose employees are paid 
directly by Enron which includes legal name, % ownership, employee count, 
etc.  Great work and excellent due diligence.  As we discussed, you are in 
the process of researching and documenting the same information for the 
non-payroll companies which of course is critical for completing our due 
diligence with respect to the new AESOP.

In order to get this information for determining AESOP participation, and as 
we dscussed today, we are asking the HR leadership team to work with their 
business units to provide us with all non-payroll company names (to provide 
legal name, if different), % ownership, whether or not the company is part of 
Enron's consolidated reporting group (if not, why) and number of employees.  
They will also give us a "yes" or "no" at this time as to whether their 
Business Unit Head wishes for the company to participate in AESOP.  We are 
asking them to forward this file to you, as we discussed, to assist you with 
data collection.  We would ask that you coordinate the necessary Legal review 
of ownership levels with Michelle Cash.  We will facilitate with Johnna Young 
a review of whether we will have any accounting issues with granting options 
to employees of each respective company.    We have a tight turnaround, of 
course, as outlined in today's meeting, but hopefully we have good game plan 
to get us to where we need to be.  

Note to Johnna:  Johnna, attached please see Felicia's file on domestic for 
your initial review.

Thanks again, Felecia, for your help.

Jeffrey,

Thanks for the "thanks."  Also, thanks to you for the big wine bucket.  We 
used it at our New Year's Day party, and it worked great.  I must admit, 
though, that I still don't understand the purpose of the round thing that 
goes in the bottom.

I heard that Nathan took 30 steps the other day.  That is awesome!!  I know 
that you are thrilled.

Cameron's birthday party will be March 18 at 3:30 at Gymboree.  If your kids 
will be able to attend, let me know.

Talk to you later -- gotta go now.

Michelle

Michelle-

Thanks for all the great Christmas gifts... I was thinking about you because
last night I was showing a friend Sim City, this morning I awoke to the
little portable clock, and was reading Texas Monthly in our library (you can
guess!).  The boys specially like the clock.  They've figured out how to
turn on the back lighting by pressing the snooze button.

We went to Shiner for the new year.  The Lewis' invited 3 other couples and
their kids.  We stayed up until about 2am playing cards and drinking
champagne (although I only had two glasses).

Nathan is getting more and more stable in his walking.  He took 10 steps
yesterday, the most ever.  He also stands for several minutes at a time,
learning how to balance himself.  He's at 19 months, 17 months adjusted.
Kiera walked at 16 months.  We will be very happy if he is walking soon,
given where he started.

Thanks again for the great gifts.

Hello!

An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.  There have been 
three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  The topic is 
technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th 
edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own 
time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously 
would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the 
book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary 
information, however.

What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is 
willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not 
think that would be worthwhile.  My opinion at this point is that she can do 
it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of 
course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.  I welcome 
your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.

Thanks for your thoughts.

Michelle

Great.  Our only plans are that we have tickets to the ballet on Saturday 
night.  If you want to attend, let me know, and we will get tickets.  It is 
Cleopatra -- a world premier -- and it should be entertaining.  I understand 
if you don't want to join us, though.  Ballet isn't for everyone.  Let me 
know.  Michelle

Mary, yes, it merely is a form issue.  Sharon and Kriste have consolidated 
those paragraphs in their form.  I will follow suit in mine to minimize

Subject: Clarification on Contract Language

Michelle --

As I am validating these contracts, I am seeing inconsistent language.  Can 
you help me here?  

It has to do with a severance payout after involuntary term.  In some cases 
it may be saying the same thing, but is showing up in different paragraphs.  
I'd prefer to have all the templates alike, if that's not a legal issue.


For VP & Above:

2.1b gives him one year's annual base and bonus
2.3    offsets the severance with the agreement payments

(i.e. Ozzie Pagan/ENA)

OR

1.3  states "Employee is not eligible for severance . . ."
2.1b gives him one year's annual base and bonus

(i.e. Franklin Bay/EBS)

OR

1.3  offsets the severance with agreement payments
2.1b gives him one year's annual base and bonus

(i.e. Mohan Gurunath/India -- contract dated July 27, 2000 -- but just 
received, so may be old language)



Under VP:

2.1b indicates payment continues under full term of contract
2.3   offsets the severance with the above

(i.eJohn Guerriero//Canada)

OR

1.3  states "Employee is not eligible for severance under the Enron Corp . . 
. . "
2.1b provides payments continue for the full term of contract
(2.3 Offset paragraph doesn't exist)

(a slew of EBS contracts just received)



It looks like there's two different templates floating around that are being 
used at random.  They may be saying similar things, but the calculations 
could be entirely different.

Can you let me know which ones are the correct combinations to be using?  
And, is there any way we can get all the templates to reflect it?

Thanks so much for your help.  And let me know if the above is about as clear 
as mud.  Just give me a call and we can talk about it.

Mary

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail to you, I would like to use 
contractors from the two firms listed below.  Both of these firms have 
contractors available now, so as soon as we get these agreements in place we 
can bring them in and put them to work.  If possible, I'd like any agreement 
we put in place to be flexible enough to allow us to use other contractors in 
the future besides those we currently have identified.  If you need me to do 
anything else or if you are not the right person to talk to, please let me 
know.  Thanks.

Michelle,
?
Sorry, I should have been more clear on the 4 - 6 % vacation  pay. That is 
the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to 
non-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent 
provisions in the collective agreement do not "meet or exceed" the  Act's 
provisions. Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than  the 
provisions in the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply to  
union employees.
?
In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective 
agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the 
year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but  
I'll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may  
actually have to take that time off without any pay if they've already 
elected  to take the pay earlier.
?
For both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued 
in one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be 
entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings.
?
With respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn't one, 
save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The 
letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent 
on Friday last week. If you don't have it, please let me know and  I'll send 
it.
?
There are also position descriptions for every union and  non-union employees 
that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might  also be considered 
part of the contract of employment, though they are not  incorporated into a 
letter of employment.
?
Hope that answers your questions. Please let me know if I may  be of further 
assistance.

Thanks,  Dean.

Two questions have arisen based upon your diligence  summary:

1.? Do you have a copy of the "standard" employment  letter?? We haven't
seen it (or, at least I haven't).
2.? What  is meant by the 4-6% vacation pay?? How does that work?? How  are
the pre-payments made?? Does the person get the money early and then  not
get paid for time off later on?? Additional explanations would be  helpful.

Thanks.

Michelle

Subject:? Celgar - Asbestos  Claims



Peter & Michelle,

Brian Hiebert forwarded to me  Peter's questions regarding the risk of
asbestos litigation at  Celgar.

Under the Workers Compensation Act, employers in British?  Columbia are
required to contribute to an accident fund which provides?  compensation for
injuries or occupational diseases arising out of employment.  In? turn,?the
Act?provides employers statutory immunity  from?damages? in respect of any
personal injury, disablement or  death arising out of and in? the course of
employment.

The  accident fund would cover asbestos claims. There are no
exceptions?which  would allow asbestos litigation?against employers.? The
Act  does?not prohibit?litigation against third parties, eg.?  manufacturers
of asbestos, but employers, as stated, are immune from  such? actions.

Compensation is payable if the worker sustains  pulmonary injury by a
disabling form of asbestosis. We will make the  appropriate enquires about
any? compensation paid to Celgar  employees.

Gina, I am not sure that the "Satisfactory" descriptor is accurate.  "Met" 
expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in 
Satisfactory.  Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would 
be more accurate.

Where are we on the total revamp?  Has that been postponed until next year?

Just when you thought it was safe . . . 

I have received a question from NEPCO about Project 50.  Apparently, they 
have temporary employees who work on projects and then leave the company.  
These are hourly employees who do not work regularly.  Originally, these 
employees were thought to be included in the scope of Project 50 by corp.  
Mike Indivero called me and said that these people should not receive the 50 
options because they are not "regular, full-time or regular part-time 
employees" as described in the memo from the Office of the Chairman.

What are  your thoughts on that?  Should they be included or not? My reading 
of the email to all employees is that it does not include temporary 
employees.  Do you know how other temporary employees were treated?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks, as always.

Don't know that this alternative would be too appealing to the candidate, but 
I can explore it with Mark.

What would happen if we hire him as an Enron employee, he has a mid year

terminate for non-performance?

What about payrolling through an agency so that he is on a contract-to-hire

evaluating the situation before making a regular, full-time offer.  Customers 
understand contract-to-hire concept, so it may not raise "lack of commitment"

Michelle,

Mark Tawney has a situation where he wants to hire a Manager level person in 
the Chicago office on a trial basis as a Marketer of Weather products.

This is a trial effort and if it fails, there would be no job for him in 
Houston or otherwise.  Mark is thinking that a 6-9 month evaluation period 
would be adequate to determine success.  How would you recommend that we 
structure an offer that gives us an out if the initiative fails.  We thought 
about hiring him as a contractor or consultant in order to minimize our 
commitment, but we're concerned that if our potential customers learn of his 
employment status, it may appear to our customers that we are not committed 
to the effort or the market.  Mark is willing to be completely above board 
with the candidate that this may or may not work.

My belief is that we are going to have more of this exact situation in EGM.  
Kevin McGowan is also looking for a Marketer for Coal.  The people they are 
targeting have sales backgrounds and would not be re-deployable in other 
parts of Enron.

My goal is to minimize our exposure on the front end!

Shanna

Subject: Thanks for draft contract

Seems we are close but a few things are different than my spreadsheet we 
discussed. Here are my comments:

1 - I think this needs to be a UK form contract rather than US. Otherwise I 
think it is difficult for me to mainatin all the UK benefits (Pension, share 
plan etc.,). All numbers bar base can stay in US$'s. The Base will need to be 
translated at 1.5 into UKpds (ie pds150,000 then the car allce subtracted 
pds10,800 and shown as such) and state in the contract how much should be 
paid on US payroll and how much in UK (my current arrangements allows me to 
keep about pds600 per month paid in the UK so I can pay UK bills). I am happy 
to prepare a draft of this is you wish for Michelle and John Chapman to 
review.

2 - I'd like confirmation that new base is effective June 1, 2000. This is 
when we started these discussions.

3 - The cash retention amounts of pds45,000 are missing. We agreed this would 
be paid 3/01 and 3/02.

4 - There are 3 stock option grants on appendix A of $100k each, but I 
believe we agreed $120k on signing and $120k 6/01. Additionally given you 
were uncomfortable with additional base bump in Jan 01 I suggested we add 
that $25k to the second option grant making it $120k in options on signing 
and $145k in 6/01. Incidentally, can we make these clearly 5 year options 
with standard vesting (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).

5 - On Bonus targets, can we insert top 25% as a VP, top 50% otherwise, after 
each target.

6 - On ENE LTI awards, I believe we agreed this years award of $300 would be 
guaranteed. For 01 I would like again wording saying "as a VP" inserted after 
25% target and top 50% otherwise.

7 - Not sure if we need to but obviously the Relo memo might need to be 
referenced with regards to this not being the sole agreement etc.,

Thanks

David

Subject: Re: Part-time exempt employees  

Felicia,

In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before 
someone can be classified as exempt.  However, because there are certain 
exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not 
have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to 
whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.

My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by 
these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If 
they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them 
affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the 
overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the 
overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not 
be an issue.

Let me know if you have questions.

Michelle

Subject: Part-time exempt employees

Sharon and Michelle,

We have 29 employees in the payroll system that are part-time exempt 
employees and their pay is calculated on an hourly rate.  Unless I understand 
the FLSA incorrectly we cannot in any way calculate salaries on exempt 
employees on an hourly basis.  If they are reduced hours we would need to 
determine how we would value their job based on a salary basis otherwise we 
are treating them as hourly employees and not exempt employees.   An exempt 
employee should only be tracking exception time (i.e. sick, vacation, etc -- 
any off duty time) but not work hours during the day.   An exempt worker 
according the FLSA can only be paid on a fee basis or salary basis -- not on 
an hourly basis.  If I am off base let me know, otherwise I would like your 
help with how we should approach getting this corrected and possibly having 
this covered in a policy on how to deal with employees performing exempt jobs 
that are working part-time or reduced schedules. 

Look forward to hearing back from you.

		 Subject: Overtime Calculations



As we discussed on the telephone last week, the federal Fair Labor Standards
Act and Department of Labor regulations prescribe the calculation of the
regular rate of pay for overtime pay calculation.  Shift differentials and
other adjustments for working particular hours or on particular tasks are
included in the regular rate of pay.  If, as set forth in the e-mail
forwarded to me from Kerry, an employee is paid a shift differential for
night shift work, that differential becomes part of the regular rate of pay
for the night shift work.  If the same employee rotates between day and
night shifts, she/he will be working at two different rates of pay.  This is
acceptable but poses special issues for the calculation of overtime.

Federal law permits two methods of calculating overtime for employees who
work at two (or more) different regular rates of pay.  Employers may use
either a weighted average (29CFR 778.115) or a rate-in-effect (29CFR
778.419) calculation.

l. Weighted Average Calculation

This calculation involves add multiplying the number of hours worked in a
workweek at rate 1 times rate 1 and adding the sum to the number of hours
worked at rate 2 times the number of hours worked at rate 2.  The sum is
then divided by the total number of hours worked to obtain the weighted
average regular rate paid for each hour worked.  Overtime premiums of 1/2
the weighted average regular rate are then paid to bring the overtime rate
to 1.5 times the weighted average regular rate.   If, as in California,
double time rates apply, the premium would be one times the weighted average
regular rate.

Example:

Employee works four 8-hour day shifts at $10 per hour and two 8-hour night
shifts with a shift premium of $! per hour within the same workweek.

The weighted average calculation would be:

32 (hours) times 10 (dollars) plus 16 (hours) times 11 (dollars) = 496
(dollars)

496 (dollars) divided by 48 (hours) = $10.33 (the weighted average regular
rate)

1/2 of $10.33 = $5.17 (the additional overtime premium due for each overtime
hour worked).

The weekly pay for this employee would be:

$584.00 for straight time
$ 41.36 for overtime premium
or

$625.36 for the week.


2. Rate-in-effect
With this method, the overtime pay is calculated at the rate in effect at
the time the overtime is worked.

In the above example, if the last 8 hours of the week were worked on a day
shift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $10 or $15 and the employee would be
entitled to $120 in overtime pay.  If the last shift was worked on the night
shift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $11 or $16.50 and the employee would
be due $130 in overtime pay.

Please note: These are the federal standards.  State law must also be
considered, since the employee is entitled to the most favorable provision
is there is a conflict.  For example, California does not permit the use of
the rate-in-effect method; employees who work at different rates must be
paid on the weighted average overtime pay calculation.

I hope this is helpful.  Please do not hesitate to call if you questions or
need clarification.

John

This note is to confirm our recent telephone conversation.

There are no rules restricting the use of such testing in Japan and it is
becoming more common.

However, it is still likely to viewed askance by potential employees above a
certain level, e.g. those being hired as director, or because of their 
standing
in the business community.  This is probably the same as for similar level
employees in other countries.

Phil-

I have raised the issue of testing with Michelle Cash, an ENA labor lawyer,
whose comments and queries are set forth below, for your review.  Please
reply to Michelle's specific queries in paragraph 3 of her e-mail.

Paul-

Following your review of the attached e-mail traffic, please provide us
with the Japanese legal perspective on undertaking these types of
activities.  Also, based on your experience, inform us as to how testing of
this nature may be perceived in the Japanese market.

Best regards,

John,

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your
voice mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because
of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is
there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g.,
references from prior employers, etc.)?

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine
how to proceed.

Michelle

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have
agreed to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as
to our use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can
you review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would
also appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from
it in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

What about payrolling through an agency so that he is on a contract-to-hire 
basis?  That way, we can say that the intent is to hire, but that we are 
evaluating the situation before making a regular, full-time offer.  Customers 
understand contract-to-hire concept, so it may not raise "lack of commitment" 
jitters.

What do you think?

Subject: Weather Candidate

Michelle,

Mark Tawney has a situation where he wants to hire a Manager level person in 
the Chicago office on a trial basis as a Marketer of Weather products.

This is a trial effort and if it fails, there would be no job for him in 
Houston or otherwise.  Mark is thinking that a 6-9 month evaluation period 
would be adequate to determine success.  How would you recommend that we 
structure an offer that gives us an out if the initiative fails.  We thought 
about hiring him as a contractor or consultant in order to minimize our 
commitment, but we're concerned that if our potential customers learn of his 
employment status, it may appear to our customers that we are not committed 
to the effort or the market.  Mark is willing to be completely above board 
with the candidate that this may or may not work.

My belief is that we are going to have more of this exact situation in EGM.  
Kevin McGowan is also looking for a Marketer for Coal.  The people they are 
targeting have sales backgrounds and would not be re-deployable in other 
parts of Enron.

My goal is to minimize our exposure on the front end!

Shanna

Would you or someone in your group please investigate the allegations raised 
by Janeth Rodriguez-Philhower?  Based upon her voice mail message, there is a 
strong possibility of litigation.  Your investigation into her allegations 
thus would be conducted in anticipation of litigation.

Once you have conducted the investigation, please provide me with the results.

Thank you.

Craig,

We were supposed to have a conference call with labor/employment personnel 
early next week.  Has that been scheduled yet?  Also, I will not be able to 
attend at 4:00 on Tuesday, but will see if someone from HR/benefits can be 
there.

Subject: Toucan Meeting -- Tuesday Afternoon

Please attend a meeting in EB2988 at 4 pm on Tuesday, October 31st. If you 
are unavailable to attend please have someone represent you at the meeting.

The plan for the meeting is to:

Go through individuals' findings regarding completeness of information 
available in data room binders, issues encountered that my impact the value 
of the assets to Enron, and any additional information required for Leaf 
River and Woodland.
Provide an update regarding the status of Woodland and deal stopper issues.

The issue relating to Woodland and the hesitancy to fully proceed on the due 
diligence relates to two potential deal stoppers -- security of fiber supply 
and labor union issues. Our preference was to better understand these issues 
before fully engaging in the due diligence process, and incurring the 
associated costs, but the constrained timing has limited our ability to 
accomplish that. At this stage it appears as though we will proceed to submit 
a mid-November bid, and therefore we should proceed with all necessary due 
diligence for Woodland.

Craig

FYI - see Jerrel's response to my query below.  This is the first I've ever 
seen or heard that this was a "condition to closing."  
Dan/Rob - is this true?  

To me the cost is irrelevant since Jerrel is the only Director affected and 
because of his actions (and/or lack thereof) the company can't afford to 
cover him.

Answering backwards - D&O insurance is exceedingly expensive for small firms
to secure, thus most do without it.  Second, it was a condition when we
closed and McConville/Lambert, et al researched it through Enron Risk
Management, Don Marshall, and stated that it was in place automatically for
any majority owned merchant investment.  A confirmation letter was promised
on 14 July and when pressed in September Lambert finally got around to
issuing the letter to Carl and me that I mentioned earlier.

I'm not very experienced in these matters so I'm checking with the folks
here.  Can you explain why Enron should cover non-Enron directors?  Why
doesn't Ecogas have its own insurance?  Any help you can provide is
appreciated.

Amy,

It looks like my presence in Portland is iffy at this point.  There are other 
ways to do the training if you still want it asap.  Otherwise, I can schedule 
it a few weeks from now.  I'll give you the details as I confirm my situation

As of now, does this date still work for you?  I want to get out information

I hope that you are well.

Can you let me know how long the sessions take and what a good number is so 
that I can get these scheduled?

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Subject:  "No Excuse" Girls Night  (Document link: Michelle Blaine)

Hello everyone!!

Well, no one is celebrating anything specific, so we haven't had an
opportunity
for the girls to get together in a while.  Therefore, we have decided to
have a
NO Excuses Girls Night.

The proposed date is Friday, Sept. 29 -- Are there any major conflicts with
this
date?

Proposed place is to be determined.  Debbie Rank suggested that a restaurant
would be the easiest.  I offered to have it at my house, but she was
concerned
that I would get stuck doing too much and spending too much.  My thought is
that
if everyone agrees to chip in a bit, we can have it catered, and no one will
have to do too much or pay too much.  What do you think about that?

If you are interested, let me know.

Also, this first email is limited to those persons for whom I had email
addresses.  Many others should be added to this list, including:  Mary
Thamm,
Lisa Anouilh, Deanne Noel, Tamberly Thomas, and others whom I am sure to
have
forgotten.  Please forward this on and have everyone get back to me if they
can
attend or have a different suggestion.

My email is:  michelle.cash@enron.com.  Phone number 713-853-6401.  More
details
to come . . .

Michelle

Melissa,

I gave his attorney a call just to tell him that we received his letter.  He 
mentioned to me that Tony's primary concern is the nonsolicitation.  Although 
I think Tony is being a little more reasonable than John Paskoff, we need to 
be somewhat consistent with what we provide both of them.  They are both very 
close.

I think the following would be a fair offer for both of them.

Additional 15,000.  This would give Paskoff and additional 2.5 months salary 
and Cirino almost 2 months salary.  This get them closer to the 12-13 months 
pay they are both asking for.  Plus, Michelle brought up a point about them 
incurring attorney's fees and this should well cover it.
Payment of their COBRA premiums through the term of their MG contract ( 9 mos 
)
No  on the bonus payments
No on waiving or reducing the non solicitation of customers, unless Hutch 
want's to accommodate this.

They will probably both push back on the non solicitation, but I would rather 
wait to see how theyr respond to our offer.

Michelle, what are your thoughts?

Thanks
Cathy

Mike Hutchninson is out of the office until Monday, so I will follow up with

With regard to the claims, what is your opinion?  I would suggest that most

Sally Alvarez, Charla Stuart, Karen Moore and Mark Wilson have been working 
on the development of concepts for the new Enron daycare center scheduled to 
open the fall of 2001.  They have developed 3-5 alternatives and will be 
holding open forum type focus groups on:

December 11th and 12th in room EB49C3 from 11 am to 1 pm.


If your schedule allows we would love to have you stop by and provide your 
feedback.  In addition, if you know of employees within your companies that 
would like to provide input please extend the offer to them.  

Our Wellness group is also working with Karen Moore to develop potential new 
names for the Body Shop.  If they are ready by the 11th, we will also solicit 
input on these as well.

Thanks in advance for your help

Gina, I will leave this to your discretion.  I agree that the OD&T people 
could help us in the communication/training side of any changes that are 
made.  Comp. probably will not be affected much, since Needs Improvement and 
Issues both are no bonus/no merit categories.  Thanks.  Michelle

Thanks Michelle.
One question:  Since this issue surrounds compensation and OD&T, have we 
considered a compensation and OD&T person to participate in this review?  I 
would recommend the leaders of the appropriate councils be involved.

Andrea, 

You are right.  I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I 
was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who 
was setting up the meeting.  I apologize for the oversight -- it was not 
intentional.  I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent 
meetings.  I am sorry about this one.  

Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC -- is it a 
compensation system or a feedback system?  Because the process tries to 
address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp, 
promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)  This 
tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the 
fact that we have a comparative rating system.  This tension has given people 
lots of heartburn.  

To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create 
too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that 
comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we 
evaluate employees.  The preference was to go to numbered categories instead 
of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and 
the comparative rating.  For example, a "strong" performer really could be 
excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third 
category.  For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be 
problematic.  Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the 
categories to get away from the old "HR" language.  For example, a category 1 
performer would have a descriptor that said something like:  "Always raises 
the bar; franchise player," etc. rather than a "HR" definition relating to 
demonstrating criteria.  Also, people had the view that needs improvement and 
issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference 
between the two.

There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem 
more competitive.  Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC 
appeared to be a "black box," and the desire to explain and communicate more 
about the process.

This was only the first meeting.  I will make sure that you are invited to 
attend any subsequent ones, and I apologize for the first one.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

I had previously asked to be involved in this meeting but do not recall 
getting a invitation.  Would you please send me a copy of the details of this 
meeting?  Are there any other follow-up meetings scheduled?

Subject: Potential Change of Cluster Descriptors for PRC Reviews

As I noted, I attended a meeting yesterday to discuss the possibility of 
changing the current descriptors used in PRC (Superior through Issues) to a 
numeric rating 1-6 (or possibly 1-5 by combining the Needs Improvement and 
Issues categories).  The numeric ratings would be based on more relative 
behavioral descriptors to categorize an employee's performance, and not the 
absolute standards that the current descriptors represent.  

I have been tasked with drafting the verbiage for this possible change which 
will, of course, require review and approval by the senior levels of the 
organization.  In the interim I would appreciate knowing how this change 
might affect the system and current development  and compatibility of the 
data from mid-year to year end, assuming the change is approved.

I look forward to your comments and input.  Thanks in advance,

Gina

Subject: Use of Enron's name in GSP recruiting



Gentlemen, Michelle Cash in Legal has reviewed the engineering advertisement

that we put together for campus and had the comments below.  Michelle is
concerned about how much we tie Enron into the document.

I revised the document as Michelle suggested, see engradv3.  It does not
have
quite the flow that the preceding document had.

Let's discuss this document next week when we are all in New Jersey.  David,
you
might want to talk to Michelle about the bigger issue of keeping Enron's
name
separate from GSP, her phone number is 853.6401

I agree with the issue of de-emphasizing Enron in the communications.  I
would suggest that the communication, as written, could be used to imply
that the candidate would be an Enron employee.  If possible, we should say
that GSP is an LLC that currently is owned 100% by Enron, because, as I
understand it, Enron is going to sell down portions of that facility.
Thus, I want to manage the expectations that the person would be an "Enron"
person.

Could you please forward this message?

Thanks.  Michelle

     your discussion with David Howe about the Enron influence, perhaps we
     need to have some writeup that states what we should say and what we
     should not say.

     Jim Burkhead: Dave (Syracuse) and Marty (Miami Ohio) are both going to
     campus on the 14th.  If you could move your date at Maine up to that
     week from the 29th, then we could convene after all three interview
     trips and decide who we want to bring on-site.

     I propose (based on Marty's suggestion) that we try to bring all our
     leading candidates in for a mill visit on the same day (or perhaps one
     day for Dec grads and one day for May grads, if we get that many
     interested candidates), preferably the last week of November.  It will
     be a busy day, but then we can knock it all out then.

     Regarding your campus visits, we are looking for at least two process
     engineers, December grads are fine (actually preferred at the present
     time), and we should also look at environmental engineers if they are
     available at the school you are visiting.  In order to hire two
     process engineers, we probably have to bring eight in for a mill
     visit.

     Margo, is there any way we can get some GSPCLLC brochures or handouts
     for Jim, Mary and Dave to use on campus?

FYI, Houston Legal is recommending that we do not emphasize the Enron
connection.  I think that we are probably okay with the reference to Enron
in
the attached blurb that Marty and Dave put together (attached) but let's
avoid
suggesting to candidates that they can hire on here and then move into
Enron.
Jim and Marty, when you send the attached doc to campus, you might want to
add
your name at the bottom in addition to Dave's to make sure that the
students

know that they can contact you.

David Howe and Mike Parker, do you want to go to any of these campus
visits?


Thanks, Hoyt

     Dave, do you have a date set up?  Let's talk.  go ahead and send it to
     Syracuse.

     Jim Burkhead is working on Maine, i have to call Rutgers and NJIT.
     But I would really like to find 2 Dec grads from the paper schools if
     we could.

     I believe the attached document is the final version for the process
     engineering position. Please review it. If it looks OK I would like to
     send it off to Syracuse to be posted in the Pulp and Paper Science
     Department. I will schedule a recruiting trip there in November.

     Is anyone going to Maine or Rutgers/NJIT?

     Dave

The following message and attachements are from Brian Hiebert:

Enclosed for your review and comment is both a clean copy and a blacklined 
draft of the proposed form of Asset Purchase Agreement prepared by the 
solicitors for the receiver, KPMG.

I have taken that agreement and redrafted it to provide for direct 
representations and warranties from the Banks to Enron regarding such issues 
as title, status of contracts, financial statements, and otherwise.

This agreement should be viewed as a preliminary draft only as I did not have 
the benefit of reviewing the schedules which will form part of the 
agreement.  I understand those schedules are being prepared and will be 
forwarded to us together with a possibly revised version of this agreement.  
Also coming over is a form of debt purchase agreement.

Once I have received those agreements and have had an opportunity to review 
them together with their schedules I expect further changes will result.  
Further changes may also result from the continuation of due diligence 
through the course of this week and next.

However, I think the enclosed is a dramatic improvement from Enron's 
perspective over the form of purchase and sale agreement proposed by KPMG.

I look forward to discussing this with you.  In the meantime, if you have any 
questions please feel free to give me a call.

Subject: Prospective Buyer Issues

Per my v-mail: I'm actively engaging prospective buyers for Ecogas (ENA's 
stock).  A couple of questions:

Under the "Come-Along" provision [Sec. 8(d)(ii)] of the Stockholder's and 
Voting Agreement am I correct assuming that if ENA finds a willing buyer and 
acceptable price that we can effectively require/force all other shareholders 
to sell under the same terms, etc...?  
If the terms of such a sale included non-cash items (stock, stock options, 
gas contracts, power contracts, tolling agreements, etc....) is it also 
correct to assume that those items would be valued (for the non-ENA 
shareholders) at "Fair Market Value" pursuant to Sec. 7?
In some cases the discussions are elevating quickly to very senior levels and 
there are certain questions that are being asked and/or going to be asked 
relative to the Securities Purchase Agreement, Business Opportunities 
Agreement, JB Employment Agreement and Stockholder's and Voting Agreement.  
Assuming the prospective buyer is under a Conf Agrmt, are there any 
restrictions to my discussing or disclosing material facts relative to these 
agreements and/or providing them a copy?

I appreciate your feedback ASAP.

RTM

At one point in time, many years ago, we required EDS to have a DOT drug and 
alcohol testing program for their DOT-covered employees, who were the IT 
people working at our sites, since they were doing the same job as Enron 
employees and were considered DOT.  We should probably look carefully at 
their current jobs to determine if they are DOT-covered or not.  If they are 
performing DOT-covered jobs, their employer should be required to have a DOT 
Drug and Alcohol Testing program, if not it is not necessary to test them on 
a random basis.  The only random testing this company allows is for 
DOT-covered  and safety sensitive employees in NEPCO and OEC.  Also we have 
no means to test employees from other companies since our random selection is 
accomplished through our payroll system, nor do we want to be in the business 
of testing other's employees.   Hope that helps.  Susan T.

Susan,

The question of random drug testing of non-DOT employees who work 
side-by-side with DOT employees has come up (see below).  My understanding is 
that we do not do random tests except for DOT personnel.  First, am I 
correct?  Second, have we ever done random testing in this type of 
situation?  Your experience would be helpful.

Thanks.

Sounds like they have a precedence for doing it.  This is a question for 
Michelle Cash.     I would not test non-Dot employees unless there was a 
significant reason.   However, I have worked in a DOT environment and 
understand the desire to test them all.   I don't think it is good practice.

Gary, what is your opinion of non-DOT employees being subject to random drug 
tests?  This IT department supports the Gas Controllers,  who are subject to 
random drug tests.  My only concern is if we enforce this policy with one IT 
group and not the rest of the group, is that fair?

Subject: DOT random drug testing program

During the EDS to Enron transition I asked about getting the IT staff 
supporting Gas Control into the random drup testing program within Enron. Per 
the transition agreement, EDS had continued the program with an external drug 
testing vendor after we were outsourced to EDS back in 1985. We need to get 
our staff into the Enron internal program. Not everyone in my group is 
effected, but most are. I've listed the names below. The Gas Control support 
staff is framiliar with the program and aware that they are required to 
participate. I haven't heard anything about it from anyone since the 
transition back to Enron so I am assuming this slipped through the cracks.

The staff listed below all support Gas Control, have access to the SCADA 
systems, and could have significant impact to the operation of the 
applications used in Gas Control to monitor and control the pipeline.

Subject: Agreements with non-employee contractors



Michelle,

While I think that "Enron" discourages entering into agreements for services
directly with non-employee contractors, there are times when a business
decision is made to do so on a very limited basis.  Aside from other legal
issues, one single issue that has received a lot of attention in recent years
is the issue addressed by the Microsoft case involving the question under
what circumstances are individuals designated as independent contractors
entitled to employee benefits provided by  an employer to its employees.

While we have amended the various employee benefit plans to address this
issue, another place where it can be effectively addressed is in the contract
for services.

Recently, I was involved with a project to develop provisions to be included
in such a service agreement with non-employee contractors who will not be
entitled to employee benefits.  I thought you might have an interest in this,
so I have attached the contract provisions that were developed for this
circumstance along with an analysis.

I wonder if there are other attorneys who design and draft such agreements
who would be interested in receiving this information?

Regards,

Pat

Hello!

An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.  There have been 
three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  The topic is 
technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th 
edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own 
time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously 
would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the 
book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary 
information, however.

What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is 
willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not 
think that would be worthwhile.  My opinion at this point is that she can do 
it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of 
course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.  I welcome 
your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.

Thanks for your thoughts.

Michelle

Privileged and Confidential 
Attorney-Client Communication
This E-Mail Contains Legal Advice

In the Barbed Wire Purchase Agreement is the provision that the Purchaser has 
45 days to identify those employees of Company whom it would like the Company 
to terminate from employment prior to closing.  The Seller is providing a 
limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.  The 
indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those 
employees.  This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the 
basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc.  The indemnity exclusion also could 
be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.

Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under 
that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.  I 
can assist  you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and 
determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.

Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.

I understand that Amy Fitzpatrick will be moving from Enron Europe to 
Portland in the near future as her husband is relocating back to the states.

As you will no doubt be dealing with Amy going forward, I thought I would let 
you know that she has worked extensively with myself and Jon Chapman and is 
also the HR rep for the Legal Department in Europe.  She has done an 
outstanding job and is an absolute pleasure to work with, so we are very 
disappointed to lose her.  However, our loss is your gain and I have asked 
her to look you up when she goes to Houston.

Speak to you soon.
Michael

Hello!

Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.  As I mentioned 
to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.

Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the 
unionized employees.   I'll provide details as I learn them.

I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.

Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

I have discussed with Melissa and it does not seem to impact them; in fact, I
think it messes them up in London from a legal standpoint if they offer
redeployment.  I also think that we are going to reduce the redeployment
possibilities for the NYC staff and the time given to them to find an Enron
job (which led to my phone call this afternoon re putting term letters
together for them next week).    But I will let Melissa address the question!

Michelle,

I have asked Sarah Reyna, Finley Biggerstaff's assistant to send to you 
copies of the collective bargaining agreements, the employment agreements 
with senior management (there is only one, for Fred Inglis, the plant 
manager) and all benefit material.  I am also making copies of relevant 
sections of the AGRA Simons report regarding union and labor matters.  
Michelle, we only got copies of the due diligence materials and the AGRA 
Simons report on Thursday.  Indeed, I am waiting for the benefits documents 
to arrive with this morning's express mail.  

Your contact at Davis & Co, our Canadia counsel in Vancouver, is Dean 
Crawford (604) 643-2951, dccrawford@davis.ca.  Our principal contact at Davis 
& Co. is Brian Hiebert, (604) 643-2917, fax: 687-1612, 
brian_hiebert@davis.ca.  I have not met Dean, but understand from Brian that 
he is a senior employment attorney with experience with the provincial labor 
ministry.  I understand that Dean is currently reviewing the CBAs, the Inglis 
employment agreement, benefits documents, union grievance records, workers 
compensation claims records and human rights complaints files.  Davis & Co. 
have prepared consents to be signed by KPMG as receiver for Stone Venepal 
(Celgar) Inc., owner of the mill, in order to get access to correspondence 
between Stone Venepal and the Workers Compensation Board.  

I trust I will see you at the Celgar metting at 10:00 am today in 27C2.

Peter

David,

The "gardening leave provision would apply beyond the term.

I will make your tweak to 3.4.

I checked the 12-months with Clayton Utz, and they thought it was ok.

I'll forward a new draft in the next day or so.  Hope you had a good trip 
back.

Michelle thanks, Only one point -  it was my understanding that the 
"gardening leave" provision would also apply to a resignation after the end 
of the 2 year period. In other words if I resigned in 4 years (and assuming 
no further service contract had been put in place) the company could prevent 
me taking another job for upto 3 months after the termination if there was 
pay for that period.

Two other points;
The new paragraph in 3.4 could be read to infer that the Monthly Base Salary 
for the non-compete period would be paid up-front. Would it be safer to pay 
monthly conditional upon compliance with the obligations?
Have we thought about the enforcability of the 12 month non-compete for 
resignations during the term? This is not a concern to me and I am content 
with the existing arrangement for my contract. However, as a far as the 
precedent is concerned I would like a provision we could definitely enforce.

I will call you tomorrow to discuss.

Kathy, I think we should do some sort of an assignment agreement.  It does 
not have to be as long and involved as our current ones, but we should paper 
it up.  Michelle

Michelle:

Gary Hanks is putting together a plan on how to better utilize his team in 
supporting Bridgeline with their gas control training.  It may result in 
having his team rotate during this one-month cross-training.  With this, do 
we need to put together assignment letters indicating they will be rotating 
on a monthly basis or can this just happen without an assignment letter.  I 
don't think we need to add any additional compensation for this one-month 
cross training.   All expenses will be paid by Texaco.

Let me know what you think.

     Michelle and Peter, we (GSP) have determined that we are not a federal
     government contractor.  Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do
     sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal
     government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier'
     contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I
     have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him
     today.)  Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to
     abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors.

     Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare
     affirmative action plans.  In addition, we do not feel that we are
     subject to an OFCCP audit.

     Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not
     included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's
     status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1
     and AAPs.

     Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any
     of this.

     Hoyt

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to 
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes 
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment 
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed 
to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our 
use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you 
review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also 
appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with 
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it 
in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

Subject: Project Triple Lutz -- HR Issues with Bidder D

This email summarizes my conversation on employee matters with Nancy Quigg 
Young, which took place  yesterday.

Logistics.  The most significant area for the employee matters involves the 
logistics of the buyer hiring the employees.  In the original agreement that 
we proposed, we would allow the buyer to interview employees, select the ones 
they wanted to hire, and require that the buyer keep them employed for at 
least 2 years.  Their counter proposal was that they got to hire who they 
wanted, have us pay severance on all others, and they would have no 
obligation to keep them for any length of time.

Since then, there have been discussions internally that we want all employees 
to go with the sale, with the buyer taking the action of severing employees 
(although we would fund severance costs under the Enron formula).  I raised 
that proposal with Nancy, who is going to discuss it with her business 
clients.  

In the alternative, if the buyer selects the people it hires, and we have to 
eliminate the jobs for those not selected, I informed her that we would 
require an indemnity for claims made against us based on the selection 
process.  

Base Salary.  The counteroffer made by Bidder D does not provide that the 
employees hired from HPL would receive at least the same base salary as they 
earn at Enron.  This is important because a severance payment could be due if 
an employee does not accept a job at a lower salary.  Karen appeared 
unwilling to agree to pay divested employees outside of the buyer's salary 
bands (note:  paying outside of a salary band in the context of an 
acquisition is standard procedure, but she was acting as if it were an 
incredibly difficult accomplishment).  She claimed that one problem lies in 
not knowing the exact salary for each employee at issue.  We pushed back on 
this and offered to provide average salaries for each job level, to allow her 
to get comfortable with the ranges.  Fran Mayes will provide this 
information, which may eliminate this issue.

Bonus.  In our proposal, we asked that the hired employees receive a total 
bonus payment that is at least equal to what they earned their last year at 
Enron.  Bidder D did not provide any such guarantee.  Karen said that she 
needed our "bonus formula" before she could commit to this.  I explained that 
we have no bonus formula and that our bonuses are based on performance of the 
company and the individual.  We previously had provided total bonus amounts 
for the entire group, and she could make a determination of bonus costs on a 
consolidated basis for her deal folks to calculate.  j

She said she was "not sure if they could get there" on the bonus issue, 
particularly since she thinks our bonuses will be extra high this year.  I 
offered to discuss whether we could modify the amounts by averaging the last 
two years, which she thought might make it better.  

Unvested Equity.  When I explained to her that we could not supervest 
unvested options, she indicated that there was a "possibility" that the 
amount could be made up in stock options of Bidder D.  I think this is the 
"win-win" position, but I think it will have to be pushed.

Vacation.  Their vacation plan maxes out at 4 weeks; ours maxes out at 5 
weeks.  She thinks she may be able to propose that, for the first year the 
employees work for the buyer, they can use the vacation accrual from Enron, 
but after that, they are subject to the buyer's vacation plan.  This approach 
is reasonable.

WARN Act.  There is the slight possibility of WARN Act implications, in the 
unlikely event that closing occurs within 60 days of signing.  The WARN  Act 
requires a company to give employees 60 days notice of a plant closing or 
mass layoff.  This situation probably would qualify.  Thus, we would have to 
give 60 days notice to all employees who potentially may be affected.  We can 
pay in lieu of notice, in the event that the closing (and thus the 
terminations) occur sooner than 60 days after closing, but we may want to 
spell out who bears that cost, if it is incurred.

Benefits.  Other than the vacation benefit described above, it appears that 
Bidder D has benefits that generally are of the same nature as Enron's 
benefits.  Thus, allowing the hired employees to participate in the buyer's 
benefits plans, with credit for years of service at Enron, likely would be 
comparable to their situations here.

I expect that we will hear from Bidder D with their proposals on these issues 
once Fran provides Nancy with the salary data.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.

Michelle

Attached is a marked version of the Assignment Agreement with our initial 
comments.  In addition to the comments marked, we also have a few other 
questions.

Although we do not object to it being mentioned twice, why is the lease 
assigned pursuant to this Assignment Agreement when there is also a separate 
lease assignment agreement?

How was the employment of the persons listed on Exhibit A to the Assignment 
Agreemement effected?  Were they terminated or did they resign?  Is there any 
documentation regarding this?

We may have further comments after review by Enron and our labor attorney.  
Please call Cle at (713) 221-1314 or me at (713) 221-1131 with your comments.

WORK DESCRIPTIONS (LONG AND SHORT FORM)



	


I talked briefly to Carmen this morning about plans to revise the above 
agreements and associated arrangements for processing them. ]

Since I am retiring on June 30, 2000, I have no territorial interest in what 
happens but I think I would be remiss if I didn't at least offer a couple of 
comments: 

1.  Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some 
has been effective.  It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an 
agreement.  This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which 
vendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which 
we treat different vendors.  I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide 
and conquer approach. 

2.  The agreements need to be updated.  I know that there are some reasons 
for using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR 
PROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could 
be worked out.  It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is 
some duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., 
all things that could be fixed rather easily. 

3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover 
all kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.

4.  If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an 
arrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement 
but the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for 
anything that they might do on the PWD. 

I realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what 
it is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view 
it with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking 
a methodology that has served us.

Thanks.  gene

you my comments on response to Malme's motion to extend time to designate

Pat, thanks for the revisions to the AESOP language.  I have another one for 
you.  The attached is a proposed retention program for persons in HR who may 
be facing outsourcing.  There is a need to incentivize these key personnel to 
stick around now and, if there is an outsourcing, to help with the 
transition.  Your comments/thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle and Brian,

Please review the attached draft memo for distribution to employees to 
communicate the project completion program.  We would present each employee 
with an individualized memo showing their award amount and the terms.  The 
department head would be responsible for filling in the project term.  Let me 
know what changes need to be made to the memo before we use it.  They would 
like to communicate to their folks as soon as possible.



Also, please look over the revised presentation for the project completion 
incentive for the final time - no significant changes have been made.



Thanks,
Kim

I'd like to wait until we get legal opinion first.  Once we know there are no 
DOL/ERISA issues (or at least some we can manage), we can set-out the process 
flow and then the companies.  I'll coordinate a conference call -- but let's 
do this after the holidays.  So many of the players are not here at the same 
time and I am sure payroll has as many year end issues as we do right now.

(Sheri, please contact Michelle Cash and Pat Mackin to get available dates 
and then set-up a conference call including the above people as well as Mikie 
Rath and Dolores Lenfest.  We probably need to do this as soon as possible in 
the new year.  Can you also include Jane Pleli, Joann Hill and Sherry 
Lessner, there may be issues with us changing current environment prior to 
7/1/2000 that we need to consider.)

Subject: Re: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals  

For the employees to be provided with domestic benefits, they could just be 
placed on the standard domestic payroll, whereas the employees not to have 
domestic benefits could be on the new company.  As Cynthia states below, the 
new company (as a whole) would not be adopting benefit plans.  Logistically, 
there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires 
on the correct company.

Also, the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once SAP 
Payroll comes online 7/1.  Currently, there is some manual intervention when 
charging from one company (like Expat Services) to the appropriate accounting 
company.

The not making them eligible for domestic benefits is easy.  The new payroll 
company will simply not adopt the plans.  I am assuming that the number of 
employees (nor associated demographics) in this company will not create a 
discrimination problem.    

One question though, will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you 
want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not.  If 
the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps.

Let me know if we can help.

Subject: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals

As Enron expands globally, we are faced with a growing issue of more and more 
foreign nationals entering the US on varied lengths of assignment.  For some, 
it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain 
retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash 
balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the 
fact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on 
their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method 
to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well 
as receive US $.

Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a 
portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is 
paid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No 
FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.  
Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as 
they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, 
health/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment 
agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.

I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be 
possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign 
nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a 
mechanism to:

receive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account
pay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare
not make them eligible for domestic benefits

I would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.

David, on point 2, that type of arrangement has to be approved by the Enron 
Executive Committee.  Let me know if you want a copy of the note describing 
that process, which was sent by Cindy Olson a few weeks ago.    Michelle

Spoke with him about his contract on Monday. We agreed following changes and 
he would sign;

1 - Should read Michael L Brown throughout
2 - He would us to have Mark F send him a note (separately) that says why we 
will rank him as a VP he can continue to use the MD title externally and 
maintain any related travel perq's associated with that.
3 - We should change cash sign-on to 12 months pay back.


 Can you get him final asap. Also Kim/Mel lets draft email for Mark F.

Subject: Agreements with non-employee contractors



Michelle,

While I think that "Enron" discourages entering into agreements for services
directly with non-employee contractors, there are times when a business
decision is made to do so on a very limited basis.  Aside from other legal
issues, one single issue that has received a lot of attention in recent years
is the issue addressed by the Microsoft case involving the question under
what circumstances are individuals designated as independent contractors
entitled to employee benefits provided by  an employer to its employees.

While we have amended the various employee benefit plans to address this
issue, another place where it can be effectively addressed is in the contract
for services.

Recently, I was involved with a project to develop provisions to be included
in such a service agreement with non-employee contractors who will not be
entitled to employee benefits.  I thought you might have an interest in this,
so I have attached the contract provisions that were developed for this
circumstance along with an analysis.

I wonder if there are other attorneys who design and draft such agreements
who would be interested in receiving this information?

Regards,

Pat

Drew,

Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who 
has had some issues.  I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his 
agreement.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you 
fax it to my house first thing in the morning?  713-218-7355 is the fax 
number.  If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to 
review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I 
will prepare on this topic.  I am going to be attending a seminar out of the 
office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.

I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and 
Louise for comment and dart-throwing.  I can be reached via my cell phone 
during the day at 713-302-5522.

Thanks, Drew.

Debi,

Your plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching 
this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.

My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting 
resumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to 
interview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling 
them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially 
since their "proven track record" is only for one placement.  It does not 
appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption 
is not correct.

Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is 
well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of 
admission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .

Thanks.

Michelle

Subject: Contracting Solutions

Our research is complete with John Nguyen and Mark Delaro.    There is only 
one John Nguyen that works for Enron, and he is at EBS.   This is not the 
same John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions.  I talked with the 
Enron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John.    The 
John Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5/4 to Keith Dziadek for an 
opening he had.   We got no response from Keith, which for him is considered 
a no.    We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS.    He was 
directly recruited by Ergos, presented by them, and hired through them.   
Jennifer talked with Mark  and he states that he has never talked to a 
recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions.   If CS did indeed present his 
resume to Enron, then they should be able to produce the email with date/time 
stamp.    Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet.   I feel Robert and 
I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation.   Robert 
had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I 
think we should make good on the promise.

Here are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.

1)  I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone.
2)  Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John 
Nguyen, based on above facts.
3)  Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.  
The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list, and CS 
is not on it since no one is interested in working with them.   We should let 
them know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract 
placement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.    We 
accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with 
recruiting.    We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give 
them a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well 
defined.  They should contact me directly at that time.
4)  We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the 
difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them, 
Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been 
made, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in 
order to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer's 
decision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)  inadequate resume flow  2) 
poor working relationship with account manager.
5)  We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other 
company including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after 
addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.   Nor did 
she did send Mark Delaro's resume to Ergos.  We have no reason to believe 
that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron, nor that 
she will in the future.
6) Cheryl Charles (Maddison) presented her resume to Robert and Ryan, and 
Ryan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks, and has not claimed association 
with CS.   We have no recruiter openings at this time, and she has been 
informed of this by Ryan and myself.

Jeff, Good luck with the EES rotation.  I would like to clarify one thing:  
at this point, I don't know for sure if we are having law students work with 
us during the summer.  Why don't you check with me in April or May to see 
whether we are hiring summer associates.  If so, you are welcome to go 
through the interview process.  Thanks.  Michelle

Thanks for speaking with me yesterday.  I'm leaning toward accepting a 
position at EES, which is the business unit that I believe offers the best 
fit with my background.  Let's plan on speaking again in a few months, 
because I would enjoy devoting the summer to your group.  I can probably 
bounce from EES to Legal, then back to EES to finish out the Associate 
program.  If possible, pencil me in.

I'm close to the point when I need to accept an offer.  Adding value to the 
legal function would be my first choice.  Is this still a possibility?  
Please let me know if I can provide any additional information, or if you 
would like to meet.  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but will return on 
Friday.

By the way, I recognize that our legal group doesn't have training and 
development resources like those devoted to new Associates in law firms.  
That's not what I'm looking for, and it doesn't apply to me at my age and 
experience-level.  My proposition is to use primarily my non-legal 
intellectual capital to add value to your group, and only secondarily the 
legal intellectual capital, which I'm still developing, and which will 
improve through osmosis if I'm in your group.

Thanks,

Jeff

To confirm my voicemail, my current rotation ends December 31.  I'm 
interested in a six-month rotation in the legal department beginning January 
2.  I completed 46 hours at the University at Buffalo Law School, before my 
teaching contract expired and the Enron opportunity arose.  The ABA allows 30 
credits to be transferred between law schools, so I began at South Texas 
College of Law with 30 credits, and will complete nine credits this 
semester.  A total of ninety are required.

My schedule tomorrow afternoon and late morning is open.  If you can schedule 
time to meet, I'd appreciate the opportunity.

Jeff

The CFO of Power Systems Manufacturing is  Wayne Garrett.

John Howton is forwarding your e:mail to Wayne's attention to review and 
answer questions.  Wayne and I both feel that this is a clean transfer of 
employees.  The story is as follows:

1.  They are payroll by ADP in Fort Lauderdale.  The representative is Sonia 
Vassell (954) 717-6975.  The code that they are currently using is PXU for 
processing payroll.  These employees are paid bi-weekly.

2.   Benefits = Health, Dental and Life in which Wayne does not have a 
problem with continuing to pay their benefits until the end of the year.  
This will allow us approximately 1 1/2 months to set the AMPS company up 
(effective 1/1/2001).

3.  Vacation is 15 days which include sick and vacation.  Wayne company will 
pay any accrued vacation given us a chance to determine how we want to 
structure vacation effective 1/1/2001.

4. 401K is administered by Fidelity.  There is not a company match.  So, we 
can figure out how  to handle 401k going forward.

5.  Disburse Power is the holding company that Wayne has set up to hold these 
employees until AMPS is established.

I asked John Howton who is responsible for getting the joint venture company 
"AMPS" set up and he will call me back with that answer.  Maybe you know the 
answer.

It seems to me that this is a clean set up.  We need to determine how we want 
to process their payroll, how to handle benefits and which policies we want 
to put in place for these employees.  John has a spreadsheet with employee 
information that he will forward to our attention. 

I know you will have more detailed questions and we will need to funnel 
everything through John Howton.

Let's schedule a time to discuss in more detail tomorrow.

Tara,

You are right -- those changes were not included.  For Vice President level 
employees, corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses.  

The request that he be able to "get out" of his employment contract if he is 
not promoted also is not something that we can do; otherwise, it will 
undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board.

 I spoke with David Oxley on both of those points, and he concurred that 
these changes could not be made.

2)Danny McCarty wanted guaranteed bonus for 2000 rather than performance

Kay, 10/10 works for me at 4:00.  If that date doesn't work, would you please 
include my assistant, Twanda Sweet, on the distribution, given that I will be

I notice my calender doesn't yet seem to have this meeting scheduled. I will 
ask Kay Chapman (since Rhonna has now deserted me!) to help put a time 
together. Drew/Mary, FYI sorry I didn't get a chance to send you this before. 
Let me know if you want to attend, happy to have you there.

Gerry, can you help me put an agenda together so that everyone knows what we 
are looking to achieve here. In broad terms I am looking to do the following:

Update all on project we set HR Associate group and their recommendations
Discuss their recommendations and look at any refinements or ideas we think 
we should also incorporate (see my thumb nail sketch notes inspired by 
Associate group below).
Reaffirm commitment to take this project forward and agree:
Team for doing so
Resources and timimg
Methodology for agreeing final version.
My ambition is that we (but in particular Andrea, Bob, Gerry, Tim, Tana, Dan, 
Neil, myself and possibly Suzanne if she can given the work she had already 
done in this area) all agree to contribute to this and get it done without 
the need for a formation of a new team or group. Obviously everyone welcome 
to participate.

Tana/Dan,

Can you cicruclate a summary of your teams proposals to this group so we they 
can review before meeting. Could you also agree within your team who you 
would like to attend this meeting (I would suggest 2 or 3 of you attend 
rather than all).

Thanks




David

Rhonna,

Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this 
message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will 
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).

The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps 
required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the 
development of an HR "value index" at Enron.

I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.

David

Michelle,

As most Engineering Contractors are beginning to staff up, it is prudent for 
us to have more than one Professional Services Agreements in place for the 
VLNG Front End Engineering Design effort.  Another Company that I have delt 
with in the past, and which also provided assistance to Enron on the Dabhol 
Power Project, is Paragon Engineering Services, Inc.  As requested for 
Technip USA in my e-mail of 5 Dec, please begin negotiations with Paragon 
Engineering Services for a Professional Services Agreement, to be in place in 
the Feb/March timeframe.  The contact person at Paragon is:

Michelle,

Following up on our meeting last week, we need to get a Professional Services 
Agreement in place with Technip USA Corp.  We do not anticipate a need for 
utilizing their resources until Feb/March at the soonest, but as these 
agreements sometimes take a while to negotiate, I believe it appropriate to 
start this one soon.  The contact person at Technip USA is:

 Gerald W. Alves, P.E.

 Phone: 713 548 4263

 Email:  jalves@Technip.com

As discussed, we need a general type Professional Services Agreement so that 
we can draw upon any of their resources at previously established rates, on 
an as required basis.  

Please let me know how we should proceed with getting this agreement in place,

Regards
James

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail to you, I would like to use 
contractors from the two firms listed below.  Both of these firms have 
contractors available now, so as soon as we get these agreements in place we 
can bring them in and put them to work.  If possible, I'd like any agreement 
we put in place to be flexible enough to allow us to use other contractors in 
the future besides those we currently have identified.  If you need me to do 
anything else or if you are not the right person to talk to, please let me 
know.  Thanks.

As discussed.

1)Text from B&M document on labour law relating to contract duration states

Quote

The term of an employment contract can be indefinite. However, if an 
employment agreement provides for a definite term, such term may not exceed:

a) one year, or

b) 3 years in regard to agreements with any of the following types of 
employee:

 i) a new employee with special expertise, techniquew or experience 
designated by the MOL which is necessary for research or developement of new 
products, new services, or new technologies;

 ii).a new employee with special expertise, techniquew or experience 
designated by the MOL which is necessary for services that are rendered to 
efffect start-up, change, expansion, scale down or discontinuation of a 
business and that are expected to be completed within a specific period..

Unquote

I seek clarification as to whether we can obtain MOL approval that our senior 
Japanese (say Director level) staff can be categorized under b). Thanks for 
your assistance

Walt:

Per our conversation this afternoon, you have accepted the PRC Historical 
Information and Historical Bonus Information as your project.  These are 
separate activity sets which are closely related.  We have "joined" these 
activity set due to commonality of the PRC and Bonus with Enron, and to 
ensure that you have an adequate workload for your project period.  

As part of this project initialization, you need to:

Determine the Objectives (set with Kathy Schultea, any other individual(s) 
she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and Bob Sparger)
List Activities/Tasks
Set Timelines with Key Dates
Set Deliverables and Targets
Establish Status Reporting

The primary focus is on the  PRC Historical Information set.  It is very 
important that you determine the data sources early on in your project to see 
how you might run all activities in parallel.  If this is not possible, you 
will need to communicate what the issues may be.

The first step is to schedule a meeting with Kathy Schultea, any other 
individual(s) she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and me 
to go through the list above and begin to setup the various components to 
meet the needs of the future staffing teams in the BUs. 

As part of our toolkit, Project Status Report sheets follow.



We need to setup the project status reporting ASAP. 

Upon completion of the project initialization steps, we will meet to discuss 
the performance evaluation process for your project.  Your evaluation will be 
based on several criteria related to the project and your individual 
performance.  Key items that are part of this process include:

Handling of the project initialization stage (includes project planning and 
setup);
Overall quality of the project deliverables (includes work products and 
documentation accuracy and clarity);
The quantity of the overall project work effort (based on volume of the 
effort targeted and completion);
Project management and communication (based on timeliness, accuracy, and 
communication);
Feedback from the project customer base (based on teaming, communication, 
responsiveness, and initiative); and
Other criteria (to be agreed, as appropriate).

The vehicle for evaluation will be the standard PEP form and criteria as used 
in the PRC process.  The items listed above are measurable against the 
specific skills/behaviors that Enron uses in performance evaluation.  
Following are the forms and criteria which will be used in the evaluation 
process.


If you have any questions or concerns, please call me at ext. 31858.

Regards,

Bob

Michelle, 
As regards yesterday's meeting on PRC descriptors, I understood that we were 
going to move from the "Strong" through "Needs Improvement"  categories  to 
numbers 1-5 (or 1-6 if we decide not to combine the last two categories), and 
that we were going to assign relative descriptors to the new number 
categories.  My task is to come up with some good verbiage for the 
descriptors.  

I'd like to chat with Dick, if this is possible, for his additional input as 
I go along with this.  Does he have a phone number in Enron or an email 
address at which I may reach him. 

I am leaving for a mini-vacation to Cape Cod tonight --will be back on 
Monday.  But intend to work on this over the weekend so that I have something 
in hand early next week for us to discuss.  Does this work for you? 

Many thanks in advance, 

Gina

 I received a call from Gene Diers today about what he believes may be going 
on with changes to my Agreement for Project Services ("APS") and how we 
operate.  There are business and legal reasons for the APS  being in the name 
of Enron Corp.  If we sell a company and the APS was in the name of a 
subsidiary, we would have to get the sold subsidiary to license the computer 
software to us.  Given the inability to determine this at the time everyone 
is pushing to sell the subsidiary, we could end up without any software or 
having to pay a substantial amount of money to the buyer later on when we 
discover the mistake.  Secondly, allowing all subsidiaries to negotiate 
different versions with vendors would be a nightmare and create five times 
the number of agreements to file.  I am opposed to this.  Every time we sell 
a company, the software has always been an issue.  We are as I told you 
before trying to fix something that is not broken.

		 Subject: Employment Agreement Guidelines


Effective May 8, the guidelines outlined in our April 14th training session 
will be officially implemented.  This means that employment agreements for 
VPs and above are not to be generated unless you have received a completed 
and approved request form.  Each business unit should call Mary McKendree 
(713-345-8085)  for the form and we will fax or hand deliver it to them.  The 
form must  be signed by the appropriate HR personnel for the business unit 
(names to be provided to Mary McKendree by each business unit) and then 
returned to Mary McKendree.  The form will be initialed by someone in 
Executive Compensation (Mary McKendree, Mary Joyce, or Pam Butler) and 
delivered to you for generating drafts.  Please do not distribute a draft to 
anyone without a signed and initialed request form.

Also, as discussed, requests for signing bonuses, retention bonuses, up-front 
grants by number of options rather than value, and guaranteed LTI awards are 
exceptions to the rules that the business units will need to justify before 
they will be approved.  Please do not make changes to these items or add any 
provisions to the standard short form without contacting Executive 
Compensation.

These procedures have been implemented at the request of the Office of the 
Chairman.  Consistent application of compensation standards and attention to 
the One Enron goal are key to our success.

Please pass this memo on to others who are impacted by this implementation.  
Sheila, would you please ensure that all Compensation Staff receive this?

Please note the counter settlement offer set forth in the email below by our

I recommend that we settle the matter for $7,500 or a little less if we can 
get there.

I think it is your Company's money so I will defer to you on this one.

Hi Kriste,
As we discussed, I offered Gignilliat a $5,000 nuisance value settlement.
Gignilliant's counsel, after consulting with his client, said he would take
$7,500 to settle the case.  While I think Enron has a very strong defense to
the disability claim, I am less certain about the aiding and abetting claim.
As we discussed, the Mass. Commission Against Discrimination allowed
Gignilliat to amend his charge to add this claim.  Gignilliat may be able to
create enough of a fact contest about what the plant manager (Dennis
Sherrin) told ANP  about his disability to at least get past the probable
cause stage.  While I still think that in the end, Enron has a very good
chance of prevailing on the aiding and abetting claim, $7,500 is a good,
final resolution to avoid further litigation.  Let me know what you think.
Thanks,

This is Scott Williamson's reponses. I talked with him about the number of 
times he travels out of the US for work and he said for Enron he has and will 
not travel for work. For Conchango he does. Right now he is in the UK trying

Discrimination Suit 
Filed by Microsoft Salaried Employee
Alleges Discrimination Based on Race, Sex 



SEATTLE--A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp. alleging the company 
maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African 
American and female salaried employees, affecting pay rates and promotion 
opportunities (Donaldson v. Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C00-1684P, 
10/4/00). 
Such discrimination at the company "is the standard operating procedure," the 
lawsuit said. 

The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job 
benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 
400 African American employees and some 4,500 female employees. 

Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate 
discrimination of any kind. 

"We take these kinds of issues very seriously," Murray said regarding the 
lawsuit. The company has an "active diversity policy" and seeks to recruit 
and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could 
not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. 

The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who 
worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former 
African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 
4, 1998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint 
said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 
percent are women. 

Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 
21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft 
employees are women and 22.2 percent minorities, he said. 

The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll of Seattle. The 
named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of 
all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female 
salaried employees at Microsoft. 

"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely 
subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting 
the terms and conditions of their employment" at the company, the complaint 
said. The violations--of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil 
Rights Act of 1991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871--are "systemic in nature, 
and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's 
operations," the lawsuit maintains. 


'Excessive Subjectivity' Alleged

The complaint said the company allows "excessive subjectivity" in decisions 
involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against 
employees in the class who complained "either internally or externally about 
Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving 
unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating 
them."
 
The lawsuit said the company "uses an excessively subjective evaluation 
system" that allows managers "who are predominantly white males, to rate 
employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit." 
Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scale, but scores of 
five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the 
company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each 
score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. 

"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a 
certain number of them must still receive the lower scores." Any employee 
with a 2.5 score is placed on a "personal improvement plan" or asked to 
resign, the complaint said. 

"Stack rankings" are used to rank employees in the same job category and 
organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be 
ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically 
higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. 

"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal 
popularity with other managers" because the rankings mix employees working 
for different managers. 

In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company 
also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries 
"substantially lower" than those paid white males doing similar work, with 
the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit 
said. 

Furthermore, "excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria" are applied in 
promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African 
Americans and female employees.

Hi Michelle.  I am so sorry that i was unable to chat with you at last week's 
meeting with David.  I have a question regarding photos on the MD/VP 
biographic profiles (which will be provided at the VP/MD Global meetings on 
31 July and 1 Aug. 

 I am told that insofar as possible we should ensure photos are included on 
all the bio profiles-- but I also understand that there are legal 
considerations (i.e. we need to get employee concurrence to include the 
pictures).

I gather that there is a disclaimer or consent form that the VP's and MD's 
will have to sign and wondered if you would have a copy of this consent form 
for me to use.  
Any info you can provide on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in 
advance.

 Gina

JoAnn,

I left you a voice mail responding to your voice mail containing these 
questions.  I wonder why you didn't get it?  Anyway, the responses are as 
follows:

1.  Thanks for getting it typed into the system.  I look forward to reviewing 
the document.  (I guess that explains why we couldn't find it in our system!!)
2.  New title is fine.  In fact, I am thinking that we should have anyone who 
works in HR sign off on this agreement.  What do you think?  That is the 
plan.  What I'd like to do is take this to the HR Council and have them 
assign a point person in each of their business units to coordinate getting 
this done for the current HR staff, in addition to all future additions to HR.
3.  It should go in PH file, with a copy to me for my files. This will be 
incorporated into the "Procedures".
4.  I have prepared a contractor agreement, which Derek Anderson has.  If you 
need a copy, let me know.  Yes I'd like this copy.  With so many contractors 
working in HR, I believe we need to also include them in this exercise.  
Please forward a copy and I'll include in the process.

Thanks. 

Michelle

Subject: HR Confidentiality Agreement

Michelle -- per my voice message I left the other day, there are still a few 
outstanding questions I need your feedback on relative to the subject 
document.

I have a hardcopy version which does not indicate a document number.  I am 
having our assistant put this into an electronic version and will forward to 
you for final signoff.
I have retitled the agreement from "Confidentiality Agreement" to "Human 
Resources Information Confidentiality Agreement".
When signed, where do you suggest the signed document be filed -- employees' 
Personnel History (PH) file?
The document is an agreement only between an "employee" and Enron.  What 
about all of the contractors working in HR?  Will they be required to sign a 
similar agreement or should this be covered in the master agreement with the 
vendor and/or individual consultant?

Thanks for your response.
Jo Ann

Attached is my preliminary report based on the information in the data room.

There was not near enough information in the data room, and for the second
time, there was no one from the Seller present at the data room who we could
ask questions of.

There are a couple of areas of concern.  There is still a lot of data to be
furnished.  Much of the documents in the data room was not allowed to be
copied.

I have instructed Paul Blundy, the  attorney contact for our Canadian counsel
to have documents sent to Rick.

Rick, as you receive data that involves benefits, please send it to Dee.

I provided a copy of our Q format to Roland, our Canadian labor counsel, to
format and revise as need to fit the Canadian companies being acquired.  He
seemed to be knowledgeable in labor relations, but will need actuarial help
(as will we) in reviewing the benefit accruals for defined benefit plans.

For the next two weeks, I will have my beeper and will check my phone
messages as I find telephones in the wilderness.

I also provided a hard copy of the attachment to the Enron deal guys before I
left Toronto.

I am aware that an agreement was contemplated.  I did not prepare one,

If we need to put one in place, it can be done rather easily.

Dear Michelle and Fran

I understand from my file and from speaking with Anita Fam that you were to 
have a Secondment Agreement for Mr JG Hong and Ms Kim JA put in place between 
Enron Overseas Services Corp ("EOSC" previously known as "OPC Ltd") and Enron 
Capital & Trade Resources Korea Corp. ("ECTRKC", a Delaware corporation). 
This dates back to on or about January 1999, but I don't have a copy of the 
executed Secondment Agreement on file. Please let me have a copy as we may 
potentially have to present a copy to the Korean tax authorities as evidence 
of Mr JG Hong and Ms Kim JA's employment/secondment structure.

There are some tax related issues that have arisen in Enron Korea that I'm 
assisting Lim Tiong Hock to resolve and your early response would be most 
appreciated.

Thanks and regards

Matt

Thanks for the draft.

Delaware is the proper state.

I thought the deferral information was sent to you already.   There is no 
"plan" document per se.  Instead, there is a description of the program.  I 
will re-send that to you today if you don't already have it.

Please contact my assistant, Twanda Sweet, for a time to have a conference

Michelle -

In the meeting we had last month regarding background investigation policies, 
we discussed the area on our current application where the candidate is asked 
to disclose convictions, etc.  In some instances, the candidate could 
truthfully disclose nothing, yet have a misdemeanor conviction for theft, 
possession, etc.  or other charges that would be potential disqualifiers for 
a position with Enron.  Since the question is poorly phrased, you had 
recommended that this piece be reworded, and you suggested that Ryan Seleznov 
bring it up in the Recruiting Council.  I brought this up to Ryan, but she 
felt that this would probably be more in the province of your area or Felicia 
Acevedo.  Would you like to take this task on, or would it be more 
appropriate to ask Felicia Acevedo to work on it?

Thanks.

Tara,

You are right -- those changes were not included.  For Vice President level 
employees, corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses.  

The request that he be able to "get out" of his employment contract if he is 
not promoted also is not something that we can do; otherwise, it will 
undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board.

 I spoke with David Oxley on both of those points, and he concurred that 
these changes could not be made.

2)Danny McCarty wanted guaranteed bonus for 2000 rather than performance

______________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________
Drew Lynch has asked that I coordinate a project to determine if we have 
employees in the correct companies (for U.S. companies) and do we know the 
ownership structure of both domestic and foreign companies.  We will approach 
this in three phases as below:

Phase I - On our payroll system - do we have employees in the correct 
companies in EPC and do we know which ones are wholly owned by Enron;

Phase II - Not on our payroll but in the U.S. -  do we know who the employees 
are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is structured;  

Phase III - Not on our payroll and outside the U.S. - do we know who the 
employees are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is 
  structured.

 I will have some preliminary work completed and would like to review it at 
that time.

All is fine -- no disparate impact in the selection.  But, I still would like 
to see data about why certain persons were selected.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle, 

Thank you very much for reviewing and returning the Termination Procedure 
that my group, ENA Competitive Analysis & Business Controls, has been working 
on.  Marissa Womble forwarded the edited procedure to me, and I will make the 
necessary changes to the document.  I truly appreciate your knowledge and 
legal expertise, especially in this matter.  Please note that Marissa Womble 
has rotated into a new group; therefore, please contact either Kristin Walsh 
(ext. 3-9510) or myself (ext. 3-9307) regarding any future policies and 
procedures.

Thank you,

Christa Winfrey

Enclosed is another draft of the proposed Agreement and Release.  It has 
incorporated some, but not all, of your changes.  It is my hope that this 
draft is the final one; if it is not, I believe that it would be most 
efficient for you to meet with me and David Oxley before the end of this 
week, as I will be out of the office next week.  

Please let me or David know if you have any questions or comments.

Killian Satel)


2000 EEO-1 Surveys Deadline Extended
September 25, 2000


The Joint Reporting Commission  of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) has extended the deadline for employers to file their
2000 EEO-1 Surveys from September 30, 2000 to October 30, 2000. Private
employers with 100 or more employees and federal contractors with 50 or
more employees and contracts of $50,000 or more, are required to file
an EEO-1 report.
The EEOC has recently completed its mail-out of EEO-1 forms, so keep checking
your mail - it should be on its way!  If October 15th rolls around and
you have not yet received your survey, you may call the Joint Reporting
Committee at (757) 461-1213, or log on to www.mimdms.com, to request a
copy.

If you would like more information on this issue, please contact Kelly
Killian Satel at (210) 299-3590 or 1-800-597-1166.

Roberto, If a person is accessing inappropriate web sites in the course of 
investigations, it does not violate the policies.  However, it may be useful 
to set up protocols or logs to confirm when a person is accessing it for 
investigative purposes to remove all confusion on the matter.  Michelle

This is to the best of my recollection from my daytimer, scheduler, and phone

Let me know if you need anything else.   Please keep me in the loop.
I'd like to know when Sally is briefed.

Attached is the Summary that Glenn Wright and I used as the basis for 
reviewing the Steam Purchase Agreement and the Lease today.  

Jay and Clark, please note that there are a couple of drafting follow up 
instructions contained in the Summary.

Glenn, please let me know if I misstated the resolution of any issues 
discussed.

David, there is at least one follow-up request in the Summary.

Finally, Michelle Cash, ENA's labor and employment attorney informed me that 
there are 23 employees currently involved in the operation of the 2 Cogentrix 
plants and that employee due diligence will take some time.  I am expecting 
to receive a checklist of employment related documentation shortly and will 
forward it on to you so that you can have Alamac obtain such information from 
Cogentrix as soon as possible.  Michelle would like to know what plans have 
been developed to date as to post-acquisition of the 2 plants.  In short, are 
we planning to offer all 23 of Cogentrix's employees jobs? 

Steve

Dear Michelle---Just a note to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you
today.  Thank you for taking time to learn more about my background and
experience and to share your Enron story with me.  I am very interested in
the available position because I welcome the opportunity to learn new things
and improve my skills.  Although I have not worked at a law firm, I am
fortunate to say that my in-house experience has been very hands-on with most
of the transactions and all of the labor matters handled without outside
counsel.  I discussed this point at some length with Elizabeth Sager and left
a reference list with Molly McGee in HR.  Looking forward to hearing from you
soon,

Alice Ginsburgh

Do you think these depositions will take a day apiece?  Or, can we schedule 
more than one in a day?  Let me know, so that I can arrange schedules.

Thanks for the update!  Good work.

Subject: Enron/continuance of trial date


Michelle,

 We had the pretrial hearing today before Judge Kaufman.  He granted
our Motion to continue the trial date.
The new date is February 20, 2001.  The next pretrial conference is
scheduled February 2, 2000, and all of the depositions must be completed by
that date.  I further informed the Judge that Enron would make George
McClellan, Tom McQuade, Mike Beyer, Dan Reck, and Andrea Frate Bennett
available in January, 2000.  He will hold Enron to this.

 Therefore, Please obtain dates for the depositions of George
McClellan, Dan Reck, and Tom McQuade, in Houston Texas during the month of
January 2001.  It is my understanding based on past correspondence between
you and Chuck Woody that the Enron Depositions in Houston will occur at
Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, 3400 Chase Tower, 600 Travis Street, Houston,
Texas 77002-3095.  Further, please do not schedule any of the depositions on
January 16th or 17th because the Plaintiff's counsel will be unavailable on
those days.

 Furthermore, please provide a deposition date for Mike Beyer in
Pittsburgh Pa. during the Month of January 2001.  Again,  the Plaintiff's
counsel will not be available the 16th and 17th of that month.

 Finally, please provide a date for Ms. Frate for January 2001 if
possible that is not on the 16th or 17th.

 I will provide Plaintiff's counsel with a notice of the availability
of Enron employees upon receipt of your response to this E-mail.

 Thanks

Kristina,  

Attached is the letter we give to all persons who terminate from ENA 
voluntarily (although I don't really know why we limit it to voluntary 
terminations -- I have to look into that).  I also will send you by messenger 
the draft letter to a company (which I don't have on the system) and the 
letter I sent to the individual we discussed.

I hope these help.  Let me know if you would like additional information.

This is what I want to send to Lucy, so we start the deletion process on our 
DAT tapes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lucy, It is Enron's Retention Policy that all audio tapes be destroyed that 
are older than six months.  This policy was lifted when the East Power 
Marketers had a brief inflation of electricity pricing during the summer 
months of 1998.  That retention policy is now back into affect and therefore, 
all audio tapes older than six months at the start of each month will be 
physically destroyed.

I understand that there is some litigation going on because of the price 
inflation during that time frame, so I need to know what time period we 
should keep until all litigations are completed.

Please respond back as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Darren Adamik

he would sign;

1 - Should read Michael L Brown throughout
2 - He would us to have Mark F send him a note (separately) that says why we 
will rank him as a VP he can continue to use the MD title externally and 
maintain any related travel perq's associated with that.
3 - We should change cash sign-on to 12 months pay back.


 Can you get him final asap. Also Kim/Mel lets draft email for Mark F.

Subject: Re: International Information - GIS  

Hi, Charla,

I have reviewed the additional fields you described.  Most of them look fine 
with me.  I do have some concerns with the questions about birthplace, 
citizenship, personal travel, and reason for return from prior assignment.  

The questions about birthplace/citizenship are the most risky.  As I have 
discussed with others, such questions could create issues of national origin 
discrimination, particularly if one's birthplace country is not evident from 
any other source.  It also could create a privacy issue if we are asking 
questions that are not job-related and consistent with business necessity.  
What is the purpose of this inquiry?  Are we trying to determine whether  a 
person is eligible to work in a particular country?  If so, it appears that 
birthplace and citizenship are not the answers that we need.  We already have 
a field on where a person is eligible to work, which would cover the 
situation where a person has citizenship in one country, but is on a work 
visa to another.   Any other information may not be necessary.

The question about reasons for returning from leave also could unearth 
information that we really don't want to keep on a system.  For example, if a 
person left because of health reasons, or the birth of a child . . . it 
really is not a job-related issue.  What is the purpose of this question?  Is 
there a less intrusive way to ask it?   

Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is 
asking information that is not job-related.  What is the purpose of that 
inquiry?  Is there another way to gather that information?

Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful -- some of them may be 
unwise for the reasons I cited above.  If you would like to discuss this 
further, please give me a call.

Michelle

Subject: Opportunities at ENA


Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

Sharon, Kriste, and I discussed this, and agreed that simple was better.  We 
also thought that a reference to the Enron Employee Data Protection Policy

If we need to establish an accept/decline box I'd recommend we build it so

Dear all, 

We are about to embark on opening up more Enron people data to the general 
Enron population (i.e. expertfinder).  I want to ensure the appropriate risks 
have been identified, documented and agreed upon by the Enron executive 
staff.  Michelle mentioned last week that we may want to consider putting 
some proprietary statement on our applications that house people data. 
Therefore, I would like to have an agreed upon statement that can be posted 
in our applications. 
Here's one to get you started.  I would like to have this finalized by 
Tuesday September 25th.  Thanks. ay

Michael:
 Please see message below in which Christopher Millard of Clifford Chance 
indicates that a project that CC is working on with Enron Europe may involve 
subscription to the Nextlaw subscription service.  Sharon Butcher and I are 
working on a project for Enron Corp. HR that requires research on data 
protection laws in the various countries in which Enron has employees.  It is 
likely that we will subscribe to Clifford Chance's Nextlaw service, a 
database of data protection legislation in various countries.  One of the 
advantages of Nextlaw is that it is a more cost-effective approach than 
engaging local counsel in each jurisdiction to provide the legal research, 
and subscribers are entitled to quarterly updates of the information on the 
database during the annual subscription period.  At the end of my message to 
Christopher, please see the list of countries that we need information 
about.  My guess is that any of the jurisdictions you need are covered.  If 
so, I would propose to Christopher that if (as I anticipate) Enron Corp. 
subscribes to Nextlaw for the project Sharon and I are working on, Enron 
Europe should be entitled to access and use the information for the other 
project Christopher references.  We certainly don't want Enron to pay for the 
subscription service twice! Please tell me which lawyer in your group I 
should include in discussions.  Thanks

Very good to hear from you after all this time. Enron's subscription to
NextLaw has indeed expired, though we are starting to do some data
protection work with Enron Europe and were planning to show them NextLaw
soon as we believe it would be very useful to them. In the meantime, I would
be pleased to talk with you and Sharon on Monday at 09.00 Houston time about
how we might assist you with your new project.

We have indeed expanded the coverage of our NextLaw service over the last
few months. Of the 29 jurisdictions you list below, 17 are now covered by
NextLaw. Don't quote me on this but, to my knowledge, of the remaining 12
only Columbia has a data protection law which is currently in force and
Canada has a new law which is not yet in force.

I am copying this to my colleague Ben Ebdon in our Clifford Chance Online
group in the hope that he will be able to join us on the call on Monday.

In the meantime, I hope you have a good weekend.

Best regards
Christopher

Christopher:
     You may remember me from our conversations about 18 months ago, which
resulted in Enron subscribing to Clifford Chance's Nextlaw subscription
service.  Enron's annual subscription lasped several months ago, but we are
in need of similar services again for a different HR project.  Enron senior
management has tasked the HR department with the creation of an internal
"expert directory" with which all Enron employees can identify other Enron
employees who have specific skills (such as language capabilities,
experience with particular kinds of projects, political contacts, etc.)
that may be useful for new intiatives.  As you can imagine, the data that
must be collected from all Enron employees worldwide is significantly more
complex than the information we were gathering from international employees
when we engaged your firm previously.  We would now like legal advice about
what consents must be obtained from employees in various foreign
jurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information, whether
certain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis (and
conversely, what information we can require that employees provide), etc.
[Please note that all information to be requested will be collected for
business purposes (our internal legal department has already informed HR
and management that certain information about personal interests, hobbies,
and non-professional memberships should not be collected or asked for.)]

     I am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke, your firm has added
additional jurisdictions to the subscription service, since many of the
countries in which we have employees were not on the database in early
1999.  I will list the jurisdictions that are relevant for this project at
the end of this message; however, in certain jurisdictions, Enron has only
a few employees, and we may elect not to include those employees in the
expert directory if we determine that the cost of the legal research for
that jurisdiction is not justified by the benefit to Enron.  I am also
wondering whether the information included in the database is sufficient
for this more complicated project.

     My colleague, Sharon Butcher, and I would like to discuss our new
project with you to see if Clifford Chance is again willing and able to
provide the local research that we require, and to get an estimate of the
cost involved.  We were hoping to call you at 9:00 am Houston time on
Monday, May 22nd.  Please let me know if this time is not convenient, and
we will arrange for another call.  I can be reached by telephone
(713-853-5698), fax (713-646-5847), or email (kelly.noel.higgason@enron).
I hope you are well, and look forward to our work together.

What happens to those people that are currently on Ecogas cobra when Ecogas
is no longer in existence? They have not utilized the 18 months that they
would be entitled to receive those benefits. Is Enron going to pick them up
like they did for the 10/13/00 layoff? Do we need to direct this question to
someone at Enron?

Mark,

As you requested, below is a list of my major accomplishments for the year.  

1. Resolution/management of pre-litigation and litigation matters, 
including:  Dwayne Hart/Utilicorp; Satterwhite; Barrington; Race/Statoil; 
Ross Malme; Rick Blandford; West Boettcher; Anita Suson; Charlie Weymms; 
Steven Cuneo; others.

2.  Efficient management of drafting, negotiating, revising, and completing 
several types of contracts in numerous different jurisdictions (e.g., almost 
200 employment agreements, 35 separation agreements, and 30 consulting 
services agreements).

3. Lead attorney on Project One (which involves issues surrounding the 
OFCCP's "glass ceiling" audit of ENA and all of Enron).

4. Labor and employment transactional support, including:  East Coast Power, 
Ecogas, CGas, Project Hurricane, Columbia, Project Grizzly, Las Vegas Cogen, 
and other acquisitions that involve the transfer or hiring of personnel. Many 
of these transactions require extensive legal support relating to personnel 
matters after closing.

5. Legal support on labor (union) matters, including successful closing of 
project labor agreements for the construction of generation assets (e.g., 
Pittsburg, 2000 peakers, Pastoria), Unfair Labor Practice matters, training 
on union-related issues in M&A's.

Let me know if you need any more information, and thanks for your support!

Michelle

Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I 
ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that 
the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon 
we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be 
replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.

To All -

We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2:30 in EB38C2.  I am hoping to 
have a test version of the site available - especially since it is due for 
release on Friday.  I have not been able to confirm its availability at this 
time.  If it is not available, there is probably not a reason to meet 
tomorrow as I am sure we all have other projects.

I will let you all know what the status is by late today or early a.m. 
tomorrow.

Monday.  Sorry about not letting you know where this was . . . .

Subject: Upgrades on night shifts with overtime

Diane,

I.  We need help with the following:

1) Employee works night shift  (12 SH2)
     Same employee is on an upgrade (12 UPG)
     Same employee works overtime

What would the overtime entry look like, and what would be the rate 
computation for the above employee?  

Assumptions:

A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour
SH2   $1/hr
UO1 $350  $   5.40/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
UPG $350  $   2.19/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)


  W F S S

REG   12 12 12
SH2  N N N N
UPG  12 12 12 12 
USO  12
UO1  12  

It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).

The UO1 would be calculated at $64.80 (5.40x12).

Second example for this scenario:

A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour
SH2   $1/hr
UO1 $350  $   5.40/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
UPG $350  $   2.19/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)


  W F S S

REG   12 12 12
SH2  N N N N 
UPG  12 12 
USO  12    2
UO1  12       

It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).

The UO1 would be calculated at $64.80 (5.40x12).

The USO would be calculated at $76.59 (25.53x1.5x2 hours)



2)  Employee works night shift
      Same employee works overtime

     Does the overtime rate take shift differential into account?

     We've got timesheets that show an employee who worked on a night shift 
for 12 hours.  This was the employee's off day.

     The code was 12 SH2 (for night shift)
                                   12 USO (for overtime)

      Are these time entries correct? Yes.  What would be the rate 
computation for the above employee?


The overtime would need to account for the shift differential.  For the week 
in question Jan 17-23 he has the following hours:

  W F S S

REG   12 12 12 
SH2  N N N N 
USO  12 
                                     
This ees salary is as follows:

A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour

It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).

Ted Bland is the Enron wholesale person responsible for all recruiting for 
one of the business units I support.

I actually spoke with Ted today about you.  He is working on scheduling you 
for a meeting, but he has had some difficulty in finalizing schedules.  So, 
there is no need to follow up, because he will get with you in a few days.

Hope all is well.

		 Subject: Re: CALME JV & Consultants

Dear Michelle:  I agree with you and Kriste.  I thought we put this issue to 
bed several years ago.  Consultants and Contractors are to be reviewed, if at 
all, by their respective employers.  If the Consultant and/or Contractor is 
not an employee of a third party employer, then Enron has the right to 
determine if they are meeting the terms and provisions of their contract.  
However, this does not mean they are to be included in the PEP and PRC 
process. 

To include them opens too many doors with respect to the proper 
classification of these individuals.  If we treat them like employees, we may 
find that a court determines they should be employees and thus eligible for 
all employee benefits, a la MicroSoft.  

Thanks.  Sharon

I agree with your recommendation Michelle that consultants and contractors 
should not participate in the PRC or the PEP process.  If  you treat 
consultants and contractors like "employees", they will soon become them in 
the eyes of the law, along with all of the costs, bonuses, and benefits.

Privileged and Confidential -- Advice Covered by the Attorney-Client Privilege

K2: 

I have copied this email to Sharon & Kriste, who are supporting the CALME 
region.  My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because 
their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be 
employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee 
compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).  This exposure could be high.  
Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating 
them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

David, 

I've been forwarded a voicemail on Friday from David Haug where he has 
requested that we include CALME's JV employees and Consultants who are at the 
VP level. (He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).  
Monica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only 
AIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David's 
instance I'm reverting to you for a decision. 

Although I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV's - my concern is 
primarily with the Consultants.

Below are my concerns in accommodating this request:-

- The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has 
finished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the 
system message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In 
this instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie's team to 
communicate to all reviewers of the JV's that they are required to give 
feedback.

- The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees 
in order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to 
describe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality 
issues and I want us to be aware of what we're doing regarding this.

Call me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail,

I agree with Brian.  I recently learned that someone can "hack" into the 
emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling (as I discussed with you, Brian, 
this morning).  So, we probably should start with that group to see if there 
are any gaps in the email system.  

I would suggest that someone from Net Works -- Roberto DeLeon or his crew-- 
would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor.  I agree with 
Brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the 
chairman and not the content of the email itself.

I am happy to assist in any way you would like.

 I am less concerned about the substantive comments of the message as I am 
about the "forgery" of the ECT OTC mailbox.  Unless Michelle or another 
opines differently, I believe it is incumbent upon us to determine who 
mis-used that e-mail address.  This is not to say that an employee should be 
disciplined for raising complaints; obviously that would be retaliatory in 
nature.  And so, if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or 
old-fashioned letter with OTC, I would have no issue.  But, here, this person 
has sent a communication ostensibly from ECT's OTC and apparently has access 
to do so in the future.  In my mind, that activity must be addressed and 
ceased.

 I suspect that it is technologically feasible to determine the source of the 
message.  Unless there is objection, I would recommend an investigation 
(which my group can do) to determine the author.

Subject: Performance Review Process

After having lived through another PRC process, it has become exceedingly 
obvious that there are several issues that need improvement in the process.  
With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now 
communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to 
other parties without change.

1)  Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the 
upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period, 
not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already 
occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such 
review period.  This is only fair to our employees so that they know the 
criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.

2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are 
willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without 
a bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within 
the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and 
it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be 
an unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward 
feedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input 
to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I 
have worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this 
process?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.  
How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with 
individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?

3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the 
process.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute 
minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the 
job function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to 
provide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that 
partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was 
not even asked for input.

4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our 
PRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR 
representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neither 
one of the definitions describes such performance as "simply doing the job".  
Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not 
effectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRC 
is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to 
pull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions and 
communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will 
give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be 
lacking.

Thanks for your listening ear.

Michelle,

The new program still needs final approval by the Enron Corp. board of
directors.  The design was tentatively approved last month, subject to final
review.  The following revised provision should serve you well in the
meantime:



All-Employee Stock Option Program

Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time
regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through
the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made
under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The
grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or
a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  Subject to final approval by the
Enron Corp. board of directors, a one time award of non-qualified stock
options under a replacement program is proposed to be made to eligible
employees as of December 29, 2000, in value equal to 25% of annual base
salary (5% of annual base salary for a 5-year period; salary valuation and
value may vary in some international locations).  Program awards are subject
to and effective upon the approval by the Compensation and Management
Development Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock
awards will be made pursuant to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as
determined by the Committee.  The exercise price for grants of stock options
will be determined according to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which
the award is granted.  The program may or may not be offered in certain
domestic and international locations based upon management discretion and/or
local labor and employment laws.

Felicia,

In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before 
someone can be classified as exempt.  However, because there are certain 
exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not 
have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to 
whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.

My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by 
these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If 
they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them 
affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the 
overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the 
overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not 
be an issue.

Let me know if you have questions.

Michelle

Subject: Part-time exempt employees

Sharon and Michelle,

We have 29 employees in the payroll system that are part-time exempt 
employees and their pay is calculated on an hourly rate.  Unless I understand 
the FLSA incorrectly we cannot in any way calculate salaries on exempt 
employees on an hourly basis.  If they are reduced hours we would need to 
determine how we would value their job based on a salary basis otherwise we 
are treating them as hourly employees and not exempt employees.   An exempt 
employee should only be tracking exception time (i.e. sick, vacation, etc -- 
any off duty time) but not work hours during the day.   An exempt worker 
according the FLSA can only be paid on a fee basis or salary basis -- not on 
an hourly basis.  If I am off base let me know, otherwise I would like your 
help with how we should approach getting this corrected and possibly having 
this covered in a policy on how to deal with employees performing exempt jobs 
that are working part-time or reduced schedules. 

Look forward to hearing back from you.

Felecia

Basically, RD wants to hire someone and have that person make a one-year

of agreement, I have recommended to RD that we either do a signing payment

Are you comfortable with that?

Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the 
end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.  We also hire 
consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is 
pretty long for a consultng position.  What is the situation?  Maybe we can 
find an alternative.

Debi,

I will defer to your expertise on whether we should actively accept resumes 
from CS at this time.  I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to 
receive them at this time, but that they are free to check with us in a 
couple of months to see whether that has changed.  That way, we aren't making 
it an absolute ban.

Thanks for the information.

Michelle

Subject: Re: Contracting Solutions  

Thanks for your feedback.   If we accept resumes from an agency it means 
establishing a full working relationship with them which is time consuming 
for the recruiter.  We have to constantly QA them and answer their phone 
calls, and it is more work than it seems from the outside.   They almost need 
to be coached all the time unless they are really good, which is rare.    CS 
is one of the fairly high maintenance agencies.   This is why we are going to 
a preferred vendor list.    We have lots of agencies that want to work with 
us, and choosing those that we can count on to get us good candidates 
quickly, and take the least amount of our time saves a lot of time for the 
recruiters.   After Jennifer told Kathyrn she wasn't going to work with her, 
Kathyrn did flood her inbox with unsolicited resumes.   That would certainly 
make me not want to work with them.   I can force the issue and ask one of 
the recruiters to work with them if you feel we need to, however I feel that 
until Kathryn cools off a little, this would not be productive.    As for the 
apology, I will always apologize if I am clearly in the wrong, however, I 
think that definitely in this case it would be construed as an admission of 
wrongdoing on Enron's part.   I'm fine with letting go of it.   This has been 
a good learning experience for me.    There have been a couple of phone calls 
this week where I was consciously more polite with agency/sales phone calls 
than I would have been prior to last week.    Jennifer had some fear up 
yesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue, 
which is understandable, and we're working through it together.  I want her 
to be able to stay in her power with these people, and we just need to learn 
new ways to do that.   It's a tough job dealing with agencies day after day - 
really wears you down.    We're going to write some scripts for talking with 
them in the future, and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me 
so they all get the same story.    We're also putting some new processes in 
place so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies.    
Hopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future.   
Thanks for all your help......

Debi,

Your plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching 
this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.

My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting 
resumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to 
interview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling 
them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially 
since their "proven track record" is only for one placement.  It does not 
appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption 
is not correct.

Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is 
well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of 
admission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .

Thanks.

Michelle

Subject: Contracting Solutions

Our research is complete with John Nguyen and Mark Delaro.    There is only 
one John Nguyen that works for Enron, and he is at EBS.   This is not the 
same John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions.  I talked with the 
Enron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John.    The 
John Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5/4 to Keith Dziadek for an 
opening he had.   We got no response from Keith, which for him is considered 
a no.    We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS.    He was 
directly recruited by Ergos, presented by them, and hired through them.   
Jennifer talked with Mark  and he states that he has never talked to a 
recruiting firm named Contracting Solutions.   If CS did indeed present his 
resume to Enron, then they should be able to produce the email with date/time 
stamp.    Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet.   I feel Robert and 
I should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation.   Robert 
had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I 
think we should make good on the promise.

Here are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.

1)  I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone.
2)  Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John 
Nguyen, based on above facts.
3)  Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.  
The recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list, and CS 
is not on it since no one is interested in working with them.   We should let 
them know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract 
placement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.    We 
accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with 
recruiting.    We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give 
them a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well 
defined.  They should contact me directly at that time.
4)  We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the 
difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them, 
Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been 
made, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in 
order to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer's 
decision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)  inadequate resume flow  2) 
poor working relationship with account manager.
5)  We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other 
company including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after 
addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.   Nor did 
she did send Mark Delaro's resume to Ergos.  We have no reason to believe 
that she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron, nor that 
she will in the future.
6) Cheryl Charles (Maddison) presented her resume to Robert and Ryan, and 
Ryan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks, and has not claimed association 
with CS.   We have no recruiter openings at this time, and she has been 
informed of this by Ryan and myself.

you would clarify.  I believe we were going to attempt a joint discussion 
after receipt and review of this draft.   I have good availability for a 
conference discussion on:

Monday 6/5/2000 - 12 through 6 PM PST 
Thursday 6/8/2000  - 12 through 5 PM PST
I will be trying to vacation in the interim periods.  Thanks,  I'll look

Global E&P are going to be sold.

I understand that you are looking for a lawyer with oil and gas experience.  
He might be a good candidate.  I met him today, and he is pleasant and 
professional.

If you are interested in interviewing him, let me know, and I will get it

Michelle,

I refer to my earlier voice messages and (I hope) a conversation you had with 
Stephen Wallace a week or so ago.

I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you, learn more about ENA and 
discuss what professional opportunities might exist within the ENA legal 
department. I will be in London for most of next week but other than that, I 
would be able to meet at your convenience.

I have attached a copy of my resume for your reference and look forward to 
hearing from you.

Regards,

Dominic Carolan

Jim,

If you are sure you don't want reimbursement, then thanks a lot!!!  I hope 
that you both can join us.  If not, let's plan on another arrangement.  We 
are planning to stay at the Doubletree Suites in/near Georgetown (apparently, 
it is close to the Watergate).  It was way less expensive than the Embassy 
Suites we discussed the other day (approx. $100 per night!).  We are renting 
a car, though, so we can get around wherever we need to -- or, of course, we 
can take the Metro.

Talk to you later.

Michelle

Hi, Brooks.

He wants the newest Lyle Lovett album -- the soundtrack to Dr. T and the
Women.  Also, he is getting a Playstation II from me for his birthday (they
don't come out until this week, so he doesn't have it yet), so you could
find him a game for the new system.  He has said that he wants a new clock
radio, with AM/FM (I don't think he wants CD/tape player on it), with
battery backup -- Sony would be best.  Also, he always wears short-sleeved
Polo shirts, size XL.  He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he
never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue.

Let me know if you need any other suggestions.

We are looking forward to your visit, especially Cameron.  He always is
talking about how Santa is going to bring presents for him and Madison!
Take care, and say "hi" to Marianne.

I don't do EBS, but I have asked Kriste Sullivan to send me the info you 
requested.  You also may want to check with Shelly Pierce in EBS compensation 
to see what she knows.  Michelle

Michelle,

Do you do employment agreements for EBS, if not, who is the attorney I should 
contact?  Bill is a Trading Manager for EBS and will be transferring to EGM 
in the near future.  Bill evidently had a draft of an employment agreement 
that was not executed.  Shankman and Nowlan want to offer him a contract and 
want to start with the same terms drafted by EBS.

Thanks,
Shanna

Anne,

I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.  From my perspective, it 
generally looks fine.  I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add 
any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.

In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.  I 
believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be 
identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds 
$250K.    We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the 
provisions of Section 4.13(iii).

Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not 
required by law.  However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the 
future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key 
personnel to stay with the company through closing.  This may be done with 
the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.  Section 6.2(e) contains 
a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.

In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any 
employment contracts.  We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, 
and the contracts of key personnel may expire.  Do we want to tie our hands 
and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?  Section 6.2(l) 
also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.

In Section 4.10, the wording "(other than Environmental Laws)" suggests that 
we are not in compliance with environmental laws.  Rephrasing that sentence 
to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.

In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind 
to customers.  I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host 
client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and 
provide Enron goodies to people all the time.  Perhaps a limitation on de 
minimus gifts would be more accurate.  Also, a reference to our Code of 
Ethics may work here.

In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, 
or does it include equity grants that vest over time?  A reference to "cash" 
payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock 
options/restricted stock that vest over time.

In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates 
vesting -- Pat, do you know?

Should Section 7.3 be italicized?  I have not seen the latest of the Employee 
Matters Agreement.

Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the 
purposes of dispute resolution?

Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any 
other questions.

Michelle

Trey, it looks like I may have to be in Portland for a mediation on July 27 
-- with travel on the 26th and the 28th.  Are you planning to be gone then, 
too?  If not, I'll schedule this trip (wanna join me with CAC and spend the 
weekend?).

I hope you are having fun and not working too hard.  Don't worry too much 
about me.  Gwyn is coming over to join us for dinner tonight, and Kay is 
dropping by tomorrow -- she offered to watch Cameron if I needed to do 
stuff.  I do miss you, though.

L, M

I'd like to wait until we get legal opinion first.  Once we know there are no 
DOL/ERISA issues (or at least some we can manage), we can set-out the process 
flow and then the companies.  I'll coordinate a conference call -- but let's 
do this after the holidays.  So many of the players are not here at the same 
time and I am sure payroll has as many year end issues as we do right now.

(Sheri, please contact Michelle Cash and Pat Mackin to get available dates 
and then set-up a conference call including the above people as well as Mikie 
Rath and Dolores Lenfest.  We probably need to do this as soon as possible in 
the new year.  Can you also include Jane Pleli, Joann Hill and Sherry 
Lessner, there may be issues with us changing current environment prior to 
7/1/2000 that we need to consider.)

Thanks

Subject: Re: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals  

For the employees to be provided with domestic benefits, they could just be 
placed on the standard domestic payroll, whereas the employees not to have 
domestic benefits could be on the new company.  As Cynthia states below, the 
new company (as a whole) would not be adopting benefit plans.  Logistically, 
there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires 
on the correct company.

Also, the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once SAP 
Payroll comes online 7/1.  Currently, there is some manual intervention when 
charging from one company (like Expat Services) to the appropriate accounting 
company.

Mike

The not making them eligible for domestic benefits is easy.  The new payroll 
company will simply not adopt the plans.  I am assuming that the number of 
employees (nor associated demographics) in this company will not create a 
discrimination problem.    

One question though, will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you 
want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not.  If 
the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps.

Let me know if we can help.

Subject: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign Nationals

As Enron expands globally, we are faced with a growing issue of more and more 
foreign nationals entering the US on varied lengths of assignment.  For some, 
it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain 
retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash 
balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the 
fact they will return to their home country to retire.  If they remain on 
their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method 
to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well 
as receive US $.

Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.  He is paid by the UK a 
portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.  The remainder of his salary is 
paid on US payroll.  This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.  No 
FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.  
Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as 
they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, 
health/welfare and retirement benefits.  We indicated in his employment 
agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.

I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.  Would it be 
possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign 
nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a 
mechanism to:

receive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US account
pay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicare
not make them eligible for domestic benefits

I would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.

Thanks,

Jane

If there are going to be revisions to the leave policy, I suggest that we

leave --i.e., two separate policies.  Let's talk about this on Tuesday -----

Subject: Leave Policy

Here are a few edits to the Approved Time Off and Leaves of Absence policy.

Benefits has not included a "second or third opinion by another health care 
provider paid for by the Company" as it has significant implications to our 
LTD plan and has created at least one problem that I am aware of in the past.
We will need to think through what the certification document might look like 
and would look to you for some guidelines.   The concern I have is around 
privacy and use of information given potential regulation.
Cynthia believes that we should run FMLA concurrent with sick time.  I agree 
and have noted that in the document.   

Sharon, could you please review the wording to ensure I haven't missed 
something here from a legal perspective.  I will follow-up with you by phone 
shortly.  

Susan, here are the "long-since promised" wording changes we propose.     

Thanks,

Elaine

Tara,

We can make the salary retroactive as part of the contract.  Have we already 
sent you executables?  If so, we can re-run with a provision that states, 
"Effective 3/1/00, Employee's Monthly Base Salary shall be $xxxx."  The 
effective date still can be 6/1.

Twanda, would you please make that change and run executables?

Thanks.

Michelle

Michelle/Twanda

On the nomination form for Mark Schroeder's agreement, it requests to 
backdate the salary to March 1st, even though the effective date of the 
agreement is not until June 1st. Can this be incorporated into the agreement 
or do we need to do a side letter to Mark?

Thanks
Tara

My understanding now on this is that we are talking about the Bridgeline 
deal.  In that deal, Enron and Texaco both assigned employees to work for the 
Bridgeline entity.  It is done under a secundment arrangement, and the 
employees are sent there via an assignment letter.   (Pat, you may recall 
that we visited about this process a while back, although I may not have 
given you the transaction name at the time).  

So, currently, all Enron personnel assigned to Bridgeline actually are Enron 
employees.  I am not aware of any change to that structure.  Fran, do you 
know of any changes?  Are we now going to transfer all of those employees to 
the Bridgeline entity?  Those answers would help.

Michelle

Mikie and Wilson,

Please send me a copy of the transaction document, or if there is not one,
the letter of intent.

Will there be a sale of assets?

Will Texaco have any continuing obligation to provide Enron with services in
connection with the transaction?

Will Texaco be required to make  offers of employment to Enron employees?

I can't respond to the question about the same desk rule unless I know all of
the facts.  Earlier this year, in Rev Rul 2000-27 the IRS relaxed the same
desk rule to a sale of less than substantially all of the assets of a
business.  I need to understand the facts of the Texaco transaction to
determine if there is a fit.

Generally, an "outsourcing," pursuant to which the third party service
provider offers employment to Enron employees and thereafter provides
services to Enron, is subject to the same desk rule.

Kathy,

Here is Wayne's response to the HR due diligence questions that Michelle 
proposed.  What are your thoughts?  Let me know what you need, and I will 
push him for adequate answers.  I will forward you the e-mail of the employee 
manual.  In addition, I believe Maribel Mata in due diligence has a hard copy 
of Power System's employee manual; you may call her and see if you can get it 
(I left her a message letting her know you may be calling her).

Thanks,

Michelle, looks good.  I don't know the details of this one, but if you get 
the Buyer to agree it is very generous for the employee.  Regarding Pension 
Plan, if you get Dee the list of employees, we can get an idea of the 
unvested amounts by employee.  Since this appears to be an asset sale, Enron 
can either pay this outside of the plan or consider it forfeited.

Subject: Privileged and Confidential--Project Triple Lutz


Tim,

Anne Koehler asked me to provide general employment terms for Project Triple 
Lutz.  I have spoken with persons in HR and benefits and have put together 
the following "headlines" for employee matters.  This list is a first cut, 
based upon my discussions with persons I could reach today; thus, it may not 
be exhaustive.  Details of certain issues, as described below, will have to 
be worked out.

Of course, your team may choose to modify/delete items from this list, 
depending on the exact nature of the deal.  In the interest of time, however, 
I am sending this list to our lawyers at V&E to begin drafting the employee 
provisions of the sale agreement, which I understand you would like to see on 
Thursday.  Any modifications based upon your team's comments should not be 
difficult.

The employment provisions may include:

Buyer will hire all employees identified by Seller.
The hired employees will have a title that is at least the same/equivalent as 
their title at Enron for a two-year period after closing.
Buyer will give all hired employees credit for years of service at Enron for 
purposes of participation in Buyer's benefits (though not accruals), thus 
allowing the hired employees to have immediate participation in Buyer's 
benefit and compensation plans (e.g., 401k, vacation eligibility, etc.).
The hired employees will be paid, at a minimum, the same base salary they 
earned at Enron (which would include the merit increase for 2001) for a 
two-year period after closing.
The hired employees will receive the same level of total cash compensation as 
their last year of Enron employment for one full year after closing (the 
buyer can make this happen through base salary, bonus, etc.).
The hired employees will receive benefits (e.g., health insurance, life 
insurance, etc.) that are comparable to those they had in their last year of 
employment with Enron (although we probably will have some discussions over 
our sick leave policy, which is generous).
Buyer will retain severance benefits at Seller's level for one year after 
closing, after which the hired employees will be eligible for severance under 
the Buyer's plans (with credited service).
Before Buyer terminates the employment of a hired employee (other than for 
cause -- to be defined), Buyer shall inform Seller, which will have the right 
to re-employ the employee at Enron, with credited service.
For employees with less than 5 years of service, some concession for unvested 
portion of Cash Balance Plan may be necessary.

Open issues/questions include:

Equity:  What is to be done with unvested equity?  For example, in December, 
every Enron employee will be granted stock options worth 25% of their base 
salary (based on the Black-Scholes valuation).  Also, persons with other 
equity grants may forfeit those grants upon closing.  An evaluation of the 
various plans and participants will be necessary to determine exactly where 
any issues exist, as well as possible resolutions of those issues.  In light 
of the appreciation in Enron's stock, this equity issue may be significant.
Pension:  What will happen to hired employees with potential eligibility 
under Enron's pension plan?

If you have any questions about these issues, please give me a call at x 
3-6401.  If I receive additional feedback, I will let you know.

Thanks.

Michelle

Subject: Data Room Information - Toucan

The information that we have requested from the Georgia Pacific data room has 
been sent to us here in Houston and is available for your review in EB2943. 
We are obligated under the confidentiality agreement that Enron has signed to 
keep all information provided to us confidential and to return all 
information, including any reproductions, at the end of this process. 
Therefore, I ask that where possible you minimize photocopying (we have 
EB2943 set aside for our exclusive use) and let me know what photocopies you 
have made.

Based on the management presentations and other information available we have 
changed the scope for our potential acquisition of the GP assets. We will: 
Proceed with the Leaf River mill with the expectation of submitting a binding 
bid 
Perform some additional due diligence to determine whether we should further 
pursue the Woodland mill, and
Not pursue the Brunswick mill.

Given the altered scope no work is required in evaluating Brunswick. By Oct. 
1st we will decide whether to submit a bid for Woodland. GP still requires 
that binding bids be submitted by mid-November and this date will apply to 
both Leaf River and Woodland. Regardless of the delayed decision with respect 
to Woodland we have little time to understand the issues/risks and to 
conclude on the impact on whether Enron would want to own these assets and at 
what cost. 

We want your feedback as soon as possible so that we can incorporate that 
information into the internal management approval process and consequently 
the bid(s) that we will be submitting. Our current schedule has the 
management approval process beginning on November 9th.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Sure, you could ask.  I think that Kriste's draft was prepared before my 
draft, which I sent to Rosen in executable form.  Britt, by copy of this 
email, I'll ask Twanda to send you the copies from my file here.

Thanks for the update.

Subject: In re Enron Claim Against ERI

Dorie and Michelle,

This will confirm my telephone conferences with Dorie this morning.  Again, I 
was able to contact Rodney Tow, and Tow reported to me that he spoke with Joe 
Walker of TMAC this morning and told him that Enron did not want him at the 
party.  Tow will follow that up with a note to Walker.

I believe Walker's confusion was created by Diane Neilsen.  Before he called 
Walker, Tow read to me a telefax that Neilsen had sent to Walker after 
hearing from Tow that we did not want Walker at the party.  The fax simply 
said that Enron did not want any type of religious orientation in the show, 
but never said that Enron didn't want him at the party.

I also asked Walker how he was doing on getting our security in place.  Tow, 
who had just walked into the office when I called, said that he was working 
on it, that he had just received a letter from Neilsen regarding it (which he 
apparently had not read), and that he had to let me go because he had clients 
on the line.

On another note:  I received a copy of a transmittal memorandum from Kriste 
Sullivan to Mike Rosen, which attaches an unexecuted copy of a confidential 
draft of the Master Consulting Services Agreement between Enron Corp. and 
Event Resources Inc. in this matter.  Kriste says in the memo that her 
records do not indicate that execution copies were prepared.

The signature blanks are for Mark Palmer of Corp. and Ken Price of ERI (who 
has left).  I was going to try to interview Price anyway regarding such 
things as where ERI kept its money, whether he believed that when he signed 
the Hilton agreement he was signing as an agent, and other matters.  I can 
also ask him if he ever signed any master agreement with Enron.  What do you 
think?

Britt

Debi,

Your response should go as follows.  I suggest doing it in writing, rather 
than an email that could be manipulated.  If you have theri fax number, that 
probably would be best.  Also, I suggest that we ask CS not to identify us as 
a reference or to use our name in any type of advertising or publicity 
materials.  We prefer to keep our vendor list private.

Dear Ms. Poss,

 Thank you for your written  request for a reference on Contracting 
Solutions.  It is not our practice to provide references for contracting 
agencies.  I would suggest that you contact another company that does 
business with Contracting Solutions to obtain the information you seek.  I am 
sure that Contracting Solutions can provide you with alternatives.

 By the way, I spoke with Jennifer Cronin, who had referred your call to me.  
She indicated that you had identified Contracting Solutions as the subject 
matter of your request.  

 Sincerely yours, Debi Vanwey

Debbi,

First off, I am wondering how you knew the company name I was calling on.  I
never gave that other girl the name of the company.

Any how, I am wanting information on Contracting Solutions, Inc.  They
listed your company as a reference, and I have been trying to chase this
down for about two months now.  I have been able to contact the other two
references they had given, but the one with your company has been a bear to
run down.

They stated that they have worked with your company on a permanent
placement.  Is this correct?

How was their performance? (did they respond timely with qualified
candidates? With legitimate resumes of real people or were the people no
longer available when you wanted to interview them?, etc.)

Can you tell me if there have been any problems with this company? (if yes,
what are they.)

Are you currently doing business with them?  (If yes, please proceed to the
next question, if no, Please tell me why?)

Do you have any additional information that would assist me in doing
business with this company?

Is there any way you can respond as soon as possible, I would like to either
approve them or close this file.

Priscilla

Here is the note that went out.  I'm giving a speech this morning and will be 
out all afternoon, but I will try to catch you in between.  Also, I am in

Subject: Note from Sally

To all Energy Operations employees:

ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially 
proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.  
I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that 
you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you 
for that.  

Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA 
and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make 
sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and 
that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will; 
to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we 
could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools" 
and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants 
who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will 
meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight 
our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, 
and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.  
Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that 
input.  

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only 
through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  
Thank you.

Sally

Hello, everyone.  Please let me know which of these dates works best for 
you.  It would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for 
both preparation and the deposition itself.  That way, I can find overlapping 
dates on which you all are available.  

Thanks a lot.

Bill, I had asked Twanda to get a conference call with you and Dana Davis on 
Williams.  I hope that happened . . .   I would like to have a petition ready 
early next week.  It will be lawsuit only, not injunctive relief.

I believe Ajello will be finalized this week.  I sent our signed version to 
Reliant last week, and I hope to have it signed by Ajello soon.  Once that 
happens, we can dismiss.

Thanks.  Michelle

Matt, 

Thanks for your email.  I believe that there is an agreement in place between 
ENA and Enron Expat Services.  In general, the contract is between ENA and 
the employee, if the person is an expat.  The assignment letter covers the 
employee's transfer to Expat Services.  We haven't usually amended/assigned 
the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc. are 
through ENA. 

If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them, 
and I am happy to handle it.

If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember 
right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.

I hope this answers your questions.  I have copied Sharon Butcher on this 
email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several 
years.  If you have further questions, please reply to both of us so that we 
can be aware of questions.

Thanks a lot.

Michelle

		 Subject: Re: URGENT : Employment Contract - Rich Slovenski

Michelle

Subject to any views Michelle Cash has, I would be happy to assist by 
drafting the agreed amendments to the Rich's Contract. I understand from 
Lilian that changes would only be to the Annex and would not affect the main 
body of the Contract. I can work with Lilian on this once she is able to 
finalise the agreed amendments with John Nowlan. 

I note your advice that ENA is the correct employing entity and the intended 
arrangement is a secondment from Enron Expat Services to ENA.  However, your 
suggestion for a clause in the Contract to reference the secondment would not 
be sufficient to put the arrangement in place. Rather, there should be an 
agreement between Enron Expat Services and ENA. I believe such an agreement 
is likely to be in place as Rich is not the first expat here in Singapore 
from ENA - John Chismar and John Thomas who are here precede him. 

Because I do not have the background to the relevant inter-company 
arrangement between ENA and Enron Expat Services, I would suggest  you 
discuss with Michelle Cash on to clarify this issue, and perhaps make the 
necessary amendments to the letter of offer which presently provides that 
Enron Expat Services is the employer and that Rich will be expected to 
provide services for ENA, instead of secondment from ENA to Enron Expat 
Services

Matt

Lillian,

We were discussing this with our International HR Rep and we feel that since 
the offer letter indicates Enron Expat Services as the employe, the 
employment agreement should reflect employment by ENA and we need to add a 
clause secunding Mr. Slovinski to Enron Expat Service.  PLEASE have Matthias 
make the amendments so we can get this in place as soon as possible.  I am 
sure that as long as Legal in Singapore makes the necessary changes it will 
be fine.  The important thing is to get Rich to sign the contract!

You did receive the employment agreements we fed-ex'd you on June 6th didn't 
you?  Make the necessary changes and send a copy to us.

This was our first Expat and it has been a real learning experience.

Per my email to you and Kim (copied John Nowlan and John Chismar) dated 22 
June, there were some amendments to his package which was only approved that 
day.  I do not have the soft copy of the executables to make the changes nor 
am I sure if I m allowed to make amendments to them without legal reviewing 
them.

Since Legal Singapore is aware of the situation, and if it is agreeable, we 
can make amendments to the existing hard copies and have Matthias review 
them.  This should expedite this.  However, we still need to know who would 
be the employers of Rich - ENA or Expat services.

Michelle / Kimberly

Please allow me to introduce myself - I am Legal Counsel for ECT Singapore. 

It has just been brought to my attention by our HR Specialist Lilian Low that 
the employment contract for our new trader Rich Slovensky has not been 
executed. You would appreciate that that gives us a slew of control, 
compliance and legal issues. Apart from confidentiality issues, Rich does not 
presently have authority to bind ECT Singapore in contracts.

Please let me have your very urgent advice whether we can expect Rich's 
employment contract to be in place immediately to regularise the situation or 
whether we have to implement measures to stop Rich's trading activity. 

Additionally, I noticed that the cover letter offering employment to Rich 
refers to employment with Enron Expat Services but the employment contract 
states that ENA is the employer. Please clarify or rectify as appropriate.

Regards
Matt Lee

Michelle -

It was grand to bump in to you last night at Randalls.  Your son looks like a 
bundle of energy.  Your cookie insights were not lost on my daughter.
She has secured my commitment to visit the bakery area first thing on our 
next trip. I'd say she considers it a good encounter.

Take care
Steve

Subject: Summary of Conversation

Terms and Conditions

Clause 6.  I raised the issue of a reasonableness test regarding place of 
work and whether we should include some wording.  I was advised that it was 
not required as it is implicit.

Clause 7.  They will include a no obligation to award an increase sentence.

Options, bonus and sign-on wording will be the ENE wording.

Clause 8. I asked to have wording made clear that it was ".. otherwise as 
required by the Company..."

Clause 9.  This will only apply to more senior levels.  The para will be 
omitted where overtime is relevant and this will be covered under work rules 
and be the statutory amounts.

Clause 10.  We agreed to go flat rate for holidays although we did discuss a 
two level approach as 20 days is generous for non managerial staff who will 
not use it all anyway.  You and I need to agree on this.

Clause 13.  I was right, it does read that we can only terminate for just 
cause and even then it is difficult to prove (there is a case that states 
that mere incompetence does not constitute Just Cause).  The definition 
examples are those recommended by the Lawyers although they are going to take 
up with them a couple of my suggestions to get their view.  Again I will talk 
you through this.  As far as employees giving notice, the statutory limit is 
2 weeks so the period in the contract is a moral agreement only, although 
this is taken more eriously in Japan than elsewhere.  We also discussed the 
exec agreement concept which they think will not work but are reviewing the 
wording with their lawyers.

Clause 19.  Although in the template, they would recommend including it as 
part of the normal terms and conditions so we need to wait for their comments 
on the exec agreement.

They are revising template for tomorrow morning.


Work Rules

Fairly standard and not required initially.  They are working on a draft for 
us to review and comment on.

Benefits including Pension

They agree with our selection of benefits although they recommend a lump sum 
allowance type all employee pension plan which is  a book reserve which pays 
out on termination based on salary and length of service.  This is very 
common and supplements the Government pension scheme.  This would in in 
addition to SRAP and they are sending me more details.

Issues

Corporate/Employment Filings.  They mentioned that there are a number of 
filing requirements that need to be done to get businesses underway.  Do we 
know what we have doen to date on this front?

Options.  Although these schemes are common there is a lot of legal prep work 
involved so I intend to see if Enron Corp HR has started this with Japn, if 
not I will get it rolling.

Expat Contracts.  They would like to review our expat contract terms, can you 
provide these or do I have them?



I will call you to discuss.  Ihave another conference call with them tomorrow 
morning.

WORK DESCRIPTIONS (LONG AND SHORT FORM)



	


I talked briefly to Carmen this morning about plans to revise the above 
agreements and associated arrangements for processing them. ]

Since I am retiring on June 30, 2000, I have no territorial interest in what 
happens but I think I would be remiss if I didn't at least offer a couple of 
comments: 

1.  Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some 
has been effective.  It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an 
agreement.  This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which 
vendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which 
we treat different vendors.  I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide 
and conquer approach. 

2.  The agreements need to be updated.  I know that there are some reasons 
for using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR 
PROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could 
be worked out.  It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is 
some duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., 
all things that could be fixed rather easily. 

3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover 
all kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.

4.  If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an 
arrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement 
but the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for 
anything that they might do on the PWD. 

I realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what 
it is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view 
it with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking 
a methodology that has served us.

Thanks.  gene

Kerry, is this necessary?  I don't agree to all the terms in here, and I
really don't want to spend a lot of time with ELT to negotiate the
agreement.  For example, the part where we will be billed for developmental
costs if we cancel within a certain period of time.  From my perspective,
that is inappropriate since I spent more time than ELT on developing this
product, and  you are simply delivering a product that you and I already
prepared and completed on several occasions across North America.  There
will be one new scripted section, but that should be from the actors, and
it should not be significant.  Also, there are not appropriate
confidentiality provisions, etc.  So, I would have to negotiate it with ELT
for it to be acceptable to us.

The last time, you just billed for time, and the actors billed separately.
I prefer that approach, if we can do it that way.  If I am being a major
prima donna and it creates a big problem for you internally, let me know,
and I can review it and comment back to ELT.

Thanks.  Michelle

I am available at 3:00 Wednesday.  I agree that we should convene and

Vincente suggests a conference call Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 or 3:00pm,

He will be at the facility Wednesday morning and will have a report about

Dear Michelle---Just a note to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you
today.  Thank you for taking time to learn more about my background and
experience and to share your Enron story with me.  I am very interested in
the available position because I welcome the opportunity to learn new things
and improve my skills.  Although I have not worked at a law firm, I am
fortunate to say that my in-house experience has been very hands-on with most
of the transactions and all of the labor matters handled without outside
counsel.  I discussed this point at some length with Elizabeth Sager and left
a reference list with Molly McGee in HR.  Looking forward to hearing from you
soon,

Alice Ginsburgh

Cindy, Tim, Marly, Pam, and Neil -- 

I will make my house available for you do do the first week of laundry this 
weekend.  How about 6:30 am on Saturday?  After that, you can schedule it at 
your convenience for the rest of the 4 weeks.  

I am prepared for you ; I bought Tide, Downey, and Bounce, as well as spray 
starch for all the ironing that needs to be done -- don't worry, I only have 
5-6 full-sized tablecloths and about 15 of Trey's shirts to be ironed.  That 
shouldn't take too long.

See you then. 

Michelle

Subject: Che Club Meeting - This Lunchtime - was rather lonely

Gerry, Michelle and I rather enjoyed our discussion at lunch time. It was 
highly productive and I would like to thank those who took the time out of 
their very busy schedules to attend.

In no small way related to the high calibre of the people at the meeting and 
the skills of the facilitation, we accomplished a great deal. For ease of 
reference and to make sure you each are clearly on you action before our next 
meeting, here is a summary:

General Minutes
The group voted David, Michele and Gerry as the most intelligent and 
attractive members of the HR community
Gerry had the most interesting strory about disciplining people who are 
always late for meetings by having their houses visited by a radical 
Californian based sect who do the reverse of an exorcism.
The average IQ of those present was measured as over 200 (thanks to Michelle).
Gerry won the tic tack tow tournament 
I won the biggest feet competition

Follow up action points
It was agreed that Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam would do the laundry for 
Michelle for the next 4 weeks.
It was agreed that Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam would clean David and 
Gerry's houses every Tuseday and Thursday for the next month (Gerry is 
concerned about his antique china and has requested that Neil doesn't visit 
his home).
All the wrongs of the world are to be solved and the necessary actions 
implemented by Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam by next Monday at 5pm central 
time (including third world debt and world hunger).

Thanks

David

I agree with Brian.  I recently learned that someone can "hack" into the 
emeet site and pretend to be Jeff Skilling (as I discussed with you, Brian, 
this morning).  So, we probably should start with that group to see if there 
are any gaps in the email system.  

I would suggest that someone from Net Works -- Roberto DeLeon or his crew-- 
would be the appropriate technical support for this endeavor.  I agree with 
Brian that the focus should be on the impersonation of the office of the 
chairman and not the content of the email itself.

I am happy to assist in any way you would like.

David:

 I am less concerned about the substantive comments of the message as I am 
about the "forgery" of the ECT OTC mailbox.  Unless Michelle or another 
opines differently, I believe it is incumbent upon us to determine who 
mis-used that e-mail address.  This is not to say that an employee should be 
disciplined for raising complaints; obviously that would be retaliatory in 
nature.  And so, if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or 
old-fashioned letter with OTC, I would have no issue.  But, here, this person 
has sent a communication ostensibly from ECT's OTC and apparently has access 
to do so in the future.  In my mind, that activity must be addressed and 
ceased.

 I suspect that it is technologically feasible to determine the source of the 
message.  Unless there is objection, I would recommend an investigation 
(which my group can do) to determine the author.

Subject: Performance Review Process

After having lived through another PRC process, it has become exceedingly 
obvious that there are several issues that need improvement in the process.  
With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now 
communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to 
other parties without change.

1)  Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the 
upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period, 
not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already 
occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such 
review period.  This is only fair to our employees so that they know the 
criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.

2)  The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are 
willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without 
a bunch of red tape.  There is this idea that unsolicited input works within 
the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and 
it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.  There needs to be 
an unobstructed communication line for this input.  The theory of upward 
feedback should also be questioned.  I have never been asked to provide input 
to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I 
have worked for that position.  Are Managing Directors exempt from this 
process?  This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.  
How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with 
individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?

3)  There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the 
process.  There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute 
minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the 
job function.  I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to 
provide input were not even solicited.  There was one individual that 
partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was 
not even asked for input.

4)  What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our 
PRC definitions is still being debated.  It has been described by several HR 
representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.  Neither 
one of the definitions describes such performance as "simply doing the job".  
Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not 
effectively and precisely rate the employee.  What we end up with in the PRC 
is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to 
pull the entire group back a notch.  With better definitions and 
communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will 
give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be 
lacking.

Thanks for your listening ear.

Subject: RW separations

Michelle,

Please let know what you thing regarding the following:

1) Two of the RW employees have called asking about their Cobra coverage and 
whether or not they are due money for the coverage.  One could argue ( and 
they obviously are ) that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of 
their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation.

If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to 
everyone.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis.

2) Russell Gilardi's attorney has made comment that one could interpret his 
contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the 
year.  Here is the wording verbatim: 

'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the 
Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to 
terminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st 
January 2001.'

I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the 
separation agreements.  For your info, other RW employees with this 
particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out.

3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months 
to 3 months.   He was with MG for a little over a month.  I've asked the SVP 
of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow.   

Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end.!

Cathy

Julia,

On Garden State matters, how do you want to handle the signing of documents?  
Currently, I have been receiving documents from outside counsel and 
initialling them before signature.  Based upon Hoyt's email below, there may 
be a desire to have a more expeditious process.  

I would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department 
is going to be involved in GSP work.  Given our discussion last week, I would 
not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the 
standard Enron process, but it is not my call.

I would appreciate your thoughts.

Michelle, we talked about this at David's staff meeting last week and he 
seemed to want to develop a quicker process on approval when a lawyer such as 
Ann Murray or Pat McCarthy was involved.

I asked David Howe about this issue.  He said htat he wants to have an
attorney's initials on the document before he signs them.  So, I guess it
needs to go through me for now.  Michelle

     Michelle, we terminated Bill Nycz October 12, he is now ready to sign
     the release that Pat McCarthy wrote up.

     Once bill signs this, we will need to get a company signature pretty
     quickly to pay him expeditiously (i would like to cut the check as
     soon as his 7 days are up).  I assume that David Howe needs to sign it
     . . . does David have to have your approval to sign something like
     this?

     When Pat writes contracts for us, do i still need to get you to sign
     off on it before David Howe signs it?  If a management employee of GSP
     who is not an Enron employee signs a contract, do we have to have
     Enron legal approve it?

Mark, 

The pay equity issue sounds like the reviews we do every year to ensure that 
people are being paid equitably.  Given that the company has until November 
of next year to get in compliance and to report out on the compliance issue, 
it should be no big deal -- unless there currently are pay inequities.  A 
list of persons in each job, with salary and gender, could allow us to 
determine whether an issue even exists.

Michelle

Christopher -

Based upon your memo and our due diligence effort to date, is there any 
indication of (a) any steps Daishowa has taken to put the committee required 
under the Pay Equity Act or (b) any increase in compensation that would be 
consistent with the Pay Equity Act and therefore enable Daishowa to dispense 
with the need for a committee?  Is there any way to currently assess what 
potential liabilities could be or to view any industry data on this issue 
that may indicate how extensive liability could be???

The main concern is that we are negotiating with Daishowa to be in a position 
to undertake, as of closing, all responsibilities associated with all matters 
disclosed, unless there is a legal noncompliance issue (e.g., failure to 
maintain proper permits).  Since the requirements of the Pay Equity Act have 
not been identified to management as a concern, I need to ensure that this is 
a real issue (mostly from a $'s exposure standpoint) vs. something so remote 
that it should not even be discussed.

Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Michelle / Kimberly

Please allow me to introduce myself - I am Legal Counsel for ECT Singapore. 

It has just been brought to my attention by our HR Specialist Lilian Low that 
the employment contract for our new trader Rich Slovensky has not been 
executed. You would appreciate that that gives us a slew of control, 
compliance and legal issues. Apart from confidentiality issues, Rich does not 
presently have authority to bind ECT Singapore in contracts.

Please let me have your very urgent advice whether we can expect Rich's 
employment contract to be in place immediately to regularise the situation or 
whether we have to implement measures to stop Rich's trading activity. 

Additionally, I noticed that the cover letter offering employment to Rich 
refers to employment with Enron Expat Services but the employment contract 
states that ENA is the employer. Please clarify or rectify as appropriate.

Regards
Matt Lee

I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option 
of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP 
incentive plan.   She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.

Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the 
plan.  Jeanne, could you please circulate one?

I'll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this 
process should not wait for me.  Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we 
should be ready to finalize it.

Michelle,

The new program still needs final approval by the Enron Corp. board of
directors.  The design was tentatively approved last month, subject to final
review.  The following revised provision should serve you well in the
meantime:



All-Employee Stock Option Program

Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time
regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through
the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made
under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The
grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or
a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  Subject to final approval by the
Enron Corp. board of directors, a one time award of non-qualified stock
options under a replacement program is proposed to be made to eligible
employees as of December 29, 2000, in value equal to 25% of annual base
salary (5% of annual base salary for a 5-year period; salary valuation and
value may vary in some international locations).  Program awards are subject

Development Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock
awards will be made pursuant to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as
determined by the Committee.  The exercise price for grants of stock options
will be determined according to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which
the award is granted.  The program may or may not be offered in certain
domestic and international locations based upon management discretion and/or
local labor and employment laws.

Kerry,  What are your thoughts on this issue?

Michelle



Michelle,

We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime 
for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for 
assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who 
rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario.

For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the 
Night (N) shift.


  M T W Th F S

REG  8 8 8 8 8 
OT       8 
SHIFT  N N D D D D 


Interpretation 1

The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular 
rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)


Interpretation 2

Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as 
follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)

Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have 
totally missed the boat on both of them?

Thanks for your help,
Diane

Cathy,

Also, for persons over 40 who are signing waivers, we must provide them with 
the census data about persons under 40/over 40 who were offered a package, as 
well as their title and age.  Please make sure that happens, or our waivers 
will not be valid.

Thanks.

I certainly have the training and informational materials and can enlist Roy

McLean has been providing overall statistical reports to Cindy Olson, so 
these probably already exist and are being finalized for the VP/MD meeting 
7/31 and 8/1.

Let me know when you want me to provide these materials.

Subject: Agreements with non-employee contractors



Michelle,

While I think that "Enron" discourages entering into agreements for services
directly with non-employee contractors, there are times when a business
decision is made to do so on a very limited basis.  Aside from other legal
issues, one single issue that has received a lot of attention in recent years
is the issue addressed by the Microsoft case involving the question under
what circumstances are individuals designated as independent contractors
entitled to employee benefits provided by  an employer to its employees.

While we have amended the various employee benefit plans to address this
issue, another place where it can be effectively addressed is in the contract
for services.

Recently, I was involved with a project to develop provisions to be included
in such a service agreement with non-employee contractors who will not be
entitled to employee benefits.  I thought you might have an interest in this,
so I have attached the contract provisions that were developed for this
circumstance along with an analysis.

I wonder if there are other attorneys who design and draft such agreements
who would be interested in receiving this information?

Regards,

Pat

Mark,  although I will hate to lose  Carlos and everyone here at EECC and 
NEPCO wants him to stay, in point of fact he has repaid his debt to society 
and is entitled to look at opportunites outside of EECC now. Please feel free 
to talk with him. He is discussing matters with Vicki et al now, and  she is 
aware that he will be contacting ENA (EWS?)as well.  

 As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that 
his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, 
and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity 
and finance related matters (including work-outs).  I do think well of 
Carlos, and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

Andrea, This looks good.

I have two nits:  First, the street value of our phone book is $1k, not $1.  
Also, "loosing" people should be "losing" people.

One other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal 
confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no 
filter on what employees can/can't put.  In other words, if an employee is 
working on developing something within Enron that our competitors do not know 
about, expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy.

One other recommendation (by Scott) was to allow access only from an Enron 
facility -- not remotely.  This would manage risk of a person taking a laptop 
to a competitor and also would protect against hackers.

Given that employee talent is a major asset, we should find ways to move that 
talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside.

Thanks.

Michelle

Hello, everyone.  Please let me know which of these dates works best for 
you.  It would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for 
both preparation and the deposition itself.  That way, I can find overlapping

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail to you, I would like to use 
contractors from the two firms listed below.  Both of these firms have 
contractors available now, so as soon as we get these agreements in place we 
can bring them in and put them to work.  If possible, I'd like any agreement 
we put in place to be flexible enough to allow us to use other contractors in 
the future besides those we currently have identified.  If you need me to do 
anything else or if you are not the right person to talk to, please let me 
know.  Thanks.

Privileged and Confidential -- Advice Covered by the Attorney-Client Privilege

K2: 

I have copied this email to Sharon & Kriste, who are supporting the CALME 
region.  My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because 
their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be 
employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee 
compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).  This exposure could be high.  
Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating 
them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

Hi Michelle, 

Please see my note below regarding including JV employees and Consultants in 
our PEP system and the PRC. Could you please give us more expert legal advice 
(from my own : - )!!) in relation to this? We want to ensure that we cover 
ourselves.

Thanks, K2.

David, 

I've been forwarded a voicemail on Friday from David Haug where he has 
requested that we include CALME's JV employees and Consultants who are at the 
VP level. (He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).  
Monica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only 
AIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David's 
instance I'm reverting to you for a decision. 

Although I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV's - my concern is 
primarily with the Consultants.

Below are my concerns in accommodating this request:-

- The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has 
finished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the 
system message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In 
this instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie's team to 
communicate to all reviewers of the JV's that they are required to give 
feedback.

- The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees 
in order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to 
describe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality 
issues and I want us to be aware of what we're doing regarding this.

Call me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail, 

K2

Yes the two are the new policy and agreement; the "annotated" has not been
revised, but explains the point about Exhibit C to the Agreement.

Wow. You should have received these awhile ago. We had a virus shutdown,
but
I cannot think of any other reason why you do not have these. Let me state
what I attempted to state in my last message:

     1) As to the Data Protection Agreements, we contemplate that an
Exhibit C will be attached that will describe the non-exclusive types of
information that will be personal data. For your information I am resending
the "annotated" version of this agreement to describe the significance of
the removal of brackets. We also added a section 3.g to allow additions to
the purposes for collection. As the regulators in the EU become more
refined
in their analysis and requirements as to the statement of purpose, you
might
need to alter purposes.

     2) As to the Policy itself, we inserted a line that dates the
revision of the policy, and we added a provision in Section 2 corresponding
to the change in Section 3.g mentioned above.

Please call me to let me know that you got this. Should I send something to
John?!

Dawn,

I have not seen a request form for his contract.  I believe that Teresa Bien 
was working on it with Mark Haedicke.  I am copying her on this email so that 
if I am mistaken, she can let me know.

Thanks.

No, I have not sent any information.  I doubt that Hoyt has, either.  You 
send them the information before they sign.  I would just do a cover memo and 
references the agreement, where there is a specific provision about receipt 
of information.

What's the protocol?  Do we wait for them to sign before I send the the ODWP 
info or should I send it now.  The only people this applies to are Mo and

Do you have a memo that usually goes out with the information?

Also, for persons over 40 who are signing waivers, we must provide them with 
the census data about persons under 40/over 40 who were offered a package, as 
well as their title and age.  Please make sure that happens, or our waivers 
will not be valid.

Thanks.

Hector/Valeria,

Do we have a rule against heaters?  If not, that seems to be the easiest 
solution, as well as the "dress warm" advice.  I think that moving him would 
not be good -- his isolation could work against our goals here.

Your thoughts?

 I got the answer to the voicemail message I left for you about which lawyer 
would be the contact for the Enron Europe countries for the new Enron 
employee stock option plan.  Jon Chapman will be responsible for Norway, 
Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey (and any other Enron Europe countries that 
are added between now and December).  I assume you are the appropriate lawyer 
for Mexico.  (If not, please forward this message to the right lawyer, and cc 
me so that I know who it is!)  Please read the message below for an 
explanation of the first action item (due June 23rd).  The Mexico spreadsheet

Jonathon:
 I was in a meeting this morning concerning the new Enron employee stock 
option plan that will be implemented at the end of this year, and Melissa 
Laing (who participated by telephone) informed me that you were the lawyer to 
support Enron Europe HR on this project.  I recently joined the Enron Corp. 
legal staff from Enron International legal.  My role in this project is to 
coordinate the international legal support for the new option plan.  As such, 
I have contacted lawyers in various international business units to work with 
local counsel in each of the countries in which Enron has employees who will 
participate in the plan, to ensure that the plan does not run afoul of any 
legal restrictions.  Based on current information (which is likely to change 
between now and December, per Melissa Laing), the relevant countries in the 
Enron Europe group are Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.  In the 
attachment labeled "asiapac" at the end of Jana Domke's message, you will 
find spreadsheets for all five of the Enron Europe companies.  Please review 
(with local counsel, if necessary) the information in the "Legal Compliance" 
section of each spreadsheet to confirm that the information therein is 
accurate.  Please forward any changes or comments to me and Jana Domke (Jana 
has requested that the review be complete by June 23rd).  The Public 
Relations department is currently preparing the written material that will 
communicate the details of the plan to the participating employees.  When 
that is available, I will send it to you so that you may make any 
modifications that are necessary to comply with local laws in each of the 
Enron Europe countries.  The communication documents will be available in 
English, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Greek.  Please call me at 
713-853-5698 with any questions.  Thank you for your assistance!

		 Subject: AESOP 2000 - Country Summaries

If you attended the recent AESOP meeting, you are aware that the approval for 
establishing an Enron AESOP 2000 Program was granted by the Executive 
Committee on April 6, 2000.  In most instances, the plan design replicates 
the prior Plan parameters.  However, on an international basis, there have 
been numerous regulatory and legislative changes which may impact this 
program.

Attached are individual Country Summary Highlights which consolidate the 
various accounting/tax/legal/banking/human resource, etc. details and issues 
into one document.  This consolidated document is based not only on 
information gleaned from the previous AESOP inplementation, but it also 
reflects the most recent local tax changes - at least based upon the 
information we have here.

Because successful Plan implementation and rollout is predicated upon solid 
information, understanding and interpretation, we need your assistance.  
Please coordinate review of the your appropriate country documents with your 
local financial, legal, tax and/or other professionals, as required.  We want 
to ensure that AESOP incents our employees and reinforces the "One ENRON" 
philosophy - but at the same time, we need to ensure this program is cost 
effective, tax efficient, legally defensible and culturally acceptable in 
your areas of responsibility. 

Please document any specific issues and/or concerns, and where appropriate, 
provide input on viable options, corrective action, etc.. Also, if you have 
plans to be in other foreign locations prior to AESOP implementation and they 
need to be included, please advise ASAP.  Please send your responses via 
e-mail to either Dung Huynh or myself or by fax to (713) 646-7203.  If you 
have questions or if you need to discuss further, please call me @ (713) 
345-6142.  Our timeline is tight so would appreciate your responses at the 
latest by June 23rd - earlier if possible.  

Once we have the input, we'll roll this information up into a revised Summary 
Document, identifying issues that need further assessment/discussion and move 
forward to coordiinate final resolution with the AESOP team members.


Appreciate your assistance!

Regards/Jana Domke & Dung Huynh


PS - I apologize ahead of time for not getting all the countries correctly 
sorted by region.  You may need to extrapolate your specific locations from 
one or more of the following attachments.

The attorneys for Rick Clonch want to depose you in December.  What are the 
commercial reasons that we can use to argue against that?  For example, are 
you working on deals that require you to be out of town?  Are you too busy 
(explain in detail)?  If you provide me with this information, I can forward 
it to our lawyers, who can use it to try to move the depositions until 
January.

Your quick reply would be helpful.

George, I know we talked about your scheduled international travel.  Any

I have asked Sarah Reyna, Finley Biggerstaff's assistant to send to you

with senior management (there is only one, for Fred Inglis, the plant

Attached is a 12-Month Direct Compensation Profile document which we have 
asked Chris Tull to program (final programs need to be completed by 8/30/00).

Michelle:  We'd appreciate it if you will review the document and write the 
appropriate legal disclaimer that should be placed on the bottom of the 
document.

Chris:  The document includes the revisions we talked about.  Also, the 2nd 
page of the 1st worksheet includes all the add'l cash comp to include (by 
codes).

Pam:  This is the document Robert shared with you.  Do you foresee any 
problem with the data to be reflected in the document?

Michelle:

Thanks for the call.  I have not heard from Marty Christian (spelling?)
about training but will be glad to talk to her about scheduling.  Regarding
the cost, the price I quoted before was $1500 for half day, and $2500 for a
whole day.  The actors are $100 apiece per presentation ($300 total for each
presentation). Typically, I can do three sessions in a half day and five in
a whole day.  Thus, total cost with the actors for a half day would be $2400
and $4000 for a whole day.  One issue with the actors is that they do shows
in the morning at their theater so afternoons usually are better for them.
I know they have some Fridays in November in which they are open full days.

Hi Michelle

Attached are the three review forms that are being proposed for the mid-year 
reviews accross all business units.  The VP form remains unchanged from the 
end of year 99 review.  The other two forms have been created based on the VP 
format.    Can you please review and advise if there are any issues with this.



Secondly, can you advise on the issues, if any, on providing consolidated  
feedback to a VP PRC Committee group (i.e. 26 MD's) on all VP's we have in 
Enron.   There has been a request that we provide this to this group other 
than the direct supervisor.

Thirdly, is there any issues with us or a HR representative  inputting 
feedback into the PEP system in another language ie. spanish/portguese.

Many thanks,

Karen.

David,

As far as I can tell, Mike McCall is not under a current employment 
agreement.  I sent you a draft agreement for him on December 2, 1999, and 
have heard nothing more about the status of that agreement.

I do not have any other information about the terms of his employment 
(salary, options, etc.).

Let me know if you would like any other information from me.

Pete,

I learned today of a deal involving a newsprint plant in New Jersey, which 
you are running from the legal side.

Are there any issues involving personnel or labor involved in this deal?  If 
so, I would appreciate your getting me in the loop as early as possible.

Subject: EU-US "Safe Harbor" agreement

Jane:

I participated in a lunch yesterday on Capitol Hill which discussed the 
recently concluded bilateral negotiations between Europe and the US on the 
issue of data privacy/safe harbor.  I admit that I don't fully understand the 
issue, but in essence I'm told it's an internal EU directive passed a few 
years ago (not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet, by 
the way) that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of 
the privacy of transmitted data (eg, over the internet).   The EU wants to 
forbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don't "adequately 
protect" the information.  As always, the EU wants to regulate the issue, 
while the US prefers self-regulation.  After two years of negotations, they 
agreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be 
put in "safe harbors", which are basically approved bodies that would check 
the recipient's ability to protect the privacy of the information, ie, an 
American company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or 
offices.  

How does this affect Enron?  A couple of other company reps said it is 
especially pertinent to HR issues, such as transmitting personnel 
information, salary, etc. from Europe back to the home office in the US.

Given our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe, does this affect 
us, and do you want us to track down more information?

Regards,
Steve Burns

a consultant, Hoyt Thomas (who has been working as an Enron HR consultant for 
a few weeks), to handle interim HR responsibilities until GSP hires a new HR 
person.  I suspect that you will be involved in a lot of advice/counselling 
in the next few weeks as this transition occurs.  If you are available on 
Friday, I would like to have a phone introduction of you and Hoyt.   Would 
you please call my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 713-853-6401, to let her know 
your availability so that she can set up a conference call?  Thanks a lot.

Twanda, would you please set this up when Pat calls?

Michelle

Attached for your review and input are initial cuts at the schedules for the 
draft P & S Agreement that we will be discussing on our call tomorrow 
morning.  You'll see that in many places the drafts are simply placeholders 
for information that some of you will need to provide, but hopefully they 
provide a useful starting point.  I  cannot overstate the importance of the 
schedules.  They have a direct impact upon the representations that ENA will 
be making to a potential purchaser and any errors in the schedules can result 
in serious financial liability for the company.

We need to have our schedules for Pastoria ready for posting on DealBench by 
the end of this week.

Thanks for your continued efforts.  I look forward to talking with you 
tomorrow.

Hi Phil-

The tests appear to be quite comprehensive and are likely to be useful.  Paul 
Davis, from Baker & McKenzie is currently looking into the Japanese legal 
issues and stated that he will be able to respond to us in a couple of days.  
Michelle Cash will be looking at your responses to her queries from the Enron 
perspective.

Best regards,

John

Hi John

The battery of tests includes the following:

a. Global Personality Inventory (GPI) 
description: The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data 
collected and developed by a team of industrial/organizational psychologists 
from around the world. The GPI measures personality for the work context in 
general and for professional for the work context and contains 37 distinct 
scales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models. 
Japan norms: Japanese mid-level, front-line manager, and individual 
contributor norms available. 

b. Advanced Progressive Matrices (Ravens)  
description: This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia 
through Coyne-Didsbury/PDI, and correlates highly with other tests of problem 
solving capacity. Global PDI manager/executive norms available.

c. Leadership Inventory-plus 
description: a PDI-structured tool used in the selection of entry and 
mid-level managers, measuring those basic abilities, traits, values, 
interests, and motivations that are critical to effective leadership. The LI+ 
includes both personality and cognitive ability (i.e., numerical, analytical, 
and verbal reasoning) components. U.S. manager norms available.

The intention is to use the testing on local hires (not US nationals) to 
confirm/expand on information gained in the interviewing process.  Reference 
checking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some 
objective abilities testing against standard norms.  The important thing is 
that we don't use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we 
take on a candidate or not.  

The bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important 
part of a high quality recruiting effort (and have been demonstrated as such 
in Australia on several occasions); unless there are significant legal 
impediments I want to proceed with them.

Thanks

Phil-

I have raised the issue of testing with Michelle Cash, an ENA labor lawyer, 
whose comments and queries are set forth below, for your review.  Please 
reply to Michelle's specific queries in paragraph 3 of her e-mail.

Paul-

Following your review of the attached e-mail traffic, please provide us with 
the Japanese legal perspective on undertaking these types of activities.  
Also, based on your experience, inform us as to how testing of this nature 
may be perceived in the Japanese market.

Best regards,

John

John,

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice 
mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of 
issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits 
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for 
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain 
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there 
another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references 
from prior employers, etc.)?  

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that 
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the 
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine 
how to proceed.

Michelle

Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for 
your consideration.  I am unsure as to the types of testing contemplated, but 
want to ensure that such activities are permitted under Enron's policy.

Your comments on the attached agreement would also be appreciated.  

Thanks,

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to 
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes 
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment 
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed 
to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our 
use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you 
review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also 
appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with 
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it 
in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

With the e-mail transmission (using .pdf files), we'll need you or someone 
else in Enron to sign a document similar to the attached letter. Please read 
it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we fill in all the
