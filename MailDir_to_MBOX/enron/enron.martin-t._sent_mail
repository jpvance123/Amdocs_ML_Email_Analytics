If you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required Enron to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep Enron whole.  Any thoughts?

The EEX deal is a pre-pay deal.  It is not a VPP deal.  It is a financial deal only, between an Enron company called Bob West Treasury and EEX.  It is a financial deal only - no physical vols.

In a completely separate financial hedge, EEX had hedged some gas vols with Fred Lagrasta [ENA].  Last December, EEX called wanting to EFP some of these vols.  This is completely between Fred/ENA and EEX.  It has nothing to do with our pre-pay.

David/Tom, I would say the decision if this deal stays with you or goes to AEP is up to Fred.  I just spoke with Fred and he said that they did just one EFP with EEX - some south Texas [Thompsonville] vols.  He is uncertain as to the term, but off the top of his head, he thought it was for 2 or 3 years.  He said it didn't matter to him if we kept this EFP or if it went to AEP, as long as we were paid - it is way in the money.  This EFP should be in Tom's book and if it is decided to go to AEP, then this needs to be reflected in the final purchase price to AEP, since it is in the money.  BOTTOM LINE:  it doesn't matter to Fred, as long as we are paid for this.

If you have any questions re this EFP, please discuss with Fred.
Joan

Just to confirm ... the gas we are recieving at various fixed prices on deal N60753.3 is going to AEP.  This should constitute the EFP's, I believe.  Does either of you have any of the original minibooks for the VPP?

Are we going to restructure the EEX deal?  If not, I need to go ahead and add these volumes to the schedule going to AEP.

Subject:	Gas Supply proposal for EDF

Hello Tom, I hope bid week is over, and you can breathe now?I met PACE Global Energy yesterday to talk about the EDF RFP, and I think it looks much better now:

1.- Term: They are planning on having 3 interconnections into 3 different pipelines (Tetco, PG&E and Coral Mexico Pipeline), so they think the banks can get comfortable with less than 25 years of supply, because the 3 interconnections lowers their risk of not getting fuel supply in the future. They are asking now to a proposal of minimum 5 years, and upto 12 if we can make it. So they will be taking the risk of not having a fuel supply that matches de 25 year Power Purchase Agreement.

2.- The Points of Sale will be in the U.S. Mexico Border, so we will not have to get an export permit of any sort.

3.- Swing: This is going to be a base load plant, that will be dispatched around 90% on a yearly average.  However CFE has the right to take zero power at their full discretion, so Edf does not wsant to take the risk of not being dispatched and not being able to swing down to zero during the 25 years of the gas supply.  However, the plant will most certainly displace other less efficient plants in the first 10 years, so that such risk is much lower. In our proposal we can include either zero swing or which ever we feel we are the most competitive. They will evaluate whether such risk could be taken by them. 

4.- Modifying Swing every 2 years.  They believe that in the long run (25 years), the dispatching rules or conditions of the plant could change. So they want to have the option to review the swing every 2 years. Can we price this optionality ? Is there a re-purchase of such optionality in the market ? 

5.- Resale formula. They need us to include a daily re-sale fomula for the gas not taken.

6.- Other Provisions: We need to review the other provisions in the RFP and tell them which ones can we comply with and which ones we don't. 

I am faxing you the entire RFP, together with the latest letter we received from them. Please give me a call whenevr you have a chance.   

Best regards.

Yes if they are for Las Vegas.  There was a team building trip approved by John at the beginning of the year.

Are you planning to put together the monthly EOL volume actuals versus performance targets as described in the 2001 Plan?

Pagers, Cell Phones, etc should be cancelled as of closing which I believe to be June 1st, I will let you know if there are any changes.  When I arrange for new traders I will need computers for them.  I have talked to Ed and Brian and they have agreed to give me 4 computers back prior to closing.  I anticipate needing 2 of them prior to the end of the month.  How much lead time do you need to have them brought down here?  Did you get the message out about customer entertainment?

Thanks,

Tom

Yes, this deal should go to AEP with the HPL transaction.  The reason there are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes priced at gas daily.  At any rate there is no way to know in forward months what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums.  If you have any further questions let me know.

Thanks,

Tom

Attached are the rates for April.  I know the King Ranch and Agua Dulce rates to HSC are a mute point with the work on the A/S Line.  Needless to say we will be a seller either during Bidweek and/or on a daily basis on A/S South.

I have asked Dave to set up a meeting with you and Barbara on this subject.  I thought there were exclusions relative to EOL transactions and points that do not directly impact HPL.  The problem for me is that if I want to do terms deals in these locations now I want to be able to keep them as ENA and not transfer them with the HPL sale.  Let's talk as soon as possible so I can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ENA now and after the close.

Thanks,

Tom

I received notice today that Elsa Villareal , Gary Lamphier and Ed Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:

1 Lead Physical Trader
1 Physical Trader
1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)

1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator
1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator

I met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.
I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.

I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.

Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.

The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.

Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.

I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.

Thanks,

Tom

Thanks for the info.  I wanted to pick your brain about cars for Mom and Dad.  My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.

  I only considered CR "Recomended " cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.

Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.  My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis and the Park Avenue first and see if they come close to meeting Mom and Dad's needs.

Any Thoughts?

Love,

Tom

Everything other than the LDC business has been done in the name of HPL even if not physically located on HPL.  I want to start intiating transactions that are not physically on HPL in the name of ENA so they would not have to transfer as part of the sale (ie. Waha, Katy Tailgate and Carthaqe Hub).  I understand Dave Baumbach has arranged a meeting with you and Jeff Hodge to discuss.

Thanks,

I am generally available in the afternoons after 3:00.  Have your assistant schedule some time either this week or next so we can talk about the Wellhead Book.

Thanks,

Tom

Gary,


I don't think that we will be using a weather hedge this season.  The hedges that we have used before have worked well because we have had very warm winters and have correlated very well with Entex takes.  I am not as confident in the correlation in a closer to normal temperature environment which is the forecast for this winter.

Patrick,

I forwarded the information regarding the variable costs of transportation to Ed McMichael as you requested.  The storage has no forward value, it was included to take advantage of opportunities as they occur.  I want to be clear AGAIN about how the transportation transaction should be accrual upside and not booked as MTM as our view is that the spreads will compress over time and any spread value that exists from the curves today will likely go away or be significantly reduced over time .  I thought Lavorado was very clear that he did not want to book MTM value against these deals.  Am I missing something?

Brian,

As we discussed the other day, there are several key commercial, logistics, risk management and gas control personnel that we must have to run our business this winter.  I have heard that some of our people are being pursued by outside companies in light of the potential HPL sale.  The key people that we want to ensure stay around through the transition are:

Ed Gottlob
Elsa Villareal
James McKay
Gary Hanks
Darren Farmer
Stacey Neuweiler
Pat Clines
Dave Baumbach
O' Neal Winfree


Let me know what you think.

Tom

Nick, I am short traders this week and generally do not like to meet during the hours in which the NYMEX is open.  Can we move this meeting to the afternoon(after 3:00), preferalbly when Schwieger is back in town?  If this meeting must occur as scheduled I plan on sending Ed in my place.

Thanks,
Tom

Greg,

I am short traders this week and Schwieger is out until Thursday afternoon.  Is there any way that we can move this meeting to Friday afternoon.  Jim and I would like to be involved but we can not make it Wednesday morning.  If the meeting can not be changed then Ed will go in our behalf.

Thanks,
Tom
