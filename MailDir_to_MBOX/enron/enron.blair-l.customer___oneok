Ladies & Gentlemen:

Here is the spreadsheet that Ken plants to attach to his letter to ONEOK re the Fisher Roc lock-up period.  If this causes anyone any heartburn, please let me know ASAP.  
Again, I'd like to get out the letter from Ken, with this spreadsheet attached, this afternoon.

Many thanks.

Britt

Everyone:
 
Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:
 
1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.
 
2.  We are missing an "an" in the first sentence, right before the word "incident"; that will be corrected.
 
3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.
 
4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.
 
5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?
 
 6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.
 
Many thanks.
 
Britt

Subject:	Re: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Response to ONEOK's request for a Special Test

The ONEOK letter mentions testing the "chromatograph" as well as the meters.  We may need to detail what exactly is "testing the chromatograph".  They also want to test "temperature and pressure sampling probes" this may need to be clarified.  

I also questioned the need to send the meters to the Netherlands, are there ways to nullify the uncertainity effect of the flow lab?  Could we use the TransCanada facility?  I have called George Kneisley to see if he has details regarding a document he sent out where the flow labs were "trued up" to match each other.  Ken, do you remember anything like that?  If we need to send the meters to the Netherlands I have no problem with that, I just wondered of it was necessary.

On the second page, in the paragraph the starts with "Third", I think we need to change the statement regarding "matched pairs".  We did not flow calibrate the meters with the intent of being matched pairs.  We only matched the upstream piping, with the Gallagher Flow Conditioner, and the meter.  I agree that the condition of the gas may have introduced some contaminants into the Rich inlet meter, and if that happened then those same contaminants may have been introduced into the Rich outlet meter.  Should we approach this with the idea that if the Rich inlet test just as it did in the Netherlands test, then there is no reason to test the Rich outlet?  If there is a difference in the flow test on the Rich inlet, then we would insist on testing the Rich outlet.  This is just an idea, it may be best to test Rich inlet and Rich outlet no matter what the findings.  Attached is a small revision that needs worksmithing.  Thanks.

Lynn,

I sent this request for payment to Delaine in June.  I followed up (via an e-mail I can't find) in July.  Delaine replied to my July follow-up saying she was having trouble getting a hold of someone (internally) she needed to talk with.  I really would appreciate your calling her!

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles
Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the
Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton
Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for
picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids
removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage
attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok
monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the
condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table
below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.
This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for
removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease #
71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler
contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is
water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok
accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and
refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement
and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact
condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing
Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of
liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates
that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.
Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from
Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this
matter is appreciated.

Thanks

	I asked Ken Cessac to call Jerry Knight, who is the administrative assistant that John Sommer asked Ken to call to get daily PTR from ONEOK.  Knight had been sending Ken daily PTR information on a once-weekly basis through September, but then stopped.  I asked Ken to ask Knight the obvious question:  why did he stop sending Ken the daily PTR?  Ken did so today and was told that Terry Spencer told Knight to stop sending Ken the information.  Knight didn't say why he had been told that.  Knight told Ken that he would now tell Spencer that Ken had made inquiry about the stoppage of the daily PTR.  Ken wondered whether Spencer did this to see if Ken noticed and objected to the lack of daily PTR.  Weird.

	Ken's letter of today's date regarding the second measurement incident has gone out by telefax to ONEOK.  Many thanks to all who responded on that.

	ONEOK's response to our first letter, which I mentioned in a previous e-mail, has or will shortly be distributed.

	I'll keep you advised.

	Britt

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

	Joe,

	Thanks for your help.  If you could please get me telefaxes for both Delaine Kurth and Kim Hardeman, as well as an address for Kim Hardeman(or whoever has taken her place),  I would appreciate it. (Lynn, thanks for the suggestion on the names).

	Britt

	P.S. to everyone else:  Does everyone agree we need to send the proposed Fisher Roc outage letter to Delaine and Kim?  Is there anyone else we need to include on the ONEOK side?

	Ken Cessac reported to me today concerning a problem with Northern's chromatograph at the Bushton Plant that occurred on 9/19 after a routine annual replacement of calibration gas by ETS, and that was fixed yesterday, although Ken needs to review the fix.  In a nutshell, the problem appears likely to have caused the volumes to be off for the period of time at issue; it is yet to be determined whether the Btu's per MMBtu will be off.  Angela Mendez apparently caught this when certain values started repeating themselves.  I am told that a similar problem was experienced when the chromatograph was first installed years ago, but thought to have been fixed.  
	
	Once Ken has finished his review and I have spoken with Rick Kile, we can draft the appropriate letter.  

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

	Today I was advised by Lynn and Harry that Harry received on Friday from ONEOK a letter dated November 1, advising, in brief, that since they had received no response to their previous letters of September 28 and October 25 (regarding our two measurement incidents) that they have prepared an imbalance statement for September that uses Plant PTR.  Lynn asked if we should input their numbers, as today is the deadline for doing so.  I instructed her not to input the ONEOK numbers and to continue to use ours.  If ONEOK called about our response to their letter of November 1, I asked Lynn and Harry to advise that a written response would be forthcoming.

	I will try to get copies of the letter and attachment circulated.  For those of you who receive the copies, please note that only the letter and first page of the attachments were prepared and sent by ONEOK, and the second page was prepared internally by Harry.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

Dave heard back from Terry Spencer of OneOk today that OneOk has changed its position on a couple of key issues.  First, Terry indicated that OneOk now agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past period.  They agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement, and that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect.  It is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is, but any change is significant on this issue.  Second, Terry indicated that OneOk is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the April-May issue, and, implicitly, the issue of whether the meters are OK going forward. This is also a big change, as OneOk has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last Fall.  

Spencer indicated OneOk was drafting a letter that would clarify their position.  In light of that, and of the apparent progress Dave made, Stan has agreed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter.  Once Dave gets it, we'll all take a look and decide the next step.  Thanks.  DF

Please review the attached letter to ONEOK and the supporting Imbalance Statement, Dollar Valuation Statement and ONEOK PTR Shrink Balance and Interest Calculation detail report.  Once I get the "go-ahead" from you, I will Email this package to Delaine Kurth.

We still prefer to send this package out today, so please get back to me this afternoon if possible.  If we do not hear from everyone, we will still send it to Delaine as someone from each of your staff has already reviewed and agreed to the language in the letter.
Rick

A meeting has been scheduled for 1 PM on Wednesday, October 31 with members of the management team from the Bushton OneOK process facility. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the logistics involved in the removal of the rich stream inlet meter and any additional meters as determined prior to this date. The discussion will be focused on the operational and physical requirements of removing the meter/meters for test and not on why the test is being conducted.

The meeting will take place in the basement of the OneOK office at Bushton.

Please let me know if conflicts occur with this date.

I just talked with Mark Walton x34864 (He is working Debbie Moseley's account in her absence - she is expected to return tomorrow) and he now understands the issue.  Since we have been billing ONEOK based upon water tickets left by the truck driver (rather than the revenue statement ONEOK receives for it's condensate like we use at all other points), I think they want to see where our gallons came from.  I believe the field has been faxing the water tickets to Debbie and she has been basing her invoice on them.  Mark will look into what we have been using today and will let me know.  He with also talk to their accounting to determine if they just want this data for after the fact backup or if they are holding up payment.

I received the following information from Oneok concerning the missing Mt. Jesus payments.  Lisa Voth, the condensate accountant for Oneok, stated she need the volume statements from Debbie Mosely reflecting the Mt.Jesus volumes and production periods.  Dan, do you have access to Debbie's spreadsheet statements?  If I can be of any assistance, please let me know.
Lynn, I left a message with Sherry Rodgers requesting all stranger gas statements dating back six months.

Each month I receive run statements from third party vendors showing volumes
of condensate purchased during the month, I also receive field tickets to
match up to the statements.  In regards to the Mt. Jesus location, we do not
receive such documentation.  We have no way to distinguish if any volumes
were purchased from Mt. Jesus since we do not receive statements, nor
tickets.  Our trader, Jon Hanna received a spreadsheet showing volumes NNG
believes we owe for the Mt. Jesus location.  Can you send me the
documentation NNG is using to come up with these volumes.

Thank you,

	Just to clarify Britt's comments.  Harry is using NNG's numbers for total imbalance.  To split the
	imbalance among the third party shippers, we will continue to use Oneok's allocation of actual
	volumes.  The variance between Oneok and NNG will go to the Oneok imbalance to tie to NNG's

	Harry today received the original of the November 1 letter to him from Sherry Rogers, which, again, takes the position that we agreed to the use of Plant PTR for September because of our lack of a reply to date to their response letters to our notices of the two September measurement incidents, even though Northern clearly stated its position in Northern's notice letters.  However, the attachment to the original letter now includes the September 2001 imbalance statement, using plant PTR instead of Northern's meters.

	I will have this circulated to everyone by fax or hand-delivery.

Keep in mind also, that if the variance was or could be used,  it is based off of the total volume to the plant, not a comparison of their Ptr # to the measured number.  Charlie has calculated this a number of times.   MK

What happens next is that Rick Craig is meeting with John Sommers soon to discuss the April-May numbers.  OneOk has not given any specific reason they disagree with our April/May numbers.  If they admit their only basis for disagreeing  with our numbers is that the "variance" was big in April or May, our answer to them will be that size of the variance between metered numbers and PTR no longer matters.  That issue was decided in our favor in the arbitration.  In fact Rick, your reference to a .5% variance "threshold" is confusing to me because there is no threshold--.5% or any % in the agreement.  Our meters govern no matter how big or little the so called variance gets, unless Oneok calls a special test and proves a malfunction.  Britt is talking to Rick, and Rick's role will be to simply listen to Sommers on this issue--with no debate or argument at the meeting.  We will convene after Rick's meeting to discuss whether to go to court to enforce the arbitration award.  DF

Subject:	ONEOK's July PTR Statement

ONEOK sent us their Bushton PTR statement for July 2001 this afternoon.  The good news is they used Northern's ultrasonic meters as the basis for their calculation.  The % variance between their calculated plant PTR and our measured plant PTR volumes was only .033% (three hundredths of one percent).  

Since the variance was less than 1/2 of one percent, they are bound by the Bushton Plant PTR Agreement to use the ultrasonic metered volumes. We're pleased the variance is so minor.  However, we cannot determine whether ONEOK is using our metered volumes because of the arbitrator's ruling or whether it is simply because the variance is below the .5% tolerance.  

As you will recall, June 2001 was also within the .5% tolerance and ONEOK used our metered volumes.  April and May 2001 were outside of this tolerance and ONEOK used their calculated plant PTR method as the basis for calculating the PTR and is disputing our measurement for these two months.

Where do we go from here?

Tangi and you did on our post-hearing briefs. =20

Of even more significance,  the panel specifically noted KN's course of per=

the panel rejected ONEOK's argument that ONEOK had never "accepted" the met=

of this litigation, and it became a centerpiece argument for us. With their=
 and your fine work (and the unbelievable hours all of you put in, late at =
night, early in the morning, on the weekends, and frequently on an emergenc=
y basis, with little or no notice), you made ONEOK's attorneys very unhappy=
 with your testimony at the hearing.  I loved it.

This was a team effort, and congratulations are due all the way around.  It=

Britt,

We have done a thorough analysis of ONEOK's calculation of pre-judgment int=
erest and are in agreement with their amount due Northern of ($56,097.69). =
=20

The reason why the interest is due Northern (in apparent contradiction to N=
orthern being instructed to pay ONEOK approximately $1.2 million dollars fo=
r the retroactive correction of the meter factor error) is tied to the calc=
ulation of the accumulated interest.  Since this is a dollar-valued OBA, ea=
ch month's imbalance was valued at the appropriate monthly index price and =
a 6% simple interest calculation was applied from that month until the curr=
ent period.  We had a significant amount of monthly imbalances due Northern=
 early in the review period that carried forward very large credit interest=
 balances due us.  For example, July 1998 had a credit imbalance due NNG va=
lued at ($753,541.27).  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for 99=
7 days (September 1998 through June 2001) resulted in a credit interest amo=
unt due NNG of ($123,498.19).  For comparison purposes, contrasting with th=
is month is a large debit imbalance due ONEOK of $769,407.44 for the month =
of December 2000.  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for only 11=
3 days (February 2001 through June 2001) resulted in a debit interest amoun=
t due ONEOK of $14,292.01.  By summarizing these two months, we have an imb=
alance value that is due ONEOK of $15,866.17 with a corresponding net inter=
est valuation due Northern of ($109,206.18).  This scenario plays out for t=
he entire review period netting to a cumulative credit amount due Northern =
of ($56,097.69).

If you would like to review the calculations in detail, please let me know =
and I will forward the spreadsheet to you.

We probably need someone from operations to go with Oneok to pull this sample.  Mt. Jesus drip is at pipeline pressure, and there are safety issues with sample collecting at the site.  I could probably attend (if scheduled in advance), if you want, also an Ashland team member should probably be there.  Thanks.

Oneok has every right to sample the location themselves and should.  I feel compelled to allow them some time to do so, but also feel put upon, given they have had over a year to do so but instead have chosen to stonewall us!!!!  If you could keep the heat on (in a firm but empathetic way) that would be good.  Neubauer wants NNG/Oneok issues to be discovered, defined, and addressed (or if necessary arbitrated) quickly rather than allowing them to languish.

On another note, if Delaine has not been the problem who has been.  I would have less sympathy for whoever has been dragging their feet (probably wishing this would just go away) than I do for Delaine who seems to be just trying to get to the bottom of it.  I sense she is hitting the same stonewall (and I'll call you back run around)we have.

Lynn,

Thanks for your help getting this pushed along.  Shouldn't we take the approach that payment to Northern is expected immediately once Oneok verifies the liquid is condensate.  Whether they ever reach agreement with their hauler or not is not germane to paying us.  We have been pressing Oneok about Mt. Jesus since April of 2000 and provided them with a sample analysis (taken by us) September 30, 2000!  You can see by the trail of e-mails below, they seem to brush us off about once a month.

Thanks

If determined that the liquids do have condensate in them, we will pursue
retroactive settlement with the current hauler.  Hopefully we will bring

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles
Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the
Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton
Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for
picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids
removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage
attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok
monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the
condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table
below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.
This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for
removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease #
71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler
contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is
water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok
accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and
refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement
and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact
condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing
Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of
liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates
that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.
Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from
Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this
matter is appreciated.

Thanks

Drew, I won't be available until around 5pm today.  In lieu of a meeting let me leave you with some comments.

?	I have no objection to the "special test" being conducted at the CEESI facilities in Ventura, Ia.  As far as I know they are adequate. But, we would want to have an expert look at them first.  i.e., Instomet and Ken Cessac.
?	When a meter is removed from service at the Rich/Lean Inlet/Outlet then the Rich/Lean plant(s) would have to go down until that meter is tested and reinstalled.  I would assume that they would want to have one outage for all four meters and the total down time for the plant might be several days.
?	Northern will have to restrict C6+ again during this outage.
?	There is no spare meter(s) or spool for any of the Bushton meters.  If OneOK were willing to reimburse NNG (regardless of test outcome), NNG would be willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct this test with minimal impact to plant processing.  There would still be an outage of the Bushton Plant but probably only a couple of days.

I'd like to get the above group together to discuss our response to ONeOk's letter calling for a special test. The agreement requires us to "cooperate" with OneOk when a special test is called, and there are a number of issues we will need to cooperate on, including what to do for measurement while the meter is removed, which outfit to use to test the  meter, and what the standards for testing the meter should be.  Emily--pls get a meeting set up for today if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF

	Attached for everyone's review is Ken Cessac's proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the chromatograph malfunction.  I have included Ken and Rick Kile's comments.  Given that today is Ken's last day in the office before he leaves on vacation, and that I have a 3:00 meeting on an unrelated matter that may take all afternoon, I am with apologies requesting that all additional comments be given to me by 2:00 p.m. today.

	I greatly appreciate your help.

     Britt, to answer #5, Kim Hardman and/or Delaine Kurth may be added to the cc on the letter.  The reason I mention Delaine
    is Jerry Knight (who works for Delaine) is the person that has been calling Robert Benningfield asking for the
    status of the 12 - 16 adjustment.  Thanks. Lynn

Good letter.  One suggestion--our insistence that the meters and the chromatograph "were reliably and accurately . . ." doing their respective things sounds kind of defensive.  In fact, we don't know what they were doing because we have no record of the data they sent to the ROC, right?  Would it be less adversarial to simply say "the ultrasonic meters . . .continued to operate normally. . ." and to say the same for the chromatograph?  We do know that the meters and chromatograph did continue to operate because they had not shut down, right?  Also, I'd like to better understand the formula we're using to alibi the data.  What are "the time periods of normal operation"?  Was that ratio developed from our data from Sep. 1-12?  IF so, why does the formula create such a significant increase in the variance?  Thanks. df

Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc


Everyone:
 
Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:
 
1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.
 
2.  We are missing an "an" in the first sentence, right before the word "incident"; that will be corrected.
 
3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.
 
4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.
 
5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?
 
 6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.
 
Many thanks.
 
Britt

	One of the to-do's at the end of our recent conference call was to determine whether we wanted to do an end-run around ONEOK's desire to use the PTR system during the special test by buying or leasing a meter to use in place of the rich inlet meter.  Don Hawkins just called to advise that Phil Lowry has authorized spending $100,000 to buy a new meter and associated piping for this purpose.  We will also be spending the money to have it flow tested.  Charlie Thompson is now contacting Instromet to see if they will sell us one for that price and how quickly we can get delivery.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

Oneok sends Northern helium volumes monthly attached to their Third Party Bushton Allocation Report. Oneok ran a test for November's Production which produced some volume (approximately 1000 mcf per Sherry Rogers /Oneok) to be reflected on their statement for November's production. Market Services will keep you undated each month by e-mail on any actual helium produced at the Bushton Plant.

If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 853-6600.

	Ken and Kile, 

	Please see the attached proposed draft letter.  I need to fill in one blank, but it is otherwise complete, subject to your thoughts.  I will try and get a copy of Sherry Rogers' letter to Harry Woodson of November 1 by fax to you both.

	Britt

	P.S. to Lynn and Harry:  is it alright with you for Ken to basically be replying to the letter to Harry?  Do we also need a "me, too" letter from Harry?

Dave Neubauer received a voice mail message today from Terry Spencer in which Terry stated that ONEOK will be forwarding the withheld mmbtu reimbursement payments for the condensate removed from Northern's Mt. Jesus drip.  Dan, please notify the rest of us when payment is received.

As an aside, note that last week CP Energy and Touchstone Trucking met with our Ron Brickman and others after identifying themselves as, a new condensate marketer and drip hauler retained by ONEOK to begin collecting the Mt. Jesus, Fowler, Sublette locations.  It is our understanding that these folks were brought in by Oneok on a trial basis to collect drip at locations that have been a "problem" for/between Oneok and its current hauler.

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.  This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease # 71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.  

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.  Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.

Thanks

Charlie

the C6+ concern I raised continued to be somewhat of an issue last Feb-May when we were only flowing gas to the rich side for processing.  OPS needs to determine if it could be an issue and whether it should be mentioned and what we expect if it does become  an issue.  Mary Kay

	Dear Phil, Mary Kay, Dave, Don, Shelley and Lynn,

	Drew asked me to send this latest version of Dave's proposed special test response letter to each of you for your review and authority to send out.  I have received comments from Mary Kay, Don, Drew, and Rick, and hope I adequately captured them.  If I have missed something critical, of course please let me know immediately.  

	Mary Kay will note that I said nothing about a potential C6+ problem that she has mentioned in her comments.  That is because I thought I was told that all the gas that we are now flowing and would reasonably expect to flow to Bushton could be routed through the rich stream and measured by one pair of meters.  If I understand Mary Kay's point, the C6+ problem arises only if you have so much unprocessed gas coming in you have to bypass the plant and take the unprocessed gas straight to the customers, which might cause downstream freeze-offs, etc.  Mary Kay, if the C6+ problem is a different problem, let me know.  Also, it is absolutely critical that we feel confident that we can send all the unprocessed gas through the rich stream for the indefinite future.  Can the right person tell us with authority that this is the case?

	We are proposing NMI as our choice of testing facility.  I know that we very concerned about the effect in any future litigation about testing at CEESI, given Steve Caldwell's role in the past arbitration, and are considering using the Transcanada testing facility.  Bill Frasier has recently mentioned that the Transcanada test facility may have a substantial problem with swirl in the gas flow upstream of the test meters.  Further, if we use any test facility but NMI's, we face the risk of having the inherent bias of that test facility being thrown at us as evidence of meter inaccuracy with regard to past periods.  

	ONEOK will reply that CEESI is by far the lowest cost alternative among CEESI, Transcanada, and NMI, given that our equipment is apparently within trucking distance of the CEESI lab.  Bill Frasier has kindly agreed to review the various cost-scenarios will hopes to have an estimate to us (comparing the cost of flow testing at CEEI vs. Transcanada vs. NMI) by tomorrow afternoon.  I assume that CEESI will probably be the least expensive and least time-consuming alternative.  

	A good solution to the testing facility issue was suggested by Dave, with Grant's additional refinement,  which is to have an agreement that if we use CEESI, then neither Caldwell nor any of the CEESI employees could be called as fact or expert witnesses in any subsequent litigation.  Further, Grant suggested that we also require that the inherent bias in a certain percentage be factored out of any calculation of inaccuracy.

	As part of his analysis, Frasier will also be looking at one-pair testing scenarios vs. two-pair testing scenarios.  The one-pair testing scenario is item #6 in the current draft; the two-pair testing scenario was item #7 in the last draft, which I have deleted in this draft.  The reason for deleting it is primarily cost.  I have not been able to think of any argument under which we could reasonably require ONEOK to be liable for all the costs of special testing the lean meters.  Drew and I discussed that the flow testing of the rich meters may answer a lot of problems; the swapping out of the original lean meters onto the rich line in the process may also give us some valuable information.

	One risk of the one-pair scenario is that we think the lean stream meters may actually be measuring slightly in ONEOK's favor.  If we put the lean stream meters on the rich stream and the variance between plant loss as measured by our meters and the plant PTR Meters in fact significantly decreases, ONEOK may use this as evidence that the lean stream meters are measuring more accurately than the rich stream meters.  We may then be in a position of being forced to ask for a special test of the remaining pair of meters.   At this point, I am thinking that we will deal with that problem if it in fact arises.

	Apologies for the lengthy e-mail; I await your comments.

	Britt

	Gentlemen:

	Steve Herber asked this morning that I send to him and Dave Neubauer a copy of the arbitration award in this matter, given that Stan Horton has taken the position that no further business will be done with ONEOK until the measurement issue is straightened out, and that Steve and Dave are in negotiations with ONEOK right now.

	Per my discussion with Steve, I will send to him a three-ring binder headed "CONFIDENTIAL:  Northern v. ONEOK" and that contains the Measurement Agreement, the Operating Agreement (whose dispute resolution language is incorporated into the Measurement Agreement)  and the arbitration award.  Given that I think Kathy R. has that information in Omaha, I would ask that she do the same for Dave Neubauer (Kathy, could you call to confirm that you have the documents and can do this?).

	Please treat the binder as highly confidential, as we arbitrated under a confidentiality agreement.  That goes for any copy of the arbitration award in anyone's possession.

	If you are aware of anyone else who should receive such a binder, please let me know.

	Britt

	Stan, the Bushton Team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and substantial risk to Northern in accepting OneOk's suggestion that we rewrite the Bushton Measurement Agreement to operate like the OneOk-Kinder Morgan Scott City measurement agreement.  We are reluctant to incorporate the PTR formula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current Measurement Agreement.  The following are talking points that Dave Neubauer will use today in a conversation with Terry Spencer, who is Steve Winston's boss.  Since Winston's proposal (which I sent to you by email last week) was a draft and has never been formally sent to us, we decided that having Dave deliver our message to Terry made more sense than sending a letter or elevating the issue to your and John Gibson's level.  However, if Gibson calls you and raises the issue of their proposal, the following points contain our message.  

	Spencer may agree in the call with Dave to reconcile the April and May imbalance based on our metered numbers.  If not, Britt has prepared a demand letter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling.  I believe that Gibson indicated that he'd be calling you back this week to talk about this matter, so your conversation should take place before we send the demand letter. I'll forward the demand letter for your review separately. 
 		
	On the other proposal from OneOk that I forwarded to you last week (relating to operational changes designed to allow OneOk to get the helium plant running again), we have made some minor modifications and are sending the counterproposal back to OneOk.  We expect to get that deal in place with them soon.  This is a good development for them, and with little or no risk to us, and should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of their measurment proposal.   

	Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. DF



 

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a "BTU measurement error" (i.e., when the chromatograph malfunctions).   

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the Oneok meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration. 

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a "special test" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.

Below are the talking points that I'd propose we run by Stan and then have Stan use with John Gibson and Dave use with Terry Spencer.  Once everyone is OK with these, I'll email to Stan and Dave with a brief explanation that our recommendation is that we politely decline the suggestion from Steve Winston that we voluntarily rewrite the measurement agreement.  

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.

Angela,

Please accept this as written documentation of the lower than normal flows to the Oneok extraction plant.

On September 10, 2001, at 23:10 PLT, Unit #29 dropped a valve in it's #12 power cylinder causing it to be declared not available. As a result we were unable to maintain the normal flow rates to Oneok. This situation existed until September 12, 2001 at 15:35 PLT, when the unit was returned to service.

If you have further questions or need more information please cantact me or Casey Winter at (620)562-4325.

Mary, as you requested, on yesterday  I have added January 1998 thru May 1998 affidavit volumes.
I have also made adjustments to June and July 1998 volumes.  I didn't multiply the volumes by
the correct number of days for these two months.  If you have any questions or concerns please 
feel free to give me a call.

	Dear Phil, Mary Kay, Dave, Don, Shelley and Lynn,

	Drew asked me to send this latest version of Dave's proposed special test response letter to each of you for your review and authority to send out.  I have received comments from Mary Kay, Don, Drew, and Rick, and hope I adequately captured them.  If I have missed something critical, of course please let me know immediately.  

	Mary Kay will note that I said nothing about a potential C6+ problem that she has mentioned in her comments.  That is because I thought I was told that all the gas that we are now flowing and would reasonably expect to flow to Bushton could be routed through the rich stream and measured by one pair of meters.  If I understand Mary Kay's point, the C6+ problem arises only if you have so much unprocessed gas coming in you have to bypass the plant and take the unprocessed gas straight to the customers, which might cause downstream freeze-offs, etc.  Mary Kay, if the C6+ problem is a different problem, let me know.  Also, it is absolutely critical that we feel confident that we can send all the unprocessed gas through the rich stream for the indefinite future.  Can the right person tell us with authority that this is the case?

	We are proposing NMI as our choice of testing facility.  I know that we very concerned about the effect in any future litigation about testing at CEESI, given Steve Caldwell's role in the past arbitration, and are considering using the Transcanada testing facility.  Bill Frasier has recently mentioned that the Transcanada test facility may have a substantial problem with swirl in the gas flow upstream of the test meters.  Further, if we use any test facility but NMI's, we face the risk of having the inherent bias of that test facility being thrown at us as evidence of meter inaccuracy with regard to past periods.  

	ONEOK will reply that CEESI is by far the lowest cost alternative among CEESI, Transcanada, and NMI, given that our equipment is apparently within trucking distance of the CEESI lab.  Bill Frasier has kindly agreed to review the various cost-scenarios will hopes to have an estimate to us (comparing the cost of flow testing at CEEI vs. Transcanada vs. NMI) by tomorrow afternoon.  I assume that CEESI will probably be the least expensive and least time-consuming alternative.  

	A good solution to the testing facility issue was suggested by Dave, with Grant's additional refinement,  which is to have an agreement that if we use CEESI, then neither Caldwell nor any of the CEESI employees could be called as fact or expert witnesses in any subsequent litigation.  Further, Grant suggested that we also require that the inherent bias in a certain percentage be factored out of any calculation of inaccuracy.

	As part of his analysis, Frasier will also be looking at one-pair testing scenarios vs. two-pair testing scenarios.  The one-pair testing scenario is item #6 in the current draft; the two-pair testing scenario was item #7 in the last draft, which I have deleted in this draft.  The reason for deleting it is primarily cost.  I have not been able to think of any argument under which we could reasonably require ONEOK to be liable for all the costs of special testing the lean meters.  Drew and I discussed that the flow testing of the rich meters may answer a lot of problems; the swapping out of the original lean meters onto the rich line in the process may also give us some valuable information.

	One risk of the one-pair scenario is that we think the lean stream meters may actually be measuring slightly in ONEOK's favor.  If we put the lean stream meters on the rich stream and the variance between plant loss as measured by our meters and the plant PTR Meters in fact significantly decreases, ONEOK may use this as evidence that the lean stream meters are measuring more accurately than the rich stream meters.  We may then be in a position of being forced to ask for a special test of the remaining pair of meters.   At this point, I am thinking that we will deal with that problem if it in fact arises.

	Apologies for the lengthy e-mail; I await your comments.

	Britt

FYI.  If you hadn't already heard, sounds like ONEOK has retained a new condensate/water hauler (CP Energy?).  Just a heads up since this may impact your receipt of information (revenue statements and/or run tickets) regarding the quantities of liquid removed from our facilities.

Subject:	Condensate Hauling

As most of you are now aware of, OneOk has hired a new trucking company to haul off the pipeline drips and condensate tanks at our locations where drip is contained in the southwest Kansas area.
There has been an appointment set to meet with this new trucking company representative on Monday, Sept. 24th at the Liberal Region office complex at 1:00 p.m.
The main focus will be for the teams involved to show the vendor where these locations are that have previously been picked up by WEGO, and to make arrangements for them to review previous schedules to haul these condensates. What they have requested from the teams are maps to each point along with driving directions that are specific to each location. It comes to my mind that maybe we could provide them with a copy of our emergency response driving directions that the teams should have on hand.
It was also brought to my attention, from my management, that this tasks needs to be handed off to the region operations management people so that they may coordinate the activities to their needs and schedules. It was also discussed that proper safety and procedure practices need be recognized by this new company which will be entering ETS facilities to provide their services for OneOk.
This would also be a prime opportunity to request that driver "run tickets" be left at all locations that drip is removed from. This would not only provide us with audit trail material for the future, but can give us documentation for comparisons at the places where we have load-out meters installed.
With these suggestions considered, maybe we can go forward from here with our continued services and work ethics with OneOk to provide a more positive customer relationship.
Thanks you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.

RB


P.S.     All teams do not need to have a rep. present at this meeting. Randy Howard, myself and a few others that I have asked to provide the maps from are all that will be needed.

Jim,
Here is another matter I need to really push, a letter demanding payment of the Mt. Jesus condensate reimbursement short payments.  Please review this letter and give me your observations, suggestions. 

Lynn,
Any better name than Spencer to send this to?  

Dan/Mark
Can you get me updated numbers?  Here is a spreadsheet that Debbie provided to me.

After discussions with Daniel Ind. Rick Kile determined that the problem was caused by a bad version of Daniel configuration software.    Daniel informed Rick that version 1.43 is corrupt and should not be used.  The software has a bug which can toggle the USER/STANDARD setup values when edits are made to the unit.  On September 19th the calibration standard was changed which requires the new calibration components be entered into the chromatograph.  These edits were made using the version 1.43 of Daniel configuration software.  Due to the problems with the software, some of the components configuration changed from STD to USER.  This change effects the communications between the Fisher ROC and the chromatograph which prevented the ROC from receiving some of the gas quality information.  Based on our research and testing we feel that this problem did not effect the chromatographs internal calculations.   

Since the only items effected by this was some of the components and not the BTU or specific gravity, this problem had very little effect on the volume calculations.  For example I changed the methane and Nitrogen values by 1 percent and the calculated volume only changed by 0.07%.  Since the BTU and specific gravity were recorded correctly we can thus use them as a reference to determine the amount of change within the effected components.

Subject:	Northern v. ONEOK/Bushton Measurement Issue/Chromatograph malfunction 9/19-10/11


	Ken Cessac reported to me today concerning a problem with Northern's chromatograph at the Bushton Plant that occurred on 9/19 after a routine annual replacement of calibration gas by ETS, and that was fixed yesterday, although Ken needs to review the fix.  In a nutshell, the problem appears likely to have caused the volumes to be off for the period of time at issue; it is yet to be determined whether the Btu's per MMBtu will be off.  Angela Mendez apparently caught this when certain values started repeating themselves.  I am told that a similar problem was experienced when the chromatograph was first installed years ago, but thought to have been fixed.  
	
	Once Ken has finished his review and I have spoken with Rick Kile, we can draft the appropriate letter.  

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

      Rick,

      Thanks.  I understand that the ESD is an annual simulated emergency d=
epressurization of the ETS compressor station on the lean and rich lines up=
stream of the Bushton Plant.  By operating the ESD valve, all the gas pipin=
g in the plant yard can be blown to atmosphere by Northern.  If that is don=
e, the Bushton Plant obviously goes down and loses the ability to service i=
ts customers for a period of time. =20

      You advised that in ESD simulations conducted in years past, we did n=
ot require the compressor to be fully blow down; we performed it in such a =
way that no depressurization at all was required, so the Bushton Plant was =
not out of service at all during the ESD simulations.  This year, however, =
someone in Northern's compliance section (maybe Pat Long's group) has requi=
red that the ESD simulation be conducted in such a way that partial depress=
urization of the yard piping will be necessary.  Northern has figured out a=
 way to do this such that the flow of gas to the Bushton Plant will be unin=
terrupted, with some small pressure changes.

     The ESD would normally last 15-30 minutes; however, Northern would als=
o like to take the opportunity to perform needed work on the Northern gener=
ators located
at the ETS compressor station as well.  This will extend the simulation per=
iod to about two hours.  During this time, Northern's measurement equipment=
 (the meters, the chromatograph, and the two Fisher Rocs) will be on batter=
y backup.  You mentioned that the big power hog would be the gas chromatogr=
aph.=09

    My gut is that we don't want to take any unnecessary chance that our ba=
ck-up batteries would fail and leave us in a position where we had to rely =
on Plant PTR. Accordingly, my suggestions is that we should immediately inv=
estigate renting a Honda generator or some other back-up power source, and =
call Jim Bowen of Instromet for his input.  Please remember that although J=
im was our expert in the arbitration, you don't want to just forward our in=
ternal memos and correspondence to him without checking with me first.

     I await the input of others.

    (Parenthetically, for the time being, I am asking that everyone put "No=
rthern v. ONEOK" in the Subject line of internal e-mails regarding gas meas=
urement at the Bushton Plant, given that we still have a lawsuit pending.  =
This applies whether or not the e-mail includes someone in Legal.)=09

Yesterday I visited with Mike Peschka and Casey Winter at the Bushton compr=
essor station, they mentioned a possible problem next week.  On October 11 =
the Bushton Plant will have a planned ESD.  A normal ESD would blow all pip=
ing down in the plant  yard, so no gas would flow to the Oneok processing p=
lant for a period of time.  This year certain blowdown valves will be block=
ed so gas will continue to flow to the Oneok processing plant, this will al=
low the Oneok plant to stay on.  Oneok requested that we maintain gas flows=
 to their plant, since they have no planned turn around this year.  The Bus=
hton measurement equipment will need to be functioning the entire time of t=
he ESD (this includes the chromatograph, Fisher Rocs, and the ultrasonic me=
ters), since gas will be flowing to the Oneok plant and back to us.  While =
the ETS compressor station is down, during the ESD, there will be work comp=
leted on the electrical equipment.  This work could take up to 5 hours, but=
 Casey hopes to complete the work in approximately 2 hours.  The back-up ba=
tteries will maintain power, to the measurement equipment, approximately 2 =
hours.  The potential problem is that if the work takes more than 2 hours t=
he batteries may fail, and we could lose measurement for a period of time. =
 Considering the Oneok measurement situation, we thought it might make sens=
e to notify you of this potential problem.  Thanks, please call if you have=
 questions.
