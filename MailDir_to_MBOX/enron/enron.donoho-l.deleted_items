Subject: CERA's Crude Oil Price Outlook - CERA Decision Brief 



Title: Crude Oil Price Outlook after September 11 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2743;


***********************************************************************

CERA's CRUDE OIL PRICE OUTLOOK

In this uncertain environment, CERA has made assumptions about how events will 
unfold in order to form a price outlook, and then has assessed the risks. 

* CERA's revised oil demand forecast is for a gain of just 0.3 million 
barrels per day (mbd) in 2002. The trend during 2002 is for a sharp year-on-
year drop in demand in the first quarter of 0.7 mbd,, followed by a 1.3 mbd 
increase in the fourth quarter as economic recovery sets in. 

* Contrasting against this message of very weak oil demand growth is CERA's 
outlook for a 1.0 mbd year-on-year gain in non-OPEC supply in 2002. 

* As a result, the potential exists for a dramatic oversupply of oil next 
year unless OPEC restrains its production. CERA's view is that OPEC continues 
to restrain production in late 2001 and 2002 in an attempt to shore up prices.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

For December we should have scheduled 363289 to ECS.

We Scheduled 250000.

Therefore, as of the end of December, we still need to schedule an additional 113289.

So far 15000 was scheduled for 1/2/02 and 11000 will be scheduled for the 3rd.

I did not receive any official numbers this month as to how much we owed ENA for January, so that still needs to be figured out.

I hope this is what you need,
Amy

Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
"We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s," said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. "Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather." 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
"This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather," said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

Amy's calculations should be close depending on:

1. verification of the volume TW owes ECS for January, and

2. Did ECS actually sell 25,000/day during those last 10 days of December? Randy seems to be saying that they sold 25,000/day for 5 days.

For December we should have scheduled 363289 to ECS.

We Scheduled 250000.

Therefore, as of the end of December, we still need to schedule an additional 113289.

So far 15000 was scheduled for 1/2/02 and 11000 will be scheduled for the 3rd.

I did not receive any official numbers this month as to how much we owed ENA for January, so that still needs to be figured out.

I hope this is what you need,
Amy

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, "What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Bill Rapp requested copies of contracts that deviated from our GISB boiler plate contracts.  He was to review them and determine whether he needed to include them in a project he was working on.  Josh delivered copies of the ones Craig identified below to him on Friday afternoon so I do not think you need to do anything.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Linda,

I am going through your list & should be able to send you the updates by the COB Tuesday or Wednesday. Most of these are accounting related reports that will be addressed with the rates and revenue project. 
Thanks Ramona

Could each of you review the attached spreadsheet of TW CBS reports and let me know by Friday 1/11/02 which of the reports are being used and which are not.  Several of the reports have not been run for years.

Thanks

Linda

Linda,

Could you please have someone review the attached spreadsheet of TW CBS Reports and Jobs and verify from the business perspective whether the reports/jobs still need to be functional in the CBS system once we transition to the CMS system?  Do the best you can.  Indicate for each item whether it is needed or obsolete.  David generated the list from current CBS information as of 11/12/2001.  It is my fault this did not get reviewed earlier.  This will help him as he designed the backfeed that will keep the accounting portions of CBS going.  If you are not sure of the need for certain reports, leave them blank and indicate to the right who might know this information in the business area.

Thanks!

ab.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Executive News:

PNM terminates merger with Western Resources

Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources announced Tuesday its board had
officially killed the proposed deal to buy Western Resources' electric
utility subsidiaries. The deal, originally valued at over $4 billion, had
been in trouble for months, and each side sued the other in state court in
New York. PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec. 31 under the
terms of the deal, if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards
completing the transaction. But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to
back out of the deal. PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the
deal alleging breach of contract, in part because of adverse rulings from
the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) on rates and a Western restructuring
plan considered vital to the transaction.

Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later, seeking at least $650
million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion, breach of contract,
sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings. Neither case has
been decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western's
case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNM's initial suit.
Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a planned restructuring in
preparation for the PNM transaction to a Kansas district court. Western

Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the 
Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB

Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001

Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices

Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your
pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power
producers-may have been lulled to sleep.

Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major
players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. 

While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major
producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market
because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a
hold on their fuel costs. 

However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his
hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract
coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. 

And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for
low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are
raring to get what they believe they deserve. 

One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the
country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy
usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal
stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift Toward Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2748;


***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Attached are the spreadsheets which show the amount of gas which should be nominated as payment for electricity provided to the Gallup Compressor.  The amount nominated for Bisti is a constant 8106 mmbtu/day each month.  Therefore the total daily amount for 
December was 11692 mmbtu/day and the total for January was 11668.

  

Thanks,

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

Today is the final day to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award.  Today is your last opportunity to nominate that special coworker who represents Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.  

Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past may be nominated again this year.  Also, there is no limit to the number of nominations you submit. 

Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by the end of the business day today. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com.  In Houston, forms are available in the elevator lobbies as well. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your prompt attention and participation.

Stan

Market - CERA Alert 



Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

As you may be aware, SAP system response time has been slow during the last three business days. SAP financials, iBuyit, and iPayit applications are experiencing longer than normal response times on most transactions. We recognize that system response is below expectations, and it has affected the Financial Close and other critical business processes. 

We are taking action to correct the problem. At this point we have identified a number of potential causes and have prepared a comprehensive plan to return the system to expected performance levels. 

Based on a preliminary review we have found a large number of poor performing jobs, programs and reports that were major contributors to the response problem. We are exploring ways to improve the response of these programs. In addition, we have tuned system parameters and database indexes, and we expect to see some improvement in overall system response starting today.

The heavy workload the last few days did cause a bottleneck on the database server. We are working with Enron Net Works to accelerate the acquisition of higher-speed processors for the SAP database server.  We have started development of an archiving project and database reorganization and tuning program, which will help improve database performance in the long term.

Our operations group will take a more active role in managing the peak system workload. This will involve identification of critical jobs, improved system monitoring and the development of a more balanced system workload schedule. 

We are working on a more comprehensive communication plan to keep users and executive management aware of system performance and Financial Close scheduling. 

We understand how important system performance is to Enron's business and we will keep you informed every step of the way until this situation is resolved.

The floor meeting with Stan Horton on this afternoon is expected to end at 2:30p.  We expect that it will not interfere with Steve Harris' scheduled Staff Meeting.  Should it go over, we would like to convene immediately following or at 3:00p.

All reports should be abbreviated to accommodate the shorten scheduled.

Thanks in advance,

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps 
Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. 
In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would "no longer make available to the public" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. 
Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to "respond timely to legitimate requests" for such documents. 
The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Given the anthrax scares on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, a spokeswoman said the Commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages.

=> NEWS AND NOTES

THE NEW WORLD OF COMMUNICATIONS

The world really did change on September 11.  Think of 
it:  Try to remember something you did during the first 
week of September -- a party, a movie, a dinner out.  
Doesn't that seem like a lifetime ago?

At a recent seminar I gave to a group of young members of 
the International Association of Business Communicators, 
I was asked, "How has communications changed since 
September 11?"  I think that there are two important 
shifts:  

1) All communications now must be relevant.  The era of 
cranking out meaningless press releases on top of fluffy 
brochures followed by disjointed ads is past.  I have 
been as guilty as the next person.  But here on out, 
irrelevant blather is not going to be tolerated by target 
audiences.  The example I use is the ubiquitous "new 
senior vice president" press release.  In the past, 
journalists (and the public) could dismiss these without 
a second thought.  Today, the recipient is just as likely 
to wonder, "Why is this company bothering to waste 
precious resources on this?"  (If the press release 
describes a newsworthy shift in the marketplace, and 
articulates how this new senior VP address that shift in 
a way that benefits the company's customers, then that is 
a step in the right direction.) 

2) Communications that are sensitive to "balance" are 
more likely to resonate.  Even if a communication is 
relevant, if it has an underlying message that some 
gadget or feature is incredibly important, it will fall 
on deaf ears.  What's important today?  Balance in life.  
Family.  Friends.  Even dogs <grin>!  For example, if you 
can demonstrate that your product or service can give 
your customer more time to spend on precious moments with 
their family, you are better off than if you highlight 
the 24x7 availability that allows people to work all the 
time...

EVALUATING CONSULTANTS

Brookwoods Group is a member of the Technology 
Entrepreneurs Exchange (www.texchange.org), and I 
attended the meeting last week as a panel of experts 
discussed the critical success factors for building a 
successful business. 

Bill Nash, president of Holland & Davis management 
consultants (www.hdinc.com) was one of the panelists, and 
I scribbled some notes from his talk, including a 
paraphrase of his four tough questions that should be 
asked of any consulting firm you are considering:

1)  Have you ever been fired by a client,
    and if so, why?

2)  Have you ever turned down a client
    opportunity, and if so, why?

3)  For your client's sake, have you ever
    removed yourself from a project, and
    if so, why?

4)  For your own sake, have you ever 
    fired a client, and if so, why?

=> INTERESTING INTERNET

This month marks the 75th anniversary of Winnie-the-Pooh.  
I think it may have been George Carlin who asked, "What 
is a Pooh?"  For those of us with a taste for unusual 
trivia, the name Winnie-the-Pooh was given by a real boy, 
Christopher Robin, to his stuffed teddy bear that had 
been previously called Edward Bear.  Five-year-old 
Christopher didn't really like the name, so his father, 
A.J. Milne, encouraged him to make up a new name.  The 
boy immediately came up with "Winnie-the-Pooh," a 
combination of the name of a friendly bear he had met at 
the London Zoo named Winnie (after the city of Winnipeg) 
and the name of a familiar swan at Kensington Gardens.  
See the entire story at:

www.pooh-corner.com/pooh.html

The original Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Kanga and Eeyore are 
now in a glass cabinet in the Donnell Center of the New 
York Public Library.  (Roo was lost in an apple orchard 
in the 1930s.)  See: 

www.nypl.org/branch/kids/pooh/winnie.html

Speaking of children, someone sent me a little Dr-Seuss-
like tale written to help explain the September 11 
attacks to children.  It resonated in my own child-like 
mind as well and is reproduced on our website at:

www.brookwoods.com/binch.htm
 
Speaking of Dr. Seuss, many people don't realize that Dr. 
Seuss for two years (1941-1943) was the chief editorial 
cartoonist for the New York newspaper "PM," and for that 
journal he drew over 400 editorial cartoons. See these 
serious political cartoons drawn in the familiar style 
during the early years of World War II at:

=> SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION

We are pleased to report continuous positive feedback 
from clients on all fronts. We posted some of the best 
comments on our Client page on the Brookwoods Group 
website at:

www.brookwoods.com/clients.htm

I will be a panelist for the "Effective HighTech 
Marketing/PR Best Practices Panel" at the November 10 
TiE-Houston Conference, "Rediscovering & Accelerating the 
Entrepreneurial Spirit."  See www.tie-houston.org for 
details.

Since my last Grapevine, we have brought on several great 
marketing and communications professionals, including 
consultant Nancy Burch and VP of Operations Lorry Harju.  
Lorry is working hard to refine our operations model and 
demonstrate added value to new and existing clients.

We ran a couple new print ads this summer, all of which 
use dogs to illustrate the predicaments of clients who 
could use help from Brookwoods Group.  One ad shows a dog 
balancing teacups on his nose 
(www.brookwoods.com/ad4.htm) and the other shows a dog 
trying to make-do with an ill-fitting solution 
(www.brookwoods.com/ad5.htm).  Frankly, some people think 
the latter ad is a little spooky.  Check it out and judge 
for yourself!

=> FRACTURED FEEDBACK

Comments from our readers...

Many readers noted that the HTML formatting did not 
really work on their mail readers.  Others received the 
formatting, but the graphics were not embedded where they 
belonged.  All in all, I think I'll stick with plain text 
for now!  If I want to show graphics, I'll use an html 
link!

Several people took us up on our offer to run a CarFax 
report for them.  

Gail Schutz commented on my bemoaning that my old car was 
always in the shop, noting, "I have also heard it said 
that the two best days in a boat owner's life are the 
first day and the last day."  She may be right.  My car 
has been in the shop since May (yes... May!).  

Kim Padgett noted that we use a woman on the phone in the 
bathtub as the icon for our Grapevine and "Buzz" sections 
of the website.  (www.brookwoods.com/buzz.htm).  She 
offered to "try to find one with a man taking a bath on a 
cell phone for the next issue!!"  I never got a picture 
from her, but I did find a picture of a naked man talking 
on a headset.  Does that count?  See 
www.brookwoods.com/other/890829-001.jpg

Hank Moore thinks we do a very good job and produce "one 
of the best e-newsletters that I've seen."  Thanks, Hank!

Tom Lammers, Denise Boyd, and several others wrote that 
the test to know whether you are ready to be a parent 
left them laughing out loud.  If you missed it, see

=> GRATUITOUS HUMOROUS

With all my problems over my old car in the shop, this 
seems like a good story to tell:

A mechanic was removing a cylinder head from the motor of 
a Bentley, when he spotted a world - famous heart surgeon 
in his shop. The heart surgeon was waiting for the 
service manager to come take a look at his car. The 
mechanic yelled across he garage, "Hey, Doc, can I ask 
you a question?"  
 
The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to the 
mechanic working on the Bentley. The mechanic 
straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, "So 
Doc, look at this engine, I also can open hearts, take 
valves out, fix 'em, put in new parts and when I finish,  
this will work just like a new one. So how come I get a 
pittance and you get the really big money, when you and I 
are doing basically the same work?" 
 
The surgeon paused, smiled and leaned over, and whispered 
to the mechanic...   
 
"Try doing it with the motor running."

----

This story illustrates the importance of providing clear 
instructions, not subject to interpretation:

A couple of Kentucky hunters are out in the woods when 
one of them falls to the ground. He doesn't seem to be 
breathing, his eyes are rolled back in his head.  
 
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. He 
gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead! What can I 
do?"  
 
The operator, in a calm soothing voice says, "Just take 
it easy. I can help. First, lets make sure he's dead."  
 
...There is a silence, then a shot is heard.  
 
The guy's voice comes back on the line. He says, "OK, now 
what?"

Lippman Consulting, Inc. has just completed the 3 rd quarter of 2001 San Juan 
Basin production report. This report contains historical gas volumes that are 
separated out by conventional and coal seam properties. The report also 
separates the production by each contributing state.  Volumes are reported 
annually as well as quarterly for the past 10 years.  The report contains 
charts and graphs depicting various historical statistics including the gas 
production volumes, number of new wells drilled each year and monthly rig 
activity. The data clearly shows that the San Juan Basin  production has 
peaked and is now on a decline.     

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one-time basis for $450.  If you would like 
additional information on this report or on any of our other reports, please 
feel free to contact me by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 
915-581-1668.

The purpose of this memo is to inform you of organizational changes for ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

What is the status of the consolidation?

Menu Changes:
Due to the increasing number of web applications, the applications menu will be changed from a drop-down selection list to a web page listing the available applications.  This change will be in effect after 5 pm 10/12/01.

Web Server Status:
http://home.ets.enron.com will be shutdown after 5 pm on 11/2/01
http://home.ops.ets.enron.com will be shutdown after 5 pm on 11/2/01

Migrated Applications:
Daily Market Summary http://gthou-ww04p/dms/

Sites in Progress:
OCC http://home.ops.ets.enron.com/occ/
System Optimization http://home.ops.ets.enron.com/optimization

Applications in Progress - 
OCC Phonebook 


How will this consolidation affect me as a user? As we roll out new sites, any bookmarks to the old sites will need to 
be modified.  If you navigate to an old site, you will see a redirect message requesting that you update your bookmarks and a link to the new site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team has contacted Webmasters with content or applications on the following ETS websites: http://home.ets.enron.com and http://home.ops.ets.enron.com to discuss the migration.    If you have content or applications on this server and have not been contacted, please call LaDonna Dervin as soon as possible.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Inadvertently, the wrong rate was submitted with the request for credit approval. The correct rate has been and continues at $0.04 /Dth. I apologize for any problems this mistake may have caused.
