Much Calif Power Price Gouging Beyond FERC's Reach -ISO

By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion." 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky 
calculations." 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February:

I spoke with Donna Bobbish this morning about Steve's question -- does the 
President have broader authority to take action during times of crisis.  
Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far.  
Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise, we asked 
Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether, 
and under what circumstances, the President's authority may be extended 
beyond the authorities discussed in the memo.  

We will let you know what we learn from that further research.

Sarah:  In response to Steve's inquiry, I did look into this question
briefly when you first gave me the assignment.  I read an interesting law
review article  on "The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States," for
a discussion of presidential powers.  There is no general emergency
authority granted the President in the U.S.  Constitution.  Also, the
article discussed the famous "Truman steel mills case," Youngstown Sheet &
Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), in which the Supreme Court declared
unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during the
Korean War.  In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike in
the national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the national
defense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce to
take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running.  The
Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such  an
action, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the
Constitution itself.  Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizure
authority, it invalidated the President's action.  The Supreme Court also
rejected the argument that the President had any powers that could be
implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution.

Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course of
action to look for specific authorities given to the President by statute
which might prove useful.

I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would be
entering "martial law-type" legal territory, where the President would be
acting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority (which
has been described a "zone of twilight"), and in light of the Truman steel
mills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.

Please let me know if you would like me to do anything more.  Thank you.
Donna

The Green Power Project is 16.5 mW. Enron Wind Corp. never shuts this plant
off; wind turbines are maintained individually. The plant has a 95%
availability, which means that only 5% of the turbines should be off line
for maintenance at any given time.

Dear Mr. Robinson:

Reference is made to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC)
letter dated May 1, 2001, directed to Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI),
relating to the above captioned subject.

The letter seeks outage information (the information) about generation
units in the State of California owned and/or operated by EPMI or any of
its affiliates.  As discussed in our recent telephone conversations,  Enron
Wind Corp., an affiliate of EPMI and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron
Corp., owns and operates various wind generation units in the state.  All
of these units, save for one, are QF's, and it is my understanding that you
are not be seeking the information on such units since their power is
subject to bilateral contracts with IOU's.  The remaining unit is the Green
Power Project in Palm Springs.  Enron Wind Corp. has a bilateral contract
with EPMI on the Green Power Project.

As regards the Green Power Project, the name of the contact person you
request is:

Mr. Tom Biernet
Vice President- Operations
Enron Wind Corp.
(661) 823-6750

A review of our files indicates that no outage reports or notices have been
sent to the CAISO or CPUC as of May 1, 2001, relating to the Green Power
Project.  Should any such notice or report be generated in the future, it
will be forwarded to your attention.

Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me at (202) 464-9170.

Rick, 

We are within 5% of SCE's negative CTC calculation up to January 17 (approx. 
$125 million).  However, as you can see from the attached chart, SCE would 
give us a $60 million-plus haircut with the methodology they are proposing 
for calculating negative CTC for post-Jan. 18.  Our protest to this 
methodology is due to be filed tomorrow, April 25.  I will call you to 
discuss the next step with SCE.

Attached is our record of credit balances for Enron DA accounts, as of
April 20.  The $84 million or so I referenced this morning is our
calculation of what SCE owed through 1/18.  If the PE credit methodology is
approved and applied back to January 19, then Enron would be rebilled for
$68 million (for transmission and distribution charges), which offset
against the earlier credit and the credit calculated for 1/19 - 4/20,
reduces the total credit owed to $62 million.

As we discussed, Jenny is more familiar than I with the details of the
credits and will call you back with someone from our Billing/Credit group
who is even more familiar.

I would also consider letting Jeff know the following:  1.  We have pending a 
complaint against SCE at the PUC to compel SCE to pay the negative CTCs to 
us.  ALJ and Commissioner for Complaint are same ALJ/Comm. proposing this 
treatment.  So no chance of different outcome there.  2.  SCE should drop its 
"affiliate market abuse" counterclaim that it filed in that proceeding.  3.  
Proposed order also implies that no cash payment--only bill credit--will be 
recognized for negative CTC.  [no suggesting mentioning this to Bryson].  4.  
Mike Day raised another alternative which would be that, for now, just get 
SCE to support "bifurcation" and deferral of negative CTC issue and then 
enter negotiations on payment afterwards.

Subject: Re: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE - CPUC Decision

First cut response to Jim's message - see below.  Please respond to me ASAP.

ISSUE:  Enron's PX credits with SCE of $---- million may be "stranded" if a 
PUC proposed decision is approved, as is expected to occur Thursday, June 28.

SCE stopped making PX credit payments January 5, 2001, supposedly because of 
its financial situation.  SCE asked the PUC for authority to reflect the 
accumulated credits on the customer's bill, and suspend any cash payments of 
such credits  The proposed decision grants this request.

SCE has also asked the PUC to formally clarify the manner in which PX credits 
are calculated.  Prior to January 19, 2001, the PX credit was based on the 
actual Power Exchange clearing prices.  On January 19, 2001, the Power 
Exchange effectively stopped operations.  SCE's proposal is to determine the 
PX credit post-January 19, 2001 as the weighted average of its own retained 
generation and QF contract costs.  The PUC has not yet said when it would 
rule on this issue.  Enron's position before the PUC is that the credit 
should continue to be based on a market measure, like NP 15 and SP 15 indices.

Enron's P X credits with SCE could become "stranded" if they are interpreted 
to accrue to the account of the individual customers receiving service and 
not Enron.   Once Enron's customers were re-sourced back to the utility, new 
account numbers were established for these accounts.  This creates a loophole 
which allows SCE and the PUC to interpret the accumulated credits as applying 
to specific customer accounts and not to services purchased by Enron. 

Core Issues for a settlement with SCE on PX credit issue:

Cash payment of owed PX credits through January 18, 2001.  (For Enron, this 
is $123 million.)

Agreement to use SCE-proposed method of PX credit calculation starting 
January 19, 2001.  (Enron drops market proposal.)

PX credits accrued starting January 19, 2001 can be paid in the form of bill 
credits to any account so designated by the Energy Service Provider for 
receipt of such credits.  (Enron credits are transferable to services 
rendered for other Enron customers.)
 
Other SCE debts (????) are not called in immediately.

Harry & Sue --

Please work with Mike Day on Monday am to develop the following -

1. Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's 
request for suspension of payment of PX Credit.
2. Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.

Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.  
Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC 
decide this issue.

I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on 
Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the 
Proposed Decision.

Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).

Thanks,

Jim

Jeff --

A few other things that may be helpful. 

1. Mwhrs Sold and Total Revenues by Month (would be nice to have hourly 
info).  The Judge threw out a point that maybe the right answer was just 20% 
to Total Revenues.  I think that this would be horrible.

2. Reliant is providing to all other Sellers a Hourly Power Price using the 
March 9 FERC order.  Question - Can we determine from Oct 2000 - May 2001 the 
implications from this re-stating of prices?  Similar to the analysis last 
night, just different prices.

Thanks,

Jim

I am a private citizen with no direct financial interest in the energy

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements

but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be 
gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial 
market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso 
suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for 
the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in 
California in balance.)

I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let 
me know if you want a copy faxed.

This is potentially important.  If FERC were to grant Puget's request to 
dismiss and withdraw its complaint, it could undercut the suggestion made to 
Ray A. by a FERC staffer at a recent meeting that FERC could potentially 
order WSCC refunds prior to the July 2, 2001 refund effective date 
established in the June 19 Order (which FERC could attempt to do by revising 
its previous dismissal of Puget's complaint on rehearing, which is pending.)

My guess is that FERC will not wish to give up the leverage that it has on 
this front, and thus will sit on Puget's motion to withdrawal for the time 
being while the settlement efforts are ongoing.

The ALJ issued his initial decision on the CPUC complaint case today.  As was widely expected, he found that El Paso and its merchant affiliate, El Paso Merchant, were guilty of affiliate abuse.  However, he did not find clear evidence that they were exercising market power.

The ID is attached.

Yesterday in a conversation with Mike Day, he confirmed we have no basis in 
AB 1890 or anything else to claim entitlement to continuation of some type of 
market based credits.  Given that interpretation, we tentatively decided the 
advice letter protest would be drafted to say at least these things -
1)  the PE credit should include the 4 cents of surcharge (the 1 from January 
plus the latest 3 now subject to rate design hearings)
2)  there is no restriction on the PE credit going negative.
3)  the tariff should be clarified to say it excludes DWR purchases, assuming 
that is the case.

If we are going to otherwise object to the Advice Letter, the approach could 
be:
1) the Commission needs to generically address the replacement of PX credits 
and not allow one utility to change it through an advice letter;
2) the Commission has not addressed the entitlement of DA customers to hydro 
assets and must make a determination on this;
3) if the Commission approves this Advice Letter, it should say SCE has no 
further claim to stranded costs on its generation;
4) as an interim measure until the Commission fully looks at PX credit 
calculations,  we recommend that SCE adopt a PX proxy, such as Dow Jones.

This approach allows us to argue process rather than entitlement to market 
based credits.  Given all the time constrains, I'd suggest we capture these 
latter issues through a very simple 1-2 paragraphs.

Bob, I know you're getting a call together; I'll call you to confirm.

As you can see from below, I don't see how we can support the PE Advice 
Letter.  We reserved our right to oppose it in the stip.  I think we should 
clarify that SCE will acknowledge our full claim ($124 million) without any 
offset in exchange for our cooperation with the MOU.

Attached is our record of credit balances for Enron DA accounts, as of
April 20.  The $84 million or so I referenced this morning is our
calculation of what SCE owed through 1/18.  If the PE credit methodology is
approved and applied back to January 19, then Enron would be rebilled for
$68 million (for transmission and distribution charges), which offset
against the earlier credit and the credit calculated for 1/19 - 4/20,
reduces the total credit owed to $62 million.

As we discussed, Jenny is more familiar than I with the details of the
credits and will call you back with someone from our Billing/Credit group
who is even more familiar.

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time=
=20
trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP")=
=20
for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for=20
replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had=20
dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's exces=
s=20
energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to=

help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is=
=20
the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO=

that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything=20

did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had=20

Subject:	Thoughts on PX Credit Claim with Edison

Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
>From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

Mark:  As I am sure you agree, I thought that CA Attorney General Lockyer's 
comment last week in the WSJ was one of the most outrageous I have ever seen 
from a major public official.  I wanted to send a brief "Letter to the 
Editor" of the WSJ to that effect.  However, in light of the sensitivity of 
the entire CA situation in general and the further press last week in the New 
York Times, I did not want to do that without confirming with you that doing 
so would not be objectionable to the Company.  A copy of the proposed letter 
is attached.  I would propose to submit this in my individual capacity, not 
as counsel to the Company.  I'll wait to hear from you, or from Mark, Vicki 
or Rick before doing anything.    Thanks.  John

Electricity traders' tech habits get scrutiny 
Posted at 10:23 p.m. PDT Sunday, June 10, 2001 
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


State officials investigating California's extraordinary energy prices are 
zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their profession 
-- from e-mail and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and 
online trading floors.

This technology may be key, they say, to helping traders acquire the intimate 
knowledge needed to manipulate California's troubled energy market. With 
minute-to-minute knowledge of market conditions, some traders went even 
further, two lawsuits charge, illegally coordinating bids and sending 
electricity prices to record-breaking levels.

The state Attorney General's Office has subpoenaed from power generators 
software used to formulate bidding strategies, names of employees providing 
computer support, communications with a prominent industry Web site and the 
name of firms that handle computer networks.

And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant 
to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the state's 
Internet-based spot market, among other things.

``Once you were knowledgeable about its operations, the opportunity to game 
it became pretty obvious,'' said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, who chairs 
the committee.


Anti-trust laws

Working together, or colluding, to fix prices is illegal and violates state 
and federal anti-trust laws. 

Sharing sensitive industry data, if it involved financial markets, would be 
considered insider trading and would be treated far differently, said Anjali 
Sheffrin, head of market analysis for the Independent System Operator, which 
manages the state's power grid. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission polices the nation's stock markets, 
but wholesale energy trading goes largely unwatched by federal regulators.

San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre agreed with Sheffrin. Aguirre is part of a 
team of lawyers who have filed two lawsuits against leading power generators 
such as Dynegy, Duke Energy and Williams Energy Services.

``It's basically an embryonic kind of trading market that involves the 
sharing of inside information, and the only reason they're getting away with 
it is there's no SEC cop,'' he said.

Energy companies dismiss these charges as speculation.

``All of these `What ifs?' '' said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. ``The fact 
of the matter is we've played by the rules, we've acted ethically, we haven't 
done anything wrong.''

Energy companies say the way they use technology is all above board.

``That's something that we're proud of, that we have all of the tools to do 
the best possible job in the trading,'' said Paula Hall-Collins, spokeswoman 
for Tulsa-based Williams Co.

Not everyone is persuaded that energy companies actually conspired to hike 
prices.

Some public officials and energy industry players call the technology focus a 
red herring. California's energy problems are far more fundamental, they say, 
than click-happy energy traders with spreadsheets. The now-defunct California 
Power Exchange, for example, was something of a sitting duck, unable to 
freely shop around for the best electricity prices.


Wealth of data

Other experts believe the sheer wealth of data floating around -- from river 
flows to 30-day forecasts of power line outages -- gives traders an unfair 
advantage. ``That's exactly the issue,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of 
the University of California Energy Institute. ``The issue is whether all 
this information is actually doing more harm to competition than benefit to 
the efficiency of procuring and selling power.''

The best illustration of this is a somewhat legendary Web site blunder.

In that incident, an energy industry association called the Western Systems 
Coordinating Council posted highly sensitive real-time data about 
transmission of extra-high voltage electricity in California. 

Alarmed that such information could be used to game the market, the state's 
grid operator last October demanded that the trade group take the information 
off the site, which it did.

A former energy trader who spoke to the Mercury News on the condition that he 
not be identified, said: ``When you can calculate exactly what a market needs 
and where its surplus is going to come from, then you have the ability to 
essentially fix prices. It's like a linear equation. You know exactly what 
the end equation is going to be.''

At issue are how traders employ the tools that, like the telephone and fax 
machine, are standard in trading electricity: software, data Web sites and 
Internet energy exchanges.

Dunn and other public officials acknowledge that it isn't clear how 
technology was used in suspected abuses. And no one has turned up slam-dunk 
evidence of collusion.

The ISO has done extensive studies that conclude traders drove up prices 
through gaming. The high prices have cost the state at least $6.7 billion 
since May 2000.

``Energy traders trade information among themselves,'' the ISO's Sheffrin 
charged, comparing it to insider-trading. ``These traders are calling each 
other up all the time.''

The former energy trader who talked to the Mercury News agreed energy traders 
as a very incestuous group. 

They talk and e-mail every day. ``Sometimes many, many, many times a day,'' 
he said. ``Some of them have instant messaging.'' He said he believes it 
could amount to ``de facto collusion.''

But proving collusion in court is extremely difficult.

The sticking point, said UC's Borenstein, is showing exactly what energy 
traders did with the information.

``These guys aren't actually sitting down in a room together,'' Borenstein 
said. ``They sort of watched each other and said, `Well, other firms are 
keeping capacity out and we will too.' ''

The former energy trader said he doubted that investigators would prove 
collusion because traders will cover their tracks. ``They're expunging 
hard-drive data as we speak,'' he said. ``The documents are long gone.''


Lawsuits

Two class-action lawsuits, filed on behalf of taxpayers by San Francisco and 
by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, accuse the energy companies of colluding to 
drive up prices. Neither lawsuit clearly documents how the energy companies 
engaged in secretive data-sharing.

The Bustamante suit, however, targets a new Internet site for wholesale 
energy trading launched last fall by heavy-hitter energy companies such as 
Duke and Reliant. The Atlanta-based Web site, IntercontinentalExchange, is 
one of at least a dozen such electronic trading floors that have popped up on 
the Internet in the last four years. None of these trading exchanges -- which 
analysts say are the wave of the future -- are regulated.

IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment since it is not a party to the 
suit.

The lawsuit charges the site ``has several features that support collusive 
behavior amongst market participants.'' 

One is that only approved traders have access to IntercontinentalExchange and 
those traders can pick who they want to trade with and shut other traders 
out. And more importantly, Aguirre said, the energy companies who own many of 
these Web exchanges get the tremendous benefit of having a record of all the 
trades.

``It gives them an enormous amount of market data that no one else has access 
to,'' he said. ``It's a conduit for collusion.''

As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement 
proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that 
it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 
forward.

Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the 
Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the 
Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a 
fallback approach.

Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to 
us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.

Thanks

Ray and Sarah

As most of you are aware, the FERC mediator yesterday submitted his 
recommendation to the agency, culminating a 15-day mediation process. Among 
the mediator's recommendations is that FERC convene an evidentiary hearing, 
to close within 60 days, to determine the offset or refund liability of 
suppliers of energy, including Enron, into the California's spot markets.  I 
expect FERC to act on the recommendation early next week and issue an order 
directing that a hearing be convened within possibly a week or less.  
Accordingly, getting organized is an imperative.

Several of us participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss whether 
Enron should retain Seabron Adamson of Frontier Economics to serve as Enron's 
expert in the hearing.  The decision was made to retain Seabron for this 
purpose.  Seabron has informed me that he can come to Washington to start 
preparing discovery and developing a theory for Enron's case.  The discovery 
that Enron pursues will obviously need to be coordinated with litigation 
counsel representing Enron in the various California civil litigations and 
investigations.

The mediator's recommendation largely ignores two of the issues that were set 
for mediation (moving CA power supply to the forward markets and restoring 
creditworthiness of CA purchasers) and instead deals exclusively with the 
third issue:  Did any supplier overcharge for post-October 1, 2000, 
short-term (24 hrs or less) sales into the PX and ISO and, if so, should the 
supplier refund the overcharge or have it offset against amounts owed the 
supplier?

The mediator did not find a specific overcharge amount. Instead, he opined 
that, while not the $8.9 billion claimed by the CA delegation, overcharges 
"do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion 
dollars in an aggregate sum."

Per the mediator's recommendation, the evidentiary hearing should address the 
details of a methodology for determining how much each supplier overcharged.  
The "single" methodology recommended by the mediator is a modified, 
retroactive application of the price ceiling that FERC ordered imposed 
prospectively on the entire west in a June 19 order.  That methodology 
classes as an overcharge any amount charged between October 2, 2000, and May 
28, 2001, that exceeded the operating cost of the least efficient gas-fired 
turbine dispatched in CA in an hour plus an adder for O&M, a credit premium 
and NOx.  The recommended methodology deviates from the prospective price 
ceiling in several respects, including that it would be applied in all hours, 
without discount, and would reflect actual heat rates and separate actual 
hourly natural gas prices for southern CA and northern CA, resulting in two 
separate proxy prices.

The mediator recommends that this methodology be applied to all suppliers, 
even those that did not supply power wholly from gas-fired turbines.   
Nevertheless, in a contradictory passage, the mediator goes on to recognize 
that his recommended methodology "may not be appropriate for all sellers," 
but that any sellers advocating a different methodology "should bear the 
burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the 
methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period.."  (emphasis 
added).

Assuming that the agency largely follows the recommendation of the mediator, 
then it appears Enron, working through Seabron, can pursue one or two basic 
theories.  First and most simply, Enron can accede to the mediator's 
methodology and work with the large generators (Duke, Reliant, Dynegy, 
Mirant) to force up the proxy price (and lower the overcharge amount) that 
the mediator's methodology produces.  Alternatively, in addition to trying to 
force up the proxy price, Enron can try to develop a theory that the 
mediator's methodology either should not apply to power marketers or should 
apply differently to them.  This second approach will likely be joined by 
other non-thermal generator suppliers, such as PowerEx.  The obvious risk in 
pursing this second approach is that Enron might become exposed to discovery 
into the cost basis of its book over the entire refund period..

Those of you who will need or want to discuss the issues with Seabron, please 
respond by letting me know as between Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next 
week, which works better for you for a meeting in Washington or a 
teleconference.

Need to also include the moneys owed to Enron and its affiliates related to the wholesale power transactions.  We should also seek to clarify the language about us supporting the PE Advice Letter proposal on going-forward.

FYI.  Bob Williams should be touching base with you; or it would be useful 
for you to touch base with him.  Edison appears to be staking out it's 
negotiating position with us through their filing.  

In short, they "recalculate" the PX credit post-Jan. 19 (when DWR took over 
procurement).  That recalculation turns our $125 MM dollar PX credit claim 
into $63MM.  So we're pretty far apart.  

We agreed at this point to oppose the filing and say:

1) through the end of the rate freeze, or end of 3.31.02, the status quo 
remains--"PX credit" based on market price (Dow Jones index).
2) however, if you want to go "utility purchase" price as the basis for the 
credit, then it must be the utility's full cost of power (retained 
gen+QFs+DWR+ISO real time).
3) negative credit during the transition can still occur.
3) Edison's proposal should be rejected.

Best,
Jeff

A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data
Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information 
crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price 
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy 
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation.

Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information 
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But 
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without 
Duke's consent.

The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have 
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in 
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the 
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout 
the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and 
efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential 
information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.

Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and 
which stay secret.

"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what 
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.

Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers

Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information 
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."

Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month 
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what 
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.

But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the 
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity 
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its 
explanation.

Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full 
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.

But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, 
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, 
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.

"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full 
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions 
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.

To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive 
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke 
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the 
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.

Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in 
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and 
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to 
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke 
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the 
committee plans to turn over.

"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we are 
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't 
know what we are ultimately going to do."

The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they 
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have 
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, 
were cited.

Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are 
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally 
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the 
final arbiter of such issues.

Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited 
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most 
recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.

On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.

On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.

Jim

Two questions:

    1.  How do we fight the notion that a FERC retroactive determination of "just and reasonable rates" should be re-injected into the calculation of negative CTCs?  It seems to me that there are at least equitable arguments against that.  Will this be a CPUC or FERC issue?

    2.  Can we use the utilities' underscheduling to push them back on this, legally or in negotiations?   Since they contributed to the market disfunction, shouldn't they have to live with the consequences?

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment

Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers    Sunday, May 
20, 2001 
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 


Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by 
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, 
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy 
industry workers. 

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also 
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns 
that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are 
supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 

The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was 
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four 
times as much as a year ago. 

Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters 
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to 
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 

Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant 
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the 
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of 
constricting supply. 

But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were 
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed 
to the plants' deteriorating condition. 

"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the 
ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, 
he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game 
something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units 
up." 

Unusual phone calls 

Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. 
say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early 
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's 
headquarters in Houston. 

According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations 
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, 
then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as 
many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and 
electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room 
computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call 
to ramp the units back up. 

"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who 
only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear 
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market 
change." 

The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a 
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in 
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one 
of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 

"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading 
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl 
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that 
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to 
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 

Corporate denial 

Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to 
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including 
AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have 
asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, 
decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 

While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as 
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the 
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 

"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California 
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an 
operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), 
they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within 
an hour." 

Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers 
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it 
first. 

The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but 
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used 
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the 
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid 
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one 
of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 

Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment 
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation 
into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source 
familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to 
have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business 
practices laws. 

Invisible practice 

How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 

One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually 
invisible to regulators and grid operators. 

When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain 
amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an 
average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot 
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total 
amount of energy required. 

The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their 
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. 
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity 
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, 
the output was back at the expected level. 

Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if 
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and 
remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the 
price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 

The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of 
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more 
aggressive than others. 

"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they 
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would 
go up. 

"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd 
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 
'Bring it down again.' " 

Rapid changes 

These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from 
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California 
Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of 
the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which 
also reduced wear and tear. 

"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the 
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on 
the units." 

ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on 
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather 
than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when 
companies were withholding power. 

But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in 
driving up energy prices. 

A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day 
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of 
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost 
among those companies. 

Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for 
more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their 
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity 
from all sources. 

Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state 
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It 
was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. 
(278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 

Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power 
for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 

Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 

accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an 
operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the 
result of legitimate equipment failures. 

Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of 
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five 
California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so 
the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 

But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at 
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously 
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was 
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit 
offline because of the problem. 

Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to 
keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for 
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary 
maintenance. 

Ramping may be rampant 

Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source 
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs 
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And 
an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy 
said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling 
calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in 
Minneapolis, he said. 

Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo 
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and 
denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 

In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's 
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the 
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 

One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple 
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that 
price was not met. 

On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be 
shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt 
hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 

"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

Randy, Becky and I just had a conference call with John Kroeger, attorney in 
FERC's  Market Oversight and Enforcement Office, about the data request we 
just received from them regarding gas deals into California for May 2001.  We 
explained that the data request we just received was in many regards 
identical to the one FERC staff sent us in December and which we answered in 
January and we directed him to that response, both for the explanation of how 
our business works and why we can therefore cannot answer the questions as 
they were framed, and also for an example of what the data will look like for 
the new time frame, if we submit it.  (We may have to file written consent 
for Kroeger to review this previously filed data, which we agreed to do).  
Mr. Kroeger stated they wanted the data request to be construed with common 
sense (a refreshing notion).  He agreed that the"contracts" they want would 
just be deal tickets for the applicable time frame.  He also indicated a 
willingness to extend the time so that we can file information when we get it 
in due course.  He will get back to us after he looks at the info already 
filed in the SDG&E complaint.

The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the 
Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, 
effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's 
recommendation.  I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which 
Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the 
following high points: 

1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally 
inappropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge 
should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.

2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order 
must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and 
after October 2.

3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the 
State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these markets.

4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the 
methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. 

The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was 
receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 
methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this 
should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form 
part of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive 
refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be 
subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund 
methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he 
felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the 
matter was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises 
were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this 
insight will shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to 
recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 
order with its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, 
although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.

Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge told 
us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that 
the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is likely 
that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast 
track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine "unresolved 
issues of material fact".  The scope of the hearing has not been determined, 
but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for 
marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.
