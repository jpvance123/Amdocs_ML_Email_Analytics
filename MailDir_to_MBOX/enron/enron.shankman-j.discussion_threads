Jeff,

The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was 
previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other 
engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.  

If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave 
Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys 
are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple 
of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley 
leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron 
Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of 
Izzo's guys).  

If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this 
is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.

Thanks
Eric

From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 19/10/2000 17:24 CDT
To: All Enron Worldwide
cc:  
Subject: Organizational Changes

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff

ARGENTINA:THE UNPALATABLE CHOICE AMONG DEFLATING, DEFAULTING OR DEVALUING

Executive Summary
The recession in Argentina is deepening and the government faces painful=20
choices in addressing it
While the current strategy of deflation is unpopular, default or devaluatio=
n=20
could be even more painful
Deflation will remain the strategy of choice so long as De la Rua survives;=
=20
if his government falls, both default
      and devaluation become likely
Mexico and Brazil are in a stronger position to face the fallout from a=20
devaluation than they were in 1998

November 16, 2000

1. Argentina Recession

The question haunting observers of Argentina is whether the De la R?a=20
administration will succeed
in stabilizing the country=01,s economy and pulling it out of its second=20
recession in five years. Indeed,
the 11-month old administration has not lived up to expectations and is=20
quickly losing market
confidence. Although the country has so far maintained the support of the I=
MF=20
and Washington,
the outcome of the unfolding crisis is by no means certain. Argentina is=20
trapped in a fixed
exchange regime that succeeded in taming inflation but is now impairing its=
=20
competitiveness and
long-term prospects.

2. Deflate, Default, or Devalue?

The administration faces a number of unenviable choices as it tries to redu=
ce=20
the difference
between internal and external prices. It can continue with its present cour=
se=20
of action, attempting
to cut its fiscal deficit amid a deepening recession and a growing debt=20
crisis. The adjustment of
relative prices would thus be accomplished through continued deflation. A=
=20
variant of this scenario
would be to renegotiate part of its external debt, in order to reduce the=
=20
increasingly onerous interest
payments, or default on its sovereign bonds. This, however, would destroy t=
he=20
last shred of
confidence, jeopardize Argentina=01,s future access to international capita=
l=20
markets, and ruin the
country=01,s relations with major industrialized countries. Finally, the co=
untry=20
could opt to devalue.
Arguably, the financial and social cost of this action would be high, but t=
he=20
country could recover
relatively quickly, as the cases of Mexico and Brazil suggest.

3. Recession Threatens De la Rua Survival

The outcome will depend on whether the De la R?a administration remains in=
=20
power. The
government is committed to pursuing a deflationary adjustment, hoping that =
it=20
will pay off by next
year, provided that the US dollar weakens and that its access to=20
international markets is
maintained. However, if the deflation is more prolonged and the economic=20
recession becomes
socially and politically untenable, the ruling coalition could disintegrate=
=20
and the president could be
forced to resign. In that case, the new government would probably decide to=
=20
devalue immediately
after taking power.

4. Brazil and Mexico Less Vulnerable to Contagion than in 1998

The Argentine crisis has raised the specter of emerging market financial=20
instability, notably in
Brazil and Mexico. However, these fears may be unfounded given the progress=
=20
made by the latter
countries in improving their fundamentals. Indeed, both Brazil and Mexico n=
ow=20
feature a floating
exchange rate regime and have gone a long way in terms of balancing their=
=20
fiscal accounts. Thus,
in the event of an escalation of Argentina=01,s difficulties, both countrie=
s are=20
well equipped to
overcome temporary financial turmoil.

The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks

What do you think of this:

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of 
the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross 
commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and 
promote aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321.

Hi Rick, 

I understand it is hot in Dubai--hopefully it will cool off soon.  On an 
organizational matter, I'm not too comfortable with your creating new org 
charts, and creating a new exec committee, etc.  Please call me next week so 
we can discuss this.  

Jeff

Bjarne was reviewed as a part of Enron Europe this time and his promotion was 
based on a long period of  high performance.   He is viewed as one of the 
most valuable people in the business and there was no controversy whatsoever 
in London about his promotion.   In fact I repeatedly get calls for his 
services from various groups around Europe who would love to hire him if they 
had the opportunity.  In Oslo he has been one of the main contributors behind 
most off our models, and I think that the job he has done with setting up the 
Weather desk here in Oslo deserves very positive feedback, even if we didn't 
make money last year.  We have really moved up the deal flow and are poised 
for an outstanding year 2001 in Weather.

In the future I will obviously cross check all things like this with you and 
Mark, so there aren't any misunderstandings going forward.  

Regards 

Thor

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.

Hi, hope you are doing great.  I was wondering if you've met Russell Dyke, 
who is in Lagrasta's group, and who I told could get into the LNG before you 
came over.  He has great international experience, and LNG experience.  He 
might be a great match with the Jose team, since I'm uncomfortable with their 
understanding of MTM, and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of 
doing business.  (Today, Russel (assoc/mgr at year end) closed a deal with 
CSFB worth 19 million to us.)  Overall a solid guy.   Let me know what you 
think.  (Merritt and Russell know each other well, and have worked on 
projects together)

Also, I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to 
trade dutch power, but was very interested in staying in touch with her, 
possibly to trade freight, etc.

I spoke with Tom Piazze at Wharton again this morning, about a reduction in 
the financial commit. from us.  He was not receptive, and in the past, I've 
suggested energy outsourcing for the University, and more recently discussing 
their broadband needs.  Others here have thought about this at Enron (like 
the California University system).  Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run 
with this in a more direct approach and see what happends.  (Tom P.  was open 
to all of this, of course).

FYI,  thanks.   Jeff

Subject: The stats


Ahead of tonight's stats, I've gone through last week's numbers (note - DOE, 
not API) and a few things leap out as worth noting and looking for this week.

Despite the API numbers, and the Mexican hurricane, crude imports were down 
just 150 kb/d, just 40 of which was in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast). Although imports 
are down from the peak in August, they still lie at least 500 kb/d above 
recent years' levels.
Bizarrely, the SPR rose by 0.5 mbbls last week, and 70kb/d of imports were 
specifically allocated to SPR - partly offsetting the 4.5 mbbl commercial 
stock draw.
There is no sign yet of distillate demand slowing, rather it continues to 
climb, and is well into winter levels.
Distillate output is strong, due to very high yields, rather than high 
throughput.

What does this mean for stocks?

The refinery runs show we are well into the maintenance season, and crude 
stocks almost always rise this time of year. But if the weather disruptions 
did not show up in last week's DOEs, they may appear tomorrow. DOE crude 
stocks are 2.5mbbls above API.
With distillate demand still storming, and runs falling, we could be in for 
another week or two of distillate draws.
As a result of the yield and the runs, gasoline stocks will likely follow the 
seasonal pattern and fall once more. DOE mogas stocks are 3.5 mbbls below API.

The consensus appears to be for builds across the board, but some of these 
factors might argue otherwise. Some charts are attached illustrating the 
points.

Mark, Thor, and Todd,

Thanks for the video conference this morning.  Mike and I are convinced 
weather can and will be an extremely profitable business.  One issue I would 
like to address is EnergyDesk.com.  It seems like an interesting idea, but 
I'd like to find out more about it, and in relation to the work Tom Gros in 
doing in NetWorks.  I'd also like to understand more about the scalability of 
this model, and our relationship with Kiodex.  

To that end, I do not want any proprietary data, product interface, and or 
other weather related matter and material to be part of EnergyDesk.com.  I 
will keep you updated as I learn more about these and other issues.  

Regards

Jeff

Wade, Bill & Neil,

Attached please find a summary compilation of the various issues and 
discussions that occured on the Dabhol project status update call that was 
presented to the LNG vessel interests.  I initially put this together as a 
way of organizing my notes, as well as communicating the latest status to 
Mark Haedicke and Alan Aronowitz in EWS/EGM Legal, who have asked to be kept 
advised of developments affecting the LNG contracts.  However, in discussions 
during this morning's Dabhol project lawyers' call, the issue was raised 
whether any written record of the discussions would be sent on to the 
shiplenders or the Greenfield sponsors.   I offered to make this summary 
available to the group if it would be of any assistance, my offer was 
promptly accepted, and that's why you see all the "cc" names in the address 
line above.
  
Of course, this summary is derived from my notes and somewhat contemporaneous 
recollections of the call, and as such I'm quite open to any suggested 
revisions to ensure the record is set as straight as possible.

Kind regards,
Dan

Will you be around this week?  I need to start thinking seriously about what 
to do next...though I still have to take that vacation you suggested.  

Some parts of this reorg baffle me...

Hope all is going well.

Jeff,
I'm the researcher who works with Ted Bland and has been surfacing 
Associate/Analyst type resumes for you and Lavorato (the binders we gave you 
guys).  Attached is the resume of a personal friend of mine, Robert Brown 
(Bobby), who may be a good fit for your group.  He is a '97 University of 
Pennsylvania graduate (3.1 GPA) with a degree in Economics and an 
International Finance concentration.  Additionally, he holds Series 7, 63, 65 
licenses.  

Bobby had expressed an interest in Enron to me some time ago, but didn't want 
to pursue anything at the time as he was going to be traveling for quite a 
while.  He contacted me last week, ready to explore opportunities at Enron.  
Upon reading his resume, I felt it is very much in line with many of the 
other resumes I'd surfaced for you and Lavorato to you last month (given to 
you by Ted Bland).  He's very bright, ambitious and I feel would fit very 
well into the Enron environment.

Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to call if you have any 
questions!
Amy

Jeff,

I spoke with your assistant earlier this week to get a date where you would 
be available to meet with El Paso regarding current LNG opportunities.  
Unfortunately, Eisbrenner (Senior VP El Paso Merchant Energy Services) was 
only available on Friday October 13th.    

Please come back to me if you can juggle your schedule to join us.  I have 
not invited any of the initial team for the time being.

Thanks
Eric

Subject: Re: tax structure pre-pays in the north sea  

In addition to this business below there is a very good chance that we are 
going to get a short of 1.4 mil bbls per year
of low sulfur fuel oil barges for 2001-2004.  We think this will be a good 
deal for us to get on the books since the bulk of the
hedging interest that the continental gas desk is bringing to us is customers 
looking to buy fuel to hedge natural gas prices. 
Continental gas are anxious to close this deal because the gas contract is 
well in the money and would like to book this
deal for this quarter.  There are var issues that need to be considered 
though so we need to address this at the beginning
of the week.

Thanks

Chris.

Subject: tax structure pre-pays in the north sea

corporate finance in London (primarily Chris Harris) has been looking for 
about 6 months into approaching the small north sea 
producers to do pre-pay purchase contracts that would enable the producers to 
significantly reduce their tax liability to the uk 
government.  These producers (talisman, kerr mcgee, lasmo, hess, enterprise, 
and a couple of others) are
currently paying some 65-70% of the value of crude oil back to the government 
and they feel the cost savings to the producers is 
something on the line of 25% after financing costs for the pre-pay.  I have 
asked them to do a presentation to you, as if you were one
of the producers, for how this structure would work.  Can you advise when you 
would be free for this?  The volumes could be large
(potentially upto 25 million bbls) and there is considerable basis risk in 
hedging these physical volumes.  we are looking into the
price that we could bid them for their physical oil that covers the basis 
risk.  It would be nice to try to combine this with some long-
term gas supply contract on the continent that would require us to be buying 
fuel and gasoil as the hedge and we are approaching
some of the large natural gas buyers in continental europe to see if the 
recent spike in oil prices has encouraged more hedging.
please let me know your thoughts on this and when/if you could be free for a 
presentation from chris harris.  

thanks,

chris.

the UK)  He's an aggressive, smart guy who I've known for 10 years.  Top 
notch.

Hope all is well

Jeff

PS  has Doug Rottenburg been calling anyone over there?  We haven't heard a

feel free to package the thing the way you think is best (perhaps a nice and 
impressive 3 or 4 lines paragraph on egm could be a good intro?)  and just 
copy me with what you have sent . give us your dates in london and let us

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

This is a matter of principle. Sheila was an analyst in our group this past 
summer. She clearly outperformed her peers. I  have attempted to have her 
brought onto the AA radar screensince last May .  Several of my atttempts to 
have her involved in the summer program were rebuffed. I think she should get 
an offer on principle, since we extend them to all high-performing summer 
analysts. Fred also agrees with me that she was a great asset. Dan Diamond 
and the rest of the EOL people would also concur.  I have no doubt she will 
sail through Super Saturday.

There are my thoughts on the matter.  I am happy to go along with your 
suggestions. However, for the record, I think the AA program has long way to 
go in its responsiveness and its ability to think outside the box.

Jeff,
Please see the notes below regarding Sheila Chang who was a summer intern 
brought in from the Rice Leadership Program.  Interns that came in through 
this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A 
Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of 
Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  
This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her 
skill level.  

With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and 
the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in 
your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila 
to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one 
of the EGM groups upon graduation.  Thanks so much and if you have any 
questions, please let me know.

Below is the information on Sheila as was described in my email this 
morning.  I understand she will have to go through the Super Saturday process 
just as any other Analyst would.  Will you please advise Jennifer on the 
process and when Sheila will be participating?  Thanks so much for assisting 
Jennifer in this effort.

Jennifer,

Shelly Jones is the Recruiting Manager for the Analyst Program and is 
managing the current Super Saturday process.  She can provide more

Thank you,

Shelly:
 Per our conversation this morning, I have attached Sheila Chang's resume. 
Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of 
the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this 
program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. 
I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to 
Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who 
can think outside the box.

Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was 
instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila 
left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas 
consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid 
grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the 
swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped 
develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila 
demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other 
attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe 
Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates 
in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in 
Global Markets upon her graduation.

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Dear Carrie,

first of all thanks for your patience and support ! 

Mark was "worldclass" ! After the meeting we collected feedback, where we
asked the participants for the presentations which exceeded the
expectations....and "Enron" was clearly number one !

So it was the subject itself, but also Mark as a speaker ! Your choice was
absolutely to the "point" !

Our company has agressive goals in terms of revenue growth...and all these
guys, who were in this room have somehow to do with it.
I think the Enron case just opened up a field of ideas and thinking to break
with our traditional business frame.

So it was exactly the right time.

Again, I can only say thank you for a great presentation and a great speaker
!

Please let Mark know, how well he did !

best regards

Rudi

Subject: Offshore crude

Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in 
the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling 
projects. This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure 
long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas 
trading desk activities. Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP 
program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than 
natural gas projects. 

They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which 
involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 
and #582. The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million 
barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd 
starting in 1Q 2003. Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 
API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur. Plans are to build a private pipeline to 
Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore. Peggy is 
finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.

Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude 
on either a fixed or floating basis. The floating could be tied to a Platt's 
index or the NYMEX. It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a 
physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last 
look from Murphy when the time is right. Another alternative is to give 
Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for 
the new production barrels. 

Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis 
differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003?

All-

Pursuant to our meeting yesterday, regarding the captioned matter, I have 
prepared a brief summary of the general issues, which are likely to be of 
interest to EOL and may be discussed in the meeting today with Andy Zipper.

Please feel free to add any points that you deem appropriate.

1.  The Links:

A link from Envera's site to EOL will be created.  The link would only be to 
the home page of EOL.   There would be no effect upon normal EOL vetting 
procedures for counterparties.

A link from Envera's site to Deal Bench will be created.  Again the link 
would only be to the home page of Deal Bench.  The Envera member companies 
would be required to follow normal Deal Bench registration of participants, 
however, such parties during 1Q 2000, would be permitted to engage in two 
free transactions on Deal Bench, with a maximum of 25 such free transactions 
in total. Presently, it is still under consideration as to whether such 
access would be to the auction area, or the collaboration area, or some 
variation thereof.  The fees to be charged post 1Q 2000 are under 
consideration.

2.  Trades

On a case-by-case basis, with no preexisting commitment, EGM would consider 
requests from Envera customers to make trades on a contingent basis on EOL.  
In the event that such trade is considered promising, then such pricing would 
be posted on EOL.  This would be free for the first 12 months, but thereafter 
such service would be provided for a fee.

3.  Envera Membership and Enron Services as Consideration for Envera Equity

EGM would pay between $300-500k for the ability to utilize the Envera hub to 
do deals for the period of [one year].

Some portion of the fee may also be considered as payment for equity in 
Envera LLC.  The Enron services provided (points 1. and 2. above, as well as 
access to Enron risk management and utility outsourcing ) will also be 
considered as payment for some portion of the Envera LLC equity.  The total 
equity received, is anticipated to be around five percent and the 
capitalization of the company is believed to be around $50,000,000.  The 
breakdown for the consideration for the equity still needs to be reviewed 
from the accounting side.

4.  Board Seat Considerations

Discussion regarding Enron obtaining an Envera Board seat has been 
discussed.  The fiduciary risks need to be considered, as we may be 
restricted in competing with Envera, unless certain steps are taken.  For 
example, if Commodity Logic were to be considered a competitor to Envera, 
unless we had the specific right to compete we could be subject to suit by 
Envera.  These risks may be negated through negotiation.  

The upside here would be the ability to have access to executives of certain 
petrochemical companies who are also shareholders in Envera and have Board 
seats.  It is believed that this type of access would likely lead to more 
deals for EGM and potentially for other Enron entities.

Unrelated to the Board seat, other promotional activities relating to Enron's 
services are foreseen through activities at Trade Shows and other networking 
venues.

5.  Building Connectivity Between Envera and Enron

It will be necessary to consider what activities, from the technical side, 
would be undertaken by Envera and what activities would be undertaken by 
Enron, to achieve the stated objectives, i.e. linking.

6.  Press Release

Envera is likely to want to make a public statement regarding this 
transaction with Enron.  The restrictions on the scope of such announcement 
must be considered.

I hope this is helpful.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

Subject: Analysis of Supreme Court decision


A friend sent me the following Q&A - it sums up the legal issues very
clearly.

--------------

Q: I'm not a lawyer and I don't understand the recent Supreme Court decision
in Bush v. Gore. Can you explain it to me?

A: Sure. I'm a lawyer. I read it. It says Bush wins, even if Gore got the
most votes.

Q: But wait a second. The US Supreme Court has to give a reason, right?

A: Right.

Q: So Bush wins because hand-counts are illegal?

A: Oh no. Six of the justices (two-thirds majority) believed the hand-counts
were legal and should be done.

Q: Oh. So the justices did not believe that the hand-counts would find any
legal ballots?

A. Nope. The five conservative justices clearly held (and all nine justices
agreed) "that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate
number of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by the
voter." So there are legal votes that should be counted but can't be.

Q: Oh. Does this have something to do with states' rights? Don't
conservatives love that?

A: Generally yes. These five justices have held that the federal government
has no business telling a sovereign state university it can't steal trade
secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law. Nor does the
federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns
in schools. Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause
to force states to take measures to stop violence against women.

Q: Is there an exception in this case?

A: Yes, the Gore exception. States have no rights to have their own state
elections when it can result in Gore being elected President. This decision
is limited to only this situation.

Q: C'mon. The Supremes didn't really say that. You're exaggerating.

A: Nope. They held "Our consideration is limited to the present
circumstances, or the problem of equal protection in election processes
generally presents many complexities."

Q: What complexities?

A: They don't say.

Q: I'll bet I know the reason. I heard Jim Baker say this. The votes can't
be counted because the Florida Supreme Court "changed the rules of the
election after it was held." Right?

A. Dead wrong. The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme
Court did not change the rules of the election. But the US Supreme Court
found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong.

Q: Huh?

A: The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote
is "clear intent of the voter." The Florida Court was condemned for not
adopting a clearer standard.

Q: I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislature's
law after the election.

A: Right.

Q: So what's the problem?

A: They should have. The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court
should have "adopt[ed] adequate statewide standards for determining what is
a legal vote"

Q: I thought only the Legislature could "adopt" new law.

A: Right.

Q: So if the Court had adopted new standards, I thought it would have been
overturned.

A: Right. You're catching on.

Q: If the Court had adopted new standards, it would have been overturned for
changing the rules. And if it didn't, it's overturned for not changing the
rules. That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did, legal
votes could never be counted.

A: Right. Next question.

Q: Wait, wait. I thought the problem was "equal protection," that some
counties counted votes differently from others. Isn't that a problem?

A: It sure is. Across the nation, we vote in a hodgepodge of systems. Some,
like the optical-scanners in largely Republican-leaning counties record
99.7% of the votes. Some, like the punchcard systems in largely
Democratic-leaning counties record only 97% of the votes. So approximately
3% of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can.

Q: Aha! That's a severe equal-protection problem!!!

A: No it's not. The Supreme Court wasn't worried about the 3% of Democratic
ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida. That "complexity" was not a
problem.

Q: Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more
than 20,000 Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan.

A: Nope. The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his
highest, best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with
Holocaust survivors, who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler.

Q: Yikes. So what was the serious equal protection problem?

A: The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the 3% of Democrats
(largely African-American) disenfranchised. The problem is that somewhat
less than .005% of the ballots may have been determined under slightly
different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their
best to accomplish the legislative mandate of "clear intent of the voter"
may have a slightly opinion about the voter's intent.

Q: Hmmm. OK, so if those votes are thrown out, you can still count the votes
where everyone agrees the voter's intent is clear?

A: Nope.

Q: Why not?

A: No time.

Q: No time to count legal votes where everyone, even Republicans, agree the
intent is clear? Why not?

A: Because December 12 was yesterday.

Q: Is December 12 a deadline for counting votes?

A: No. January 6 is the deadline. In 1960, Hawaii's votes weren't counted
until January 4.

Q: So why is December 12 important?

A: December 12 is a deadline by which Congress can't challenge the results.

Q: What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court?

A: Nothing.

Q: But I thought ---

A: The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its
work by December 12 to make things easier for Congress. The United States
Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the
Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding.

Q: But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes
counted by December 12.

A: They would have made it, but the five conservative justices stopped the
recount last Saturday.

Q: Why?

A: Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal.

Q: So why not separate the votes into piles, indentations for Gore, hanging
chads for Bush, votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the
other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won?
Then, if some ballots (say, indentations) have to be thrown out, the
American people will know right away who won Florida.

A. Great idea! The US Supreme Court rejected it. They held that such counts
would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gore's winning
would cause "public acceptance" and that would "cast[] a cloud" over Bush's
"legitimacy" that would harm "democratic stability."

Q: In other words, if America knows the truth that Gore won, they won't
accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gore's victory?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that a legal reason to stop recounts? or a political one?

A: Let's just say in all of American history and all of American law, this
reason has no basis in law. But that doesn't stop the five conservatives
from creating new law out of thin air.

Q: Aren't these conservative justices against judicial activism?

A: Yes, when liberal judges are perceived to have done it.

Q: Well, if the December 12 deadline is not binding, why not count the
votes?

A: The US Supreme Court, after admitting the December 12 deadline is not
binding, set December 12 as a binding deadline at 10 p.m. on December 12.

Q: Didn't the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for
arbitrarily setting a deadline?

A: Yes.

Q: But, but --

A: Not to worry. The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets
for other courts.

Q: So who caused Florida to miss the December 12 deadline?

A: The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount, the
rent-a-mob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating
officials, and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount

Q: So who is punished for this behavior?

A: Gore, of course.

Q: Tell me this: Florida's laws are unconstitutional?

A: Yes

Q: And the laws of 50 states that allow votes to be cast or counted
differently are unconstitutional?

A: Yes. And 33 states have the "clear intent of the voter" standard that the
US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida

Q: Then why aren't the results of 33 states thrown out?

A: Um. Because---um---..the Supreme Court doesn't say---

Q: But if Florida's certification includes counts expressly declared by the
US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we don't know who really won the
election there, right?

A: Right. Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won
Florida by about 20,000 votes (excluding the butterfly ballot errors)

Q: So, what do we do, have a re-vote? throw out the entire state? count
under a single uniform standard?

A: No. We just don't count the votes that favor Gore.

Q: That's completely bizarre! That sounds like rank political favoritism!
Did the justices have any financial interest in the case?

A: Scalia's two sons are both lawyers working for Bush. Thomas's wife is
collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush
administration.

Q: Why didn't they recuse themselves?

A: If either had recused himself, the vote would be 4-4, and the Florida
Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed.

Q: I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way.

A: Read the opinions for yourself:
http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.pdf (December 9
stay stopping the recount)
http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/00pdf/00-949.pdf (December 12
opinion)

Q: So what are the consequences of this?

A: The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our
Constitution (Al Gore) will lose to America's second choice who won the all
important 5-4 Supreme Court vote.

Q: I thought in a democracy, the guy with the most votes wins.

A: True, in a democracy. But America is not a democracy. In America in 2000,
the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins.

Q: So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President?

A: He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure
that the will of the people is less and less respected. Soon lawless
justices may constitute 6-3 or even 7-2 on the court.

Q: Is there any way to stop this?

A: YES. No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate. It
takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. If only 41 of the 50 Democratic
Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not
approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be
democratically elected in 2004, the judicial reign of terror can end....and
one day we can hope to return to the rule of law.

Q: What do I do now?

A: Email this to everyone you know, and write or call your senator,
reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes (three
times Kennedy's margin over Nixon) and that you believe that VOTERS rather
than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote.
And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people, you
want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until 2004 when a president is finally
chosen by most of the American people.

Expect a phone call from Goldman Sachs/Constellation about our wind company.  
They want to know the details of the sale process.

Thanks.

Jeff,

 I reserved a place on your calendar tomorrow to go over the Northwest Shelf 
bid proposal.  Attached is a brief powerpoint file describing my view on how 
we should think about this transaction.  I'll bring along a copy in case you 
don't get a chance to look at it.

Thanks,
Brad

Subject: Re: PADD V-California Gas Injection  

Anthony,

 Here is what I can add:

1. Looks like the Conventional Steam Boilers used by producers in the field 
(average boiler: 50 Million Btu/hr, uses 1400 mmbtu/day of gas) that have 
been shut-in, use approx.. 100,000- 150,000 mmbtu/day of gas  (mainly, 
Texaco, Chevron, and independents).  This number can vary depending on which 
majors have firm transport on the pipelines and don't have to pay spot SOCAL 
Border prices.  This steam generation is used in either Steam Floods or 
Cyclic Steam Operations.
2. Crude production has probably not been affected, but if the injections 
stay down, you could see production start to fall off in 3 or 4 months.  
Crude prices in California are very weak right now (Kern River diffs are 
$10-13 under WTI when they normal run in the $5.80/$6.10 area).  Majors that 
have downstream facilities have outlets for their crude and probably have no 
plans to cut production.  Independents are seeing weakness on the buying side 
for the West Coast Independents and majors that normally buy their crude.  It 
might be 2-3 months before things clean up a bit out there on the crude side.
3. Gas injection-  The question here is due producers decide to risk the 
integrity of their reservoir's by reducing pressure and not injecting the 
gas.  This probably would only be done for a month or two.  Noone wants to 
damage any of their wells.  This volume is not well known, but in the overall 
picture really shouldn't affect prices that significantly.  Usually this gas 
is pretty sour and does not command a high price.  This would also be the 
cheapest source or gas for producers to use (if they bought any make-up gas 
for their process).
4. Referring to the question #2, the majority of EOR methods used in 
California are Steam Floods and Cyclic Steam Processes.  The oil is very 
heavy and needs HEAT in order to recover it out of the ground.  Just 
injecting gas would not accomplish this.  There are a lot of CO-GEN units 
that generate steam for most of the Majors and these are not being shut-in or 
slowed down.  Only sustain high gas prices for 6 months would probably start 
affecting Crude production.  Let's remember that in 1998-9 crude prices were 
extremely low and normal gas prices didn't change what most producers did, 
because if they shut-in too many wells, the production would never come back.

If you have anymore questions, please let me know.   Thanks

Mark

Subject: PADD V-California Gas Injection

Hello, John.

Again, thanks for your cooperation.

Summary:
A West gas trader received news from Seneca Resources stating that California 
crude producers that use natural gas injection (or gas lifting?) for 
secondary and tertiary recovery methods may stop injection and - instead - 
sell the gas into the market to benefit from the record high natgas prices.  
That being so, one wonders how much natural gas will be put back into the 
market and how California crude yields will be affected.  

Here are some specific questions that may help us:
How often is natural gas used in California to enhance crude production 
(including gas injection/lifting, steam injection, and hot water injection)?  
Is this really a significant issue?
What is the law concerning onshore gas injection?  If the gas was bought (not 
produced) by the crude producer, is the crude producer obligated to recover 
the injected gas?  If yes, must 100% of the gas be proven to be recoverable?
On average, how much natgas volume is injected in an oil field to recover 
production?
What is an approximate number of producing oil fields in California and/or 
PADD 5
What is the average size of these crude reservoirs?
How many of these fields use natgas for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) - 
reiterating question #1?
Is there a unit estimate of approximately how many MMBtus/Mcfs of natgas is 
needed to produce 1 barrel of crude onshore?
How would stopping gas injection/lifting affect crude supply in California? 
Would crude wells be shut-in?  If so, how would that affect future efforts to 
produce from them?
Will a significant amount of crude be held from the market - especially in 
the PADD 5/Western region?
What commodities are substitutes for natgas in secondary/tertiary EOR and how 
liquid are they in the West?  How feasible, expeditious, and economical is it 
for any producing oil field to use another substance for EOR?

John, I really appreciate your willingness to help unearth this information.  
The priority on this matter is urgent, so we would be extra grateful for a 
prompt response.  Please do not hesitate to call me at 713-853-6304, Russell 
Dyk at 713-853-7332, or Ken Shulklapper at 713-853-7009 for any further 
questions or comments.

Sincerely,

Anthony

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat

Dear Celeste and Kristin:

I am re-sending information regarding the Wharton Entrepreneurship
Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as
participate in the Expo.  We are expecting the conference to double in
size with more than 1000 attendees.  In addition, we would like to
emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside
of the "dot.com" world including in large, innovative companies such as
Enron.  We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including
Christy Jones of Trilogy and PCOrder as well as Anita Roddick of The
Body Shop.  We would be very interested to have the participation of
Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a
participant in our career expo.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Cassandra Santos

Jeff,

I wanted to send you a copy of the presentation we have given to the
following banks in London last week:

ANZ
Christiana
Chase
ING Barings
NIB (small niche shipping Dutch bank)
BNP Paribas
Citibank
ABN AMRO

I wanted to set up meetings with a combination of Enron's tier 1 banks and
niche shipping banks.  Andrew Makk,
myself, Pierre Aury, Andy James and Simon Crowe (works for Paul Chivers)
attended the meetings from Enron's side.
Simon did a good job coordinating all the meetings and we were well
received in terms of banks agreeing with our value
proposition.  We marketed to them in regard to being able to provide risk
management solutions for their loan portfolio and
asked for their input regarding the shipping market today and in the near
term.  Pierre and Andy were very appreciative of the
information and effort to help their business.  It was a very good learning
experience for the Enron team.  We have solid leads
with each of the banks.  I will let you know if I hear of anything further.

On another note we will be meeting with Fuji and CSFB next week to hear
their updated input on how best to finance
the Jose project.  We have also been visiting with multiple people in
London related to the Sutton Bridge structure and several new ideas.
Andrew
and I have also been visiting with Eric Gonzales in regard to our options
to extract maximum value as soon as possible from the Jose project.
I hope all is well and I sent a similar message to Mike.

Regards,

-Larry-

Hi John, hope things are well...Hickerson and I were talking yesterday about 
the convert bond desk, and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to 
come to his group.  I understand you have had prelim discussions about this, 
and wanted to catch up with you on this matter.  I'll give you a ring by

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte

Hi Chris- thanks for getting on the horn with Harvard last week- because we 
know they are already long the spreads, we will have to work on them amending 
the position or putting more on longer term.

Below is feedback from another fund- Tudor, who we trade a lot with- same 
thing- we will have to work on other ideas.  I am getting a bit more 
comfortable with the flow of crude and appreciate your help on ideas.

These guys generally look at us as nat gas/ power only but are very willing 
to trade crude/ products- just need to build credibility.

Talk to you later,

Subject: BRENT/WTI spread


Dwight/Jason-

We have done some analysis on the Brent / WTI spread- we would recommend
buying WTI/ selling Brent for 2Q01 (as well as 02 and 03).

We looked back to 1995 to see how each 2Q of these years traded 1 year
prior to it being prompt.  The graph attached gives the raw data and the
word doc some risk/ reward analysis (1995 was a weird year).

(See attached file: Brent_TI Analysis.xls)(See attached file:
Brent_WTI-Trade.doc)

The spread is pretty constant at 1.25- 1.40 up until the contracts are
prompt- then the average is more like 1.80.  2000 was particularly striking
because of the gasoline shortage in the Mid West which put pressure on WTI
at Cushing (and in general kept cracks high)- we got out to 2.70.  We are
looking for a repeat this year.  The Arb has generally moved to 2.70
minimum (to bring Brent to Cushing) because of higher freight rates this
year- this looks to continue.

The spread has moved out the last few days as Dec Brent is getting tight
(due to UK tax affect)- now 1.52 at 1.57

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.
Rgds,
CA

Jeff,

We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the 
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from 
what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that 
John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact 
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not 
allow it, so he was using 0.999.

We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If 
you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just 
let me know what time would be convenient.

Subject: EnronCredit Move

John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.


1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.


I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Darren Adamik

Subject: Venezuela LNG

Randy- Emilio and I had a vigorous debate today over the content and 
conclusions of the CABC Group's analysis of the questions you asked about the 
political and regulatory situation in Venezuela.  He expressed a number of 
areas of concern, some pertaining to the tone of the paper and others to its 
accuracy.

I acknowledged his concerns and promised to do my best to improve the tone 
and clarify any inaccuracies.  We will revisit with our sources to clarify 
the following issues:

1. Will the new Hydrocarbons Law just address liquid hydrocarbons or will it 
address gas hydrocarbons?  What details are available on the proposed law?
2. If the new law does affect gas, will it in effect overturn the 1999 Gas 
Law?
3.  Will gas tariffs be separate for transportation, distribution, and 
upstream, or will there be a single unified tariff?  Is there a dispute 
between PDVSA and the  Ministry of Mines and Energy on how this should be 
handled?
4. What is the current royalty and tax structure on gas?  Will it be affected 
by the new HydroCarbons Law?
5. What are the current renegotiation dynamics of the Cristobal Colon project 
between the government and foreign operators?

Once we have revisited with sources, I told Emilio that we will be happy to 
correct any subsequent errors.  However, if we reconfirm the information in 
the paper then perhaps the three of us can confer on how to proceed.

This has been a difficult assignment because we are essentially dealing with 
areas that are subject to interpretation and forecasting.  Emilio and I 
disagreed in some areas about the Chavez agenda, while agreeing in others.  
Also, because the HydroCarbons Law has not yet been written, we can only go 
on what sources in country are saying.  Clearly, we have conflicting 
information and will work to clear up the contradictions ASAP.

I suggest we postpone our Thursday meeting until both Emilio and I have time 
to conduct further follow-ups.  As I have said to both you and Emilio, the 
CABC role here is not to take any position on the merits of the deal, but 
rather to answer the specific concerns brought up by RAC.  Hopefully, these 
next steps will resolve the situation in mutually satisfying manner.

Mr. Shankman:

     I am Dan Reck's new administrative assistant.  I initially interviewed
with Jennifer and Shanna Funkhouser and knew that they were both special.
However, since I have been here (an entire 5 days now!), Jennifer has been
invaluable to me.  On my first day at my desk, she called and asked me to
come to her office and she introduced me to Cathy Phillips and Yolanda
Martinez.  The reason for this e-mail is that I have encountered some
employee problems at my location and have confided in Jennifer.  Her
professionalism, eloquence and intelligence belies her youth.  As I am sure
you are aware, Jennifer is a diamond and she will only shine brighter as
her experience grows.  Life is short and I was raised to say nice things
when warranted.  I am so impressed with Jennifer  and I am proud and feel
privileged to be a member of her team.  Thank you for your time.

		 Subject: Asian Credit Alert- AP & P

The Asian Pulp & Paper debt situation is once again becoming critical to 
Asian growth prospects.  AP & P is the most popular Asian bond holding among 
foreign investors.  AP & P narrowly met a Feb.1 deadline for a debt payment 
and has a 30 day grace period on another which runs out at the end of 
February.  Depressed pulp and paper prices and a high risk premium for 
Indonesian debt raise serious doubts about AP & P's ability to meet this 
payment.

The ripple effect of an AP &P default or government-imposed restructuring 
would be significant for Asian credit and equity markets, with possible 
contagion effects for other emerging markets.  We will continue to update 
this issue in the days ahead.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 49/2000




Highlight

The freight market for cape and panamax size vessels appear to be on the 
verge of a significant downward correction.  The news from Japan and the 
Asian economies as a whole is bleak with fear of more bankruptcies looming 
and low to flat growth projections. Furthermore, the US economy is showing 
strong signs that it has peaked.  As a result, ship owners are openly worried 
about demand for next year and are desperately seeking cargo contracts while 
rates are still attractive.  The cape time charter rate has lost more than $ 
3,000 over the last 3 weeks and Panamaxes have lost $ 1,500.  On the cape 
side, Bocimar is unable to prevent the index sliding even though they still 
control 60 ships ( on Friday index fell 33 pts, single biggest point drop 
ever recorded ) and other owners are fighting for the few spot cargoes still 
unfixed before the Christmas break. 

Of significance, we fixed on subs a four cargo contract with Bao Steel ( one 
of the biggest Chinese steel mills ) that runs into March 2002 from Brazil 
into China and also fixed a a four panamax contract with Adaro from Indonesia 
to Spain, which is on subs until or if Adaro sells the coal into Spain.

Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there 
were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial 
team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar 
recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 
contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless 
weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we 
are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting 
function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, 
given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, 
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be 
accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in 
their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all 
responsibility going forward. 

I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.

Jeff

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 43/2000




Highlight
The cape market continues to rise almost daily with RBCT to Rotterdam at 
$11.40 and Quennsland to Rotterdam at $15.5 in the spot market.  The driving 
factor has not been coal as of late, but an unexpected rush of Iron Ore 
cargoes.  On the panamax front, rates have been easing for the last few 
weeks, as the expected strong grain activity in the US gulf as not yet 
materialised.  The average time charter rate on capes is now in excess of 
$25,000 daily and close to $11,000 on panamaxes.  The general view in the 
market is that prices for both capes and panamaxes will remain strong though 
to April/May 2001 by which time steel mills will have reduced raw material 
imports and adversely affected cape rates and the shear number of 
newbuildings on the panamax front will drag earnings down as well.  Our group 
tends to believe that the balance of the year will see yet firmer rates but 
we expect a slow down and a decrease in rates to take effect towards the 
first two months of next year as we already are seeing some owners 
desperately seeking to cover themselves for next year at very aggressive 
numbers ( Hadeed contract ) and we are getting the feeling that Bocimar is 
keenly interested to cover their long position even tough their length is 
mainly through March/April next year.  Furthernore, the asian owners seem 
more and more agressive with rates for next year as their countries are 
hitting some rough patches currently, as evidenced by their stock markets and 
strong comments against continued strong crude oil prices.

On the ABC front, it appears as if Zodiac and P&O have agreed in principal to 
a deal by which Zodiac buys 50% of ABC but gets full control of the company.  
Details are still patchy and we are keeping a close eye on the possibility of 
Zodiac putting their newly acquired vessels into the Bocimar pool as that 
would have a drastic bullish effect on rates for some months to come.  We 
have proposed to Bocimar a 5 year collar deal by which we get access to 5 
million tons of freight each year with ability to settle the collar deal 
against an index and have the ability to call upon physical tonnage each 
year.  Furthermore, we would have ability to have a washout clause for each 
year by which we would pay a fix lump sum cash amount.   We have also built 
in several other options and we are waiting for an answer from Bocimar 
sometime next week.  This deal would offer us access to modern vessels at a 
price similar to that of the cape index of the last 10 years and with enough 
built in options to take advantage of any sudden market changes.

On the logistics front, Coeclerici is coming in next week to make a 
presentation on their port handling operations in India/ Indonesia and 
Venezuela with the idea of teaming up with us on forthcoming tenders where we 
would offer the long term coal contracts into or out of certain ports, as the 
case maybe, and they would build and manage the port operations.  They 
currently have some interesting contracts in Indonesian ports which should 
have special interest to us vis a vis CLP.  

Our two cape deals with Coeclerici are still not finalised as we are still 
having a few issues with credit language but expect the deals to close within 
the next 10 days.

On the EOL front, Andy James has been able to get EDFtrading to trade 225,000 
tons of freight via EOL this week and he has added Louis Dreyfus grain and 
Billiton and RWE trading to the list of customers that have trading authority 
on our system.

Regarding the lighter side of business, Enron dry bulk shipping was featured 
in tradewinds, a weekly shipping  newspaper, with 3 pages dedicated to our 
rapid growth and clever insights.

I think this may be the junior trader your are looking for. If you don't want 
him -- I will certainly interview him for fundamentals, but I think he is 
over qualified

Sir Fraser,


In June 2001 I will graduate from the University of Chicago with a Master of
Science degree in Financial Mathematics.
I have graduated from the IFP (French Institute of Petroleum) Engineering
School in Paris with a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Economics.

I am very interested in a career in Energy markets and I would like to know
more about your activities in the Energy markets.

Would it be possible to schedule an informational interview at your
convenience ?

I am attaching my resume to give you some background about myself.
I thank you for your consideration and I hope to hear form you soon.

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=
st=20
week.
>From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=
on=20
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=
=20
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=

Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=

expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=

market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=

mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=
=20
More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=
=20
the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=
e=20
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=
=20
injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=
=20
futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=
=20
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=
n=20
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=
=20
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=
er.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20
heating load
from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=
h CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=
=20
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=
=20
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=
e=20
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=
=20
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
=20
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=
ng=20
AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

I've asked craig breslau on the gas floor--a senior marketer (VP) who is well 
versed in this to give the lunch.  Pete De Leeuw was happy a senior Enron 
person could get there on short notice.

Please print following on letterhead:

Larry Kellner
Chief Financial Officer
(put rest here)

Dear Larry,

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday.  
Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add 
even more value as we explore your basis risks.  I've asked Mark Tawney, 
Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly 
linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities.  
His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge 
research.  

We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but 
I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate 
relationship.  If there is anything else I can do, please call. 

It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier.  
Again thanks for your time.

Regards,

Subject: ARA Coal Mkt Summary

SUMMARY

The market has definitely come under pressure since the dizzy heights of of a 
fortnight ago where producers were still standing firmly 
behind $33 per metric on a FOB Richards Bay equivalent and claiming it was 
heading swiftly to $35. While there had been some nervous
short covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had  
fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined and
in general have refused to commit to these numbers. The lack of business at 
these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and of
course mkt psychology with it. While producers are still playing lip service 
to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which 
reflect levels of $31 FOB Richards Bay and wud trade down to $30.50. Several 
sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days that
negotiations between Kepco and South African producers for price fixing 2001 
tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will be
an additional 3 million mt which the South Africans have to find a home for - 
destination Europe most likely. On the flip side Kepco will
be looking towards Indonesia and China to substitute this tonnage and this 
combined with rumours that Formosa Plastic will be looking
for some 3 million tonnes of additional material from China cud serve to 
tighten the Pacific mkt over the next months for first half 2001.
There is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand 
against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over 
last three weeks with business being booked out of the U.S, Indonesia and 
Australia at numbers close to what was achievable from
S.A. into Europe. This can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this 
mktplace and indeed German utilities who have been held to 
ransom by similar minded producers in Poland are now exploring every end to 
do business with other suppliers - namely ourselves 
in order to avoid being captive to one supplier. Weglekoks incidentally are 
currently in the mkt buying Russian material to cover sales 
made against Polish to Bewag - we don't want to be short Polish in the near 
term!

Mkt now trading at $41.25 Fob barge ARA for Jan/Dec 2001and $42.15 level for 
the Jan/Mar 2001. We still see couple dollars on the
downside although the latest incident (guerrilla attack on rail line last 
week) has Gary Drummond threatening to cut production down

EOL Update

Total EOL trades for November stand at 1.95 million mt out of a running total 
of 3.67 million from it's inception. As the figures suggest 
there is increasing activity/liquidity in the market with the arrival of 
several new players in recent weeks - most notably AEP. Increased 
volume in EOL has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of SECA's 
traded in the OTC market with more and  more utilities
who have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party - RWE 
has been the latest SECA virgin to lose it's cherry closing
a deal with ourselves early last week on Q1 through TFS. We are now offering 
our products in Euros aswell the good old green back
much to the confusion of one or two of our clients! At current pace we shud 
have surpassed all our expectations by passing the 5 mill
mark by the end of the year.

GAMEPLAN 

We are currently long to the tune of 1.5 mil mt but this is essentially all 
through optionality at origin which runs through to 2004.
Strip these out and effectively we are running a short ARA position of some 
1.5 mill mt  weighted pretty evenly across Q2, Q3 and Q4
2001 backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage 
out of both Richards Bay and Drummond. We are 
very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to 
go after the term Cal 01 business while running a European
short pos'n which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both 
the frt mkts and in the Atlantic coal mkt. Shud the the 
European mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the 
money options which we wud utilise to execute any
physical shorts in ARA and to keep mkt capped. 

Best Regards
Jez

Good morning team,

First,  I want to thank you for helping with on campus interviews last week 
at Wharton.  

To conclude the process I have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday November 14th 
at 9am in room 11C2 to discuss candidate invites for Super Saturday.  It is 
imperative that we meet to discuss who you will be passing on to the final 
round of interviews.  With the holidays coming up the sooner we get letters 
out for invites the better our results might be for attendance.  If you can 
not make this meeting please call me as soon as possible at extension 53214.  
Otherwise I will see you tomorrow.

Natalie if you can please respond with a call in number we will patch you 
into the meeting.

Thank you,

Kristin Gandy

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 02/2001




Highlight

The cape market continues to slide ever southward with owners unable to 
repeat last done on rates obtained.  Richards bay to Rotterdam rates have 
fallen about $2 in 45 days ( key coal route )  and Brazil to China rates have 
fallen $3 in the same period ( key iron ore route ) which has owners running 
for cargo  coverage.  However charterers smell blood and are not willing to 
enter into freight contracts ( Edf trading and NCSC  are playing spot and so 
are we ).  Even the mighty Bocimar seems unable to turn the tide and are 
offering us cheap rates on the quiet as they keep playing their vessels spot 
and are  being run over.  The average cape rate has lost $ 4200 from its peak 
and hangs around $20,400 presently.  To get cargo contracts for the balance 
of the year an owner has to fix his vessel at around $16,000 to get 
charterers willing to agree.  The downward fall is the result of two 
concurrent market shifts 1- coal shipments into Europe have slowed 2- market 
is predicting that sometime in Q1 2001 , Japanese steel mills will cut back 
on production and reduce their raw material imports.  As a result, you have 
on one side, Japanese vessel owners panicking as they fear that their main 
account ( Japan ) will not need their vessels shortly and you have the 
European owners also worried as they are seeing their utilities postponing 
their coal requirements.  Furthermore, the holiday season in Asia is 
approaching and little activity is predicted for the next few weeks.

On the panamax front, the outlook is still very bleak as you now have about 
two new buildings being launched per week in a market which is currently well 
balanced.  In the spot market, the Atlantic is weak as the grain out of the 
US gulf is slow as the main rivers are frozen upstream and the vessels have 
little to load.  In the east the market is strong as there is a flurry of 
grain activity but in the paper market, February is already traded at a big 
discount to Jan as people predict a quick slowdown in the activity as Asia 
goes on holiday.

On the long term strucutred front, last week we agreed to charter a new cape 
building starting in late 2003 for 10 years with an option for an 11th, 12 
th, 13 th and 14 th year.  Furthermore, we have the option to buy the vessel 
after year 3 at a fixed agreed Japanese yen amount ( if currency goes our 
way, we buy the vessel dirt cheap !!!).  The counterparty in Mitsui, a big 
and financially strong Japanese company.  The deal is still subject a few 
details but we hope to be able to book this deal within the next 5 months 
when the ship building contract will be drawn up.

Also last week we had about 6 banks over a period of three days come to our 
office to discuss possible opportunities in the shipping world and to get 
them to trade on EOL.  Larry Lawyer and Simon Crowe organized the meetings 
and we expect a few of these leads to pay off sometime this year.

Jonathan Miller 
Kentucky State Treasurer 

December 2000 

Dear Friends, 

? ? Amidst all the holiday hoopla, I want to take a moment to sincerely thank 
you for helping make my first year in office a productive and joyous one. 
?Your interest and support have been critical to our success in making 
Treasury an office of which we can be justly proud. Consider some of the 
developments we have seen over the past year: 

? Prepaid Tuition: The office has been surging with added activity following 
the unanimous passage in the 2000 legislative session of our prepaid tuition 
bill -- the one that the Courier-Journal noted "may be remembered as the most 
lasting achievement of the session's education panels." ?Since then, we have 
named the program KAPT, Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition Plan, (Catchy 
Slogan: Keep College Costs Capped!) and convened our 12-member board to 
oversee its administration. We are on track for a Fall 2001 launch and expect 
KAPT to be extremely popular among Kentucky families who are looking for 
affordable ways to send their kids to college. 

? Unclaimed Property: That moving and shaking you hear is a direct result of 
Unclaimed Property's entry into the Digital Age. ?Less than three months ago, 
claims were processed manually -- a cumbersome task, to say the least. ?But 
that was then. ?Now that Unclaimed Property has interfaced with ?the state's 
centralized accounting system, efficiency has soared. ?No fuzzy math here. 
?We have paid 7,036 claims from January 1 through November 30th -- more than 
double the year before. ?And with the addition of a search function on our 
web site which allows claimants to look for property online, we were able to 
give back over 3 million dollars to rightful owners. ?This marks the best 
year in the history of the Unclaimed Property Program. 

? Accounting: When I first started in my position last January, the state's 
accounting system found Treasury behind in bank reconciliation -- balancing 
the state's accounting transactions with its depository transactions. ?Within 
three weeks, we forged an alliance with the Finance Cabinet to solve the 
problem. ?Less than one year later, we can claim complete success. ?It's 
official: All of Treasury's bank accounts have been reconciled. ?? 

? Systems: Treasury has given the phrase "the check's in the mail" new 
meaning. ?The year 2000 saw our savvy tech staff usher in a new era with the 
adoption of state-of-the-art, check-sealing equipment. ?This means that 
checks are processed and transmitted to taxpayers more efficiently. ?It also 
means that the age of smoke and fire alarms in the Capitol Annex due to 
faulty equipment is finally over! 

? Public Outreach: Treasury has made great strides to improve communication 
with the public. ?We continue to develop Treasury's new and improved web 
site, with a special emphasis on making www.kytreasury.com more user-friendly

office was 269% over the 1999 participation rate for the Kentucky Employees' 
Charitable Campaign. ?Our spirited employees gave to the fund in more ways 
than one. Exhibit A is Treasury's fundraising softball team. ?Word is that 
out on the field, we made the Department of Agriculture actually look like a 
farm team. ?For its outstanding efforts, Treasury was recognized by KECC and

Subject: FPL meeting

Jeff, we talked last week about Ozzie Pagan coming to the FPL meeting.  My 
thoughts are that the deals Ozzie are talking about it are great and could 
very well be a part of what we do with the LNG deal, but I doubt the meeting 
will get to that level of detail.  If we get the LNG deal and a possible gas 
transaction on to FPL's radar screen, then we will have accomplished alot.  
Having Ozzie there as Enron's Florida power project developer may be too 
distracting.  As part of the many follow-up  meetings we will hope to have 
with FPL, Ozzie can make his pitch to them.

If you concur, I'll let Ozzie know.

Thanks

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 46/2000




Highlight

The panamax market has fallen about $1,000 over the last two weeks on basis 
of time charter rates.  For next year, owners have turned on average quite 
bearish and several are calling us directly to offer us their vessels at 
discounted numbers.  Interestingly, cape vessel owners have been watching the 
falling panamax market with trepidation.  Currently, the spread between the 
two sectors is about $13,000.  Over the last three days, time charter rates 
for cape size vessel for 12 months starting in January 2001 have dropped by 
approximately $1200 and brokers attribute the rapid decline to the 
unsustainable spread between the two vessel types.

Of significant interest this week, Bocimar called us to price put options for 
them.  They told us that they wanted some protection for next year but could 
not buy puts or sell swaps in the market place for fear of creating a panic 
selling mode from owners.  We offered them some prices which they told us 
were too expensive but we are still in discussion.  Our problem is that we do 
not want to diminish our short position for next year so in offering put 
options to Bocimar, we also want to keep selling the underlying - and that 
might be challenging as the market is very illiquid and there are not too 
many bids for next year at good selling numbers.

We are currently continuing to build a short position on panamaxes and are 
offering rates to AK Steel from Brazil to US gulf for their iron ore 
contracts and also offering Sidmar ( the Belgian steel mill ) some rates from 
Brazil into Gent.  We might join forces with Coeclerici on several of these 
tenders to mitigate the risk and also to share market information.

last but not least, we are studying the idea of taking a cape new building 
delivery 2003/2004 on time charter for 8 years with ability to extend for 
three additional years and the ability to buy the vessel after year three in 
Japanese yen.  The time charter rate is very attractive when compared to the 
average time charter rate of this size vessel over the last 5 and 10 years.  
Will keep you posted.

On another HR matter, I thought I'd tell you about Jannie Bonnard in the old 
Calme group.  Her work (for PRC and bonus process) was poor at best, late, 
and disorganized, and frequently wrong.  I can't imaging sending her to EES 
is a good idea.  I would terminate her.  

Sorry for the downer on this one.

Jeff

Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's 
plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could 
have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up 
the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India 
from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions 
related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone 
may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a 
relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling 
this terminal

We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any 
thoughts or suggestions

Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company  

Rick, we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week. Metgas 
is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC 
is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year 
end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any 
changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is 
heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.

The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through 
Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that 
Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of 
terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real 
value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has 
control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under 
current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity 
position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with 
someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable 
with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG 
role, we should discuss ASAP.

AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with 
Rick and Clay.

Wade

Bill/Wade:  I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact 
Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.  If an LNG 
competitor buys in (e.g., Total or British Gas or Shell) could they block our 
acces to the terminal?

Clay,

As you know, we are selling portions of both Dabhol and Metgas.  For fuel 
supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have 
BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of 
Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way 
the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with 
the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to 
negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there 
should be attractive commercial returns with each project.

I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.  
If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly.

Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.


Bill

Clay,
Thanks for the information on DPC. IPIC's current focus on India is to
identify investments with related crude, naphtha or gas supply needs which
could be filled by Adnoc or Adgas, with priority currently assigned to
Adnoc's naphtha. IPIC would also be looking for a commercial return, BOD
participation & strong minority shareholder protection. Does the DPC
opportunity fit this profile? If so IPIC could certainly look at it...

Best Regards

Tom,
I am the commercial team lead for recruiting at Wharton and I'd like to 
invite you to speak on a panel at the Wharton Entrepreneurship Conference on 
Friday, December 1 in Philadelphia.  We are the platinum sponsors of the 
conference and really want to have a panelist like you, who exemplifies the 
innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities at Enron.  The timing of the 
panel is essential to recruiting - later that day candidates will be coming 
to Houston for Super Saturday.  The panel topic is Intrapreneurship, Being an 
Entrepreneur within a Corporation.  Other panelists include Dan Powers, 
Director of IBM Early Stage Internet
Technology along with someone from American Express' Strategy/Business 
Development side.  Jonathan Seelig, founder and Sr. VP Strategy of Akamai is 
the keynote speaker of the conference.  Speaking on the panel would entail 
flying up to Philadelphia on the afternoon of Thursday, Nov. 30 and attending 
the opening cocktail reception from 7-8:30pm.  They keynote address is from 
6-7pm, if you would like to attend that as well.  The panel itself is from 10 
- 11:15 am on Friday, December 1, so you could be back in Houston as early as 
4:45.  If you would like additional information, Their website is 
www.wec2000.net.  Could you please give me a call to let me know if you would 
be able to participate in the conference?

jeff,we have bought approx. 2.75mmbbls. of dec crude and reduced heat cracks 
300mb. This means we should be close to our var limits
but not sure if under. Secondly,products has var coming from heat cracks (we 
got hit on EOL for 975 mb  on friday),jet swaps  (also EOL earlier
last week  of about 1mm bbl.),and some gasoline cracks in 2002.Otherwise our 
products positions on both dides of the Atlantic are as small
as anytime in recent history.

Subject: ARA Coal Mkt Summary

MKT SUMMARY

The producers did not dissapoint at Coaltrans with evidence as early as 
Monday afternoon that they had managed to whip up
a bullish frenzy amongst most of the industry participants. However the fact 
remains that fundamentals have changed little 
in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this 
mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a 
firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt 
market still steeply inverted for the winter versus
the rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt 
experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coast
trading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 
2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec
2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the 
origin markets are structured in a steep contango for
the remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation 
aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anything
demand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down 
and the financial markets under pressure and forecasts
for European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked 
sell off for second half of the year is unlikely we
see the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than 
contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higher
of absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 
Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is still
plenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will 
end up buying into it rather than risk the wait and
see game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that 
the cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated
it's implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.

SPOT TRADES 

150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo 
basis 6000 kcal/kg
160,000mt of Prima  quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo 
basis 6400 kcal/kg
150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at 
$30.65 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg.
2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively. 
Strike price  is $40.50 basis Amsterdam/
Rotterdam and expiry is Feb 15 and Aug 15. Premium - $0.50 cents.


SELLING SIDE

British Energy - pitching a 1,3 and 5 year deal to them as an extension to 
current contract we have with them which runs out
end March.
Scotts Power - looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to  FOR 
deal and sell incremental cape for March 
arrival.
H Del C - offering them a 9 year put option basis the SECA.
Endessa - we have offered them 4 plus 1 cape business  for 2001 based on $31 
Fob South Africa.
NCSC - looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising 
EOL in the next week to hedge some of their 
implied short position.
Heidelberger - offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for 
November delivery at $47.50.
Bremen - shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen 
supplying them some 850,000mt of generic
quality coal on an annual basis.
Bewag - currently working an offer to supply 1 million mt for 2001 on 
delivered stockpile basis
ENBW/Neckarverke/Preag - offering Oz material for Nov/Dec just shy of $43 fob 
ARA.
Braunschweig - offered them 3 x 60,000mt for Mar/Jun/Jly delivery into 
Nordenham at $43.75 cif.
 Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for 
April/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge.


BUYING SIDE

Duiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us 
buying a cape a quarter for 2001 - they are due to get
back to us within the next few days.
Drummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 2002 at $35 Fob Colombia - 
thanks!!
Krutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of 
Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian
mkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our 
portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business
going forward.
Anker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for 
2001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fob
Maputo level.
Masefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa 
Marta for 2001.
Coal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out 
of Durban for 2001
Currently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for 
2001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.00 apart.


We currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in 
Amsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backend
of the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 
26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell into
the mkt.

EOL

Much of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from 
GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch 
an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA 
delivery point. Details of operational functionality
are scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they 
themselves do not know but general consensus reckons
it will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as 
competition, if successful it could provide us with more access
to markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games 
to be had with the various producers.  

Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of 
interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt 
conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money 
options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal 
players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which 
increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros and
after that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.

GAMEPLAN

We had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of 
which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between
$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and 
Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South
African material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 
2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -
our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is 
out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mkt
in either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any 
downside potential with a host of put options which the utilities
are keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we 
need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better
shape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of 
diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.
While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of 
an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as
much flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.

Best Regards
Jez

The frost damage from June 2000 accounts for a 75 percent crop loss in Para=

Subject: Re:  

Bobby retires this month, but will continue as a consultant to Enron India.  
His stated intention is to shadow Clay and his team to help arrange LNG 
supplies for Metgas.  We do not need this and it adds a layer of confusion 
whenever he is in attendance in negotiations, but to date neither Wade nor 
Sanjay has been willing or able to control this.  The India group tends to 
blame their failure to market Metgas supplies on the LNG team's "failure" to 
get better terms, and they insist that Bobby or others attend the meetings to 
ensure that we are doing a good job.

We believe that we have obtained LNG for Metgas on favorable terms, 
particularly in light of the fact that we have convinced Malaysia and Abu 
Dhabi to accept the credit risk of Metgas customers, i.e., with no Ennron 
support in the middle and no Indian government support behind the buyers).  
They believe that our supplies are priced 50 cents above the "market", which 
they perceive to be Qatari supplies to Petronet ( a proposed 
government-backed LNG import project in Western India that is a long way from 
being real).    

We believe that we know the pricing terms for the proposed Petronet deal and 
that the price is not as low as rumored.  We also believe that the Metgas 
customers are willing to pay the price that we have negotiated and that the 
Metgas pipeline economics are sound (although the India group has been 
unwilling to share their economics with us) and that, once the LNG contracts 
are in place, we can reduce the LNG price significantly via a backhaul from 
Malaysia using ADGAS/TEPCO ships.   We can further reduce the price if we can 
get access to the spare capacity on the ship dedicated to DPC and use it to 
move incremental cargoes from Abu Dhabi to Metgas.

Bobby and his team want us to reopen the price in the Mayasia term sheet.  We 
do not intend to do this.  Malaysia has told us that they will walk the deal 
if we insist on a lower price.  Malaysia recently sold additional volumes to 
Japan for a price about 20 cents higher than the price to Metgas and they 
believe they can also sell our volumes at a higher price to more creditworthy 
buyers in the far east.

The Malaysia COI includes a cp that Metgas will finalize contracts with its 
end buyers by Sep 1999.  We have repeatedly  gotten Malaysia to extend this 
target date, which is now end October 2000, but Malaysia is getting impatient 
with India and I am not sure how much longer we can hold this together 
without some more firm evidence from India that the markets are real

I will be in India on Oct 4/5 to meet with Sanjay and Wade to discuss this.  
We will also try to finalize the terms for us to provide LNG  fuel management 
and shipping services to both DPC and Metgas, and will seek clarification 
from Wade/Sanjay as to how they intend to sell down DPC/Metgas without losing 
control of the LNG terminal.  Clay, V V RAo and Wayne Perry will be with me.

Working with India is never easy

Rick

I'm hearing a little noise about Bobby Ferris in Sanjay's group.  Did he

We are pleased to announce the following within EGM:

The Convertible Bond Arbitrage desk will be moving from EnronCredit.com to 
the Equity desk under Gary Hickerson, and will be managed by Mike Bradley.  
Billy Lemmons has joined Gary Hickerson's unit as well.  He is exploring the 
agriculture value chain and outlining our risk management, (What else here?)

Dan Reck will be transitioning out of the coal group and will be exploring 
our rail and trucking initiatives.  These markets together represent 
approximately $105 billion notionally, and we believe there are many 
synergies between our energy, coal, and freight trading businesses.  In 
addition, we have asked (Pierre Aury to run our worldwide vessel trading 
businesses.  Scott Moncrief will be responsible for all liquids vessel 
businesses reporting to Pierre)  (should we mention cement here under george 
mclellan?)

Our worldwide weather operations will continue to report to Mark Tawney in 
Houston, and he will have all V@R  allocation responsibility between Sydney, 
Tokyo, Oslo, and Houston.  In addition we will be forming a weather marketing 
desk in London.

Janelle Scheuer will be joining the Global Products from Enron America's East 
power origination group, and is responsible for developing a mid-market 
business specifically for our liquids businesses.  She will be reporting to 
John Nowlan.  Bill White will be coming over from EBS and has responsiblity 
for all U.S. financial crude trading.  Don Schroeder will continue to have 
oversight of our physical crude business.  

Anything else?

Hi Jeff-
Has my Spec Markets professor been in touch with you yet?  I gave him your
card last week and he said he would contact you.  In case you want to
reach him directly, his contact info is:

Leonid Kogan
Assistant Professor of Finance
The Wharton School,
University of Pennsylvania
Phone: 215-898-7617
e-mail: lkogan@wharton.upenn.edu

On another note, all of campus was delighted that Billybob's reopened
today.  It is now run by his widow, since Billybob himself was shot last
Summer (as you remember, they found him in the walk-in freezer).  The
decor is back to the traditional "ghetto style," which means no more pink
walls or bad chinese food.  Forties of malt liquor will return in two
weeks once the liquor license is approved.

Looking forward to seeing you later in the semester...
Matt

Impact on EGM
In August 1999, all NAICS (SIC) codes except Pulp and Paper and Steel 
reverted to EES in September 2000. This includes Refining, Petchems, 
Transport, Chemicals, Coal, Ags, etc...They a model "Value Enhancement" that  
shows an itemized account of a customer's VAR by commodity (metals, plastics, 
petchems,
products, gas, power, etc). They planon covering the whole universe of risk 
management. Obviously we need to manage the relationship with EES.

Next Steps:
Meet with Mike Mann. I have his target list. We probably need to see how we 
help them bring business to the EGM books, since they are cross-selling 
everything.

Let me know what you want to do.

Subject: First Gas Power Corp.

The First Gas Power Corp. (FGPC) liquid fuel supply transaction involves a 
1000 MW (two power blocks of 500 MW each) combined cycle land based power 
plant located on the island of Luzon in the Republic of the Philippines. In 
May, 1997 Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (ECTRI) entered 
into a fuel supply contract with FGPC to start delivering either condensate, 
naphtha or gasoil to the first power block of 500 MW due online in June, 
1999. ECTRI subsequently assigned the fuel contract to Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources Singapore (ECTRS). Fuel deliveries were projected at 40.7 million 
barrels over the following 43 months through December 2002. NPV origination 
of $15.2 million was granted to Enron International (EI) and after 
prudency/credit reserve the book amount given to EI was $11.3 million. ECTRS 
and EI agreed to a "true-up" mechanism that would compensate either party in 
the event of a  mismatch between the actual volumes delivered and the MTM 
volumes. 

Fuel deliveries did not start until April 2000 and have not been at the MTM 
volume of 31,050 barrel per day. To put it in perspective, FGPC should have 
taken delivery on 14.2 million barrels by now and they have only ordered 0.9 
million, a shortfall of 13.3 million barrels. This shortfall, as a result of 
the delayed plant start-up and reduced consumption, has caused the ECTRS 
books to currently have a $6.1 million receivable through the end of August, 
2000. The plant is currently consuming 10,000-12,000 barrels per day, which 
means the receivable will continue to increase until the consumption reaches 
the expected MTM volume. When ECTRS approached EI Asia Pacific for the 
true-up amount we were stonewalled. Following many months of discussion with 
EI about the receivable,  Enron Corp. reorganized EI into global regions, one 
of which was Asia Pacific (APACHI). APACHI said it was not their deal, nor 
had they ever benefited from the deal since the MTM revenue originally went 
to EI and they didn't have money in their budget to return funds to ECTRS, 
regardless of the true-up agreement. Subsequently, Global Fuels meet with 
Rick Buy to discuss this matter. Rick recognized and agreed with our book 
problem, but indicated that Enron Corp. was not prepared to remedy the 
situation. We have been waiting for Corp.'s help ever since. 

 ECTRS did not do anything wrong and yet their books have suffered the 
consequences of a project not living up to it's original estimate. How can 
Enron operating groups grant MTM origination across company lines and not 
expect those regions and projects to live up to the original MTM volumes, 
term and margins granted?

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.

The Weather Risk Management Group will transfer Catherine Woolgar from the 
Oslo office to the Houston office as soon as she is able to transition out of 
her responsibilities in Olso.  In Houston, Catherine will assist in trading 
the US portfolio and be responsible for a number of EOL cities.  Catherine 
has developed a very good understanding of trading weather risk management 
products and the peculiarities of the weather market.

Ross McIntyre in the London Office will continue to provide general support 
to the Oslo office while developing relationships with the commodity desks in 
London and with the market generally.  Additionally, Ross will continue to 
assist in the development of the trade and portfolio analytical systems to be 
utilized globally by the weather desks.

In oder to significantly grow the weather risk management business, we are 
committed to the vision of trading and orginating locally while managing 
globally.  Tthe Weather Risk Management Group ultimately expects to have 
weather trading in most Enron's offices that trade other commodities.  
Accordingly, as soon as commercially feasible, Catherine will return to 
London to work with Ross McIntyre to establish a trading presence in the 
London office.

November 11th (Associates)

If you don't have a preference. I would prefer that you do either November 
4th or 11th.  I think that would be most beneficial.  You are certainly 
welcome to do both but I didn't want to push my luck (smile). Please let me

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will

Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

Charlene

Dear Jeff,

Happy New Year!  I hope that all is well with you and that you are enjoying
your new house.  I heard from Merritt that it looks fantastic.  No surprise
there.

How is life outside of work?  Any plans to come to Europe anytime soon?  Any
chance of seeing you in Stockholm or Copenhagen?

Business here is moving along, much to my surprise.  We have raised the
initial money we need to open our first 4 stores, and are trying to raise
the remainder of the money we need to close out our first round of
financing.  I had hoped that we would sign our first lease before the end of
the 00, but it looks like we will sign sometime very soon.  Locations 2-4
should follow very soon thereafter.

Let me know when you will be in Europe next.  Hope all is well, and look
forward to seeing you soon.  Take care,

Adam

We would like to thank you for your time yesterday allowing us to make you
aware of the Buildscape initiative and potential opportunities for Enron,
Dow and Buildscape to partner and develop the web based services for the
residential building industry in NA that would lead to a tremendous market
offering for the users/customers of the web solution as well as the market
access and services that could be made available through this new business
entity.

The potential synergy of the Buildscape market rollout and web based
technology platform with the Enron capabilities and market making
functionality and Dow's position in the Building industry as a major
manufacturer/supplier would be a powerful combination and I would like to
recommend a follow up meeting to discuss the options around strategic
investment interests and alliance after you have had a chance to regroup
after yesterday's meetings. The possibilities exist today for Enron to join
Dow as a major investor/partner in Buildscape.

Rob, you mentioned that you will be visiting the NAHB show this weekend. Dow
and Buildscape are also participating and our VP for Building Products
Business - John Schaw who was on the original conference call will be there
as well and we would like to arrange a meeting between John and yourself. I
will ask his assistant Marcy Putt to try to contact you and see whether a
meeting can be setup possibly for Saturday.

Jeff,  James Mason and I were also pleased to meet with you to discuss
global market opportunities on a broader sense between Enron and Dow and we
will follow with a meeting between yourself and Pedro Reinhard( CFO) in
Midland at the earliest convenience.

I have attached the Buildscape presentation from yesterday for your review
and follow up to complement the documents previously sent.

 <<BuildscapeEnron.ppt>>

We have completed the preliminary Transammonia valuation analysis with an 
equity range of $70MM to $80MM (enterprise value of $250MM to $260MM).  The 
conditional and non-binding letter to the counterparty will be faxed today 
with an equity range of $60MM to $80MM.  I lowered the bottom end of the 
range to $60MM for negotiation purposes.

Attached is a presentation we've put together focusing on Transammonia's 
business, deal specifics, and our financial valuation.

I don't know why I got a new P&L DPR at 2:30 today showing a change in P&L 
and a big VAR violation--most likely due to shroeder's getting shorter 2186 
contracts of crude and Botchlett's getting shorter 2141 heat contracts.  
Don's Var went up 2.8 million to 9.7 million, and Dave's Var went down only 
687 thousand to 3.1 million.  Where is Dave's var coming from?

We need to be under our Var tonight.  Dave and Don--please take care of 
this.

Hi guys.  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton/Penn recruiting.  In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years.

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't  in 
its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing.  The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program.  I'd be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my 
overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.  

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my rope's end with the program.

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte

Dear Jeff,

Happy (somewhat belated) new year.  I hope you are doing well in sunny
downtown Houston.  I am writing from Princeton where minutes ago I
happily finished my Economics exam, the last of the semester.  In
reviewing the agenda for the rest of the academic year, I thought it
might be a good time to finalize summer plans as well.
     I will be occupied with a job here at Princeton until June 3 - I am
working logistics for part of this year's reunions.  After that date, I
would need only a day or two of turnaround time before coming out to
Houston.  I could conceivably be in the office by Wednesday, June 6.
Depending upon your needs at the office and the possibility of a short
cultural study on a small island off of the coast of western Sumatra, I
could plan on being in Houston until at least early August.  Please let
me know what your plans are on the other end.

There is a new virus - WOBBLER. It  will arrive on e-mail titled CALIFORNIA.
?
IBM and AOL have announced that it  is very powerful, more so than 
Melissa,there is no remedy. It will eat all your  information on the hard 
drive and also destroys Netscape Navigator and Microsoft  Internet Explorer. 
Do not open anything with this title. Not many people seem to  know about 
this yet so propagate it as fast as possible.

If you receive  an e-mail titled "Win A. Holiday" DO NOT open it. It will 
erase everything on  your hard drive. Forward this letter out to as many 
people as you can. This is a  new, very malicious virus and not many people 
know about it. This information  was announced from Microsoft.

DO NOT OPEN "PRETTY PARK." It is a virus  that will erase your whole "C" 
drive. It will come to you in the form of an  e-mail from a familiar person. 
I repeat, DO NOT OPEN. DELETE RIGHT AWAY. It gets  into your address book.

Forward this to everyone in your address book. I  would rather receive this 
warning 25 times than not receive it  once!

Just a short note to touch base on MetGas related activities. We, (the MetGas

Hi, hope things are well.  I'd like to talk about LNG trading vessels  
(merchant).  Have you been  talking with Pierre about all of this activity.   
George Mclellan is concerned about the exmar contract, and wants Pierre more 
involved with the business.  What do you think of this idea?  What are some 
of your thoughts regarding this business.

companies). Inter-company transfers may be masking serious problems within=

=20
owners, the Wijaya family.
o There are clear prospects for collateral damage to Asian capital markets,=
=20
with S&P already cutting ratings and a consequent shrinkage of liquidity.=
=20

APP Risk Profile:

APP=01,s only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset =
sales=20
or a sell-off of pulp and paper inventory. Neither has much chance of=20
success. APP=01,s current strategy is to muscle its bond-holders into a=20
restructuring agreement as soon as possible, most likely before an early=20
March deadline for its next coupon payment falls due. There are significant=
=20
obstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring, from cross-guarantees=
=20
of bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various=20
jurisdictions, to inter-company transfers that present a false picture of=
=20
financial health in some of its operating companies. Such obstacles ensure=
=20
that a restructuring exercise will be lengthy. APP is the fifth largest=20
issuer of junk bonds in the world, and has been regarded as a benchmark bon=
d=20
for Indonesia. Until the last few months, it was the only bond in the world=
=20
that traded at a premium to its own government=01,s bonds, and was the only=
=20
Indonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the=
=20
depth of the Asian crisis. A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian=20
bonds in the event of a default, as investors wait to see what happens to=
=20
unsecured creditors who account for 40 percent to 50 percent of APP=01,s US=
$12=20
billion in debt. At the moment, systemic fallout seems likely to be limited=
=20
to the Asian region, as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri=
ng=20
the Asian financial crisis.=20

APP Key Decision Makers:

The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda=20
Wijaya. No others in the company are privy to all the Group=01,s Affairs, o=
r to=20
corporate strategy. Information is extremely closely held. Sources say that=
=20
the APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive=
=20
understanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o=
f=20
the assets of APP or its subsidiaries, so complex are the cross guarantees=
=20
and trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years.

Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game, engaging i=
n=20
brinkmanship with their bond holders. It signaled the market that it could=
=20
move into a default situation on February 1 when its paper making subsidiar=
y,=20
Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah, failed to make payments on two different bond=
=20
issues worth $43 million. On February 6, APP finally paid the coupon on one=
=20
of the bonds, a US$600 million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius=
,=20
just within a grace period of five business days. If Tjiwi Kimia had failed=
=20
to meet the deadline, it would have triggered cross default clauses on a=20
series of other bonds. The second coupon payment, of $13.5 million, for a=
=20
US$200 million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in 2001, is now late. W=
e=20
expect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment. The=
=20
group is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring. The=
=20
better its cash position is, the more APP will be able to operate from a=20
position of strength in a restructuring negotiation.=20

According to one source: APP is =01&signaling the market and its bond holde=
rs=20
that it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before=20
everything collapse. The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now, while they=
=20
still have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin=
g=20
left.=018 APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another=
=20
because the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies, some =
of=20
which have significant cash flow, is different from those in the parent. Th=
is=20
is obviously a dangerous game, but one in which APP feels it has no choice=
=20
but to engage. The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be, and=
=20
the greater its chances of survival in some form. Trying to keep control of=
=20
the situation so that it doesn=01,t unravel is the name of the game at this=
=20
point. Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their=
=20
non-core subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring. They have been=
=20
actively shopping their China assets for several months, and sources indica=
te=20
that their packaging assets will also go on the block. APP is still hopeful=
,=20
however, of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms.

One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is=
=20
that much of the sales from both companies come from within the group, and=
=20
often these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas. Another source said,=
=20
=01&This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if=
 you=20
start messing with the structure, let=01,s say one group of bond holders wa=
nts=20
to wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer, you could=20
threaten the whole group.=018=20

The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors, and are not in the=20
category of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan, who was=20
sentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and=
=20
corruption. They are not saints =01) the Indonesian government removed the=
=20
Wijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was=20
nationalized in 1999, based on evidence that they exceeded the 30 percent c=
ap=20
for lending to affiliates. However, they depend heavily on international=20
capital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would=
=20
bar future access. At the moment, they have few alternatives to raise cash =
to=20
meet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales. The=
=20
company has built up substantial paper inventory, and according to one=20
source, it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it=
=20
could find a buyer. This is a big if, however, since current prices are=20
depressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make=20
matters worse.

Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments:

An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th=
at=20
APP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets.  These assets include:

o PT Ekamas Fortuna
o PT Purinusa Ekapersada
o Ningbo Zhonghua Paper
o Gold Hongye Paper
o Gold Hai Paper (Kunshan) Co.
o Jin Yu (Qingyuan) Tissue Paper Industry

The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the=
=20
assets on offer, but had held back because of the impenetrable cross=20
guarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an=
=20
acquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity. The=
=20
executive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in=
=20
the context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would=20
finance an acquisition. Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin=
a=20
factories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intra-company prices.=
=20
Once the company is broken up into pieces, it will have to rely on the worl=
d=20
market and will no longer be able to produce at a profit. =20

Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected. It =
is=20
said to remain interested although the price it is willing to pay will be=
=20
considerably less. One of the problems with APP=01,s brinkmanship strategy =
is=20
that it is lowering the value of its assets. Companies will not be willing =
to=20
pay book value when it comes time for the company to sell off its non-core=
=20
assets.=20

Restructuring is imminent, creating opportunities for investors:

o A restructuring of the company in the near term seems inevitable and will=
=20
produce returns for existing bond holders if they bought at low enough pric=
es=20
and if their debt is secured by APP assets outside Indonesia
o A restructuring will release some of APP=01,s assets, which are considere=
d=20
attractive except for those in Indonesia. APP is the world=01,s low cost=20
producer of pulp and paper, with substantial assets in Indonesia, China, an=
d=20
India. Its Chinese factories are attractive despite current over-capacity i=
n=20
the domestic Chinese market. APP accounts for 20 percent of the Chinese=20
market for printing and fine paper.=20
o Some play is available from price volatility as APP continues to tease=20
investors by keeping them guessing about its actual cash situation

Subject: EOL Average Deal Count as of 11-29-00


Changes to the Report Starting this Week:

-  The Gas Daily East and the East Graphs have been combined to just East.

-   The ENA Canada East and Central Graphs have been combined to just Central.

-   The NG Price Book is now named Financial Desk and shows values with and 
without exchange traded future transactions.


Notes for this Week's Report:

*   North American Gas has increased its overall average daily EOL deal count 
by over 1,000 trades a day since October.  There are now approximately 3,100 
trades a day in North American Gas alone which are being traded on EOL.

*  The newly combined East Region in North American Gas has approximately 
doubled its average daily EOL deal count and average daily EOL volume since 
October.

*  The newly combined Central Region in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 38% since October, from 498 to 685 deals 
per day.   However, the average daily EOL volume has remained steady since 
October.

*  The newly named Financial Desk in North American Gas has increased its 
average daily EOL deal count about 41% since October, from 494 to 698 deals 
per day.  In addition, the average daily EOL volume has increased about 25% 
since October.

*  California Power has increased its average daily EOL deal count by over 
32% since October.  The average daily EOL volume for California Power has 
more than doubled since October.

*  Midwest Power has increased its average daily EOL volume by about 75% 
since October.  However, the average daily EOL deal count for Midwest Power 
has remained steady since October.

*  Southeast Power has decreased its average daily EOL deal count by over 51% 
since October.  The average daily EOL volume for Southeast Power has 
decreased significantly as well.  However, these are approximately the levels 
we had seen in prior months before October. 

*  UK Power has more than doubled its average daily EOL deal count since 
October from 8 deals to over 15 deals.  The average daily EOL volume has  
remained fairly level.

*  Nordic Power has increased its average daily EOL deal count about 45% 
since October, from 20 to 29 deals per day.  In addition, the average daily 
EOL volume has increased about 25% since October.

*  US Weather has steadily decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a 
high in June of 241 deals to recent low of only 25 deals.  However, there has 
been a slight increase in November to 31 EOL US Weather deals with one more 
day to go..  

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen by approximately 85% since 
October, from a daily average of 150 to a daily average of 280 for November.

*  Coal trades have decreased significantly from the levels seen in October.  
The total monthly EOL deal count for November stands now at only about 21% of 
the total in October with only one more day to go.

This is another reason why the HR and A/A program don't like each other.  
It's absurd that our personnell functions don't share resources.  I'm almost 
of the opinion that these two groups should be folded together.

Kate Wagner (Thunderbird) was supposed to have been taken off this list

The list was also supposed to have been updated 2 months ago to reflect that 
Neville Ravji, Tiffany Wright, and Ben Creighton have left the company.
Betsy Bassis and Steve Pirozzi are physically located in London.

Are you sure you're pulling from the most up-to-date list?

Here is the latest version of the presentation to banks.  I have incorporated 
the comments I have received so far (although I have deleted a bit on the 
shipping slide on the EGM portion because it was duplicative).  Because this 
needs to be printed/bound by early tomorrow morning, I would ask that all 
changes to this presentation be given to me by no later than 3:30 london 
time.  

The final presentation will have background graphics but i have removed them 
for now to enable easier emailing.

Thank you.

Subject: Wells Fargo visit to Houston

Jeff K.,

Just a follow up to our prior conversations.

Representatives from Wells Fargo will be visiting Enron on Tuesday, January 
9, 2001.

As initially discussed, Wells is looking to learn more about Enron's overall 
risk management/trading capabilities and to explore potential areas of 
co-operation -- "areas where the two organisations may benefit from working 
together". Wells is incredibly interested in the breadth of markets that 
Enron is currently involved in. My sense is that, with a mandate to grow 
their capital market reach, Wells will be looking to us as a potential 
strategic partner in taking many of our capabilities to their immense 
corporate client base.

Based on my relationship with them, they have expressed special interest in 
EnronCredit. The form of this seems quite interesting. My sense is that they 
have explored building their own credit derivative capabilities and for 
various reasons feel that it may be more efficient/economical to build some 
sort of shared capabilities with our group -- I think that our focus on 
solutions for the corporate risk manager is attractive to them. In addition 
to this, their Chief Credit Officer will be joining on this date to explore 
our capabilities in assisting with management of the Bank's credit portfolio. 
Based on my discussions with them and my sense of their interest in exploring 
various types of working relationships with us, I would suggest that we have 
a senior presence at this meeting.

This being said, they also have a great deal of interest in speaking to the 
Heads of all our other risk management/commodity desks. My hope is that Jeff 
Shankman will be available to discuss/introduce Enron Global Markets which 
would then be followed with product presentations from all desks interested 
(Mark Tawney has already agreed to presenting our Weather Derivative 
capabilities). Also, our Global Finance Group has expressed their interest in 
participating during these discussions.

 It has been indicated to me that the following people will be attending from 
Wells Fargo:
Treasurer
Chief Credit Officer
Sr. VP, & Head of Product Development, Capital Markets
Head of Derivative Sales

My hope is to finalise an agenda by the end of the week. In order to 
accomplish this, I would like to discuss (as a group) the best format in 
which to present -- one which will ensure an accurate representation of our 
capabilities and of our interest in developing this relationship.

Thanks,
George

Subject: Selldown of Metgas

The partial sale of Enron India's 100% interest in Metgas is on Cliff 
Baxter's list of corporate assets for sale.  As I expressed in our recent 
telephone conversation,  I view Metgas as a key asset that could be of great 
value to the EGM LNG network.  I believe that Enron should reconsider whether 
or not a Metgas selldown is a wise move at this time for the following 
reasons:  

1.  The Dabhol LNG terminal is ideally located for future LNG arbitrage 
plays, i.e., halfway between middle east and far east LNG suppliers.  
Opportunites for Mideast/Far East swaps or shipping backhauls could generate 
significant value for EGM.

2.  Metgas currently holds exclusive rights to use Dabhol's LNG terminal for 
imports of LNG into India, and it will be at least several years (if ever) 
before a second LNG terminal is built in India.  We should not be giving this 
strategic position away.

3.  The fact that our competitors (e.g., Petronas, BP, BG etc.) want to buy 
in is an indicator that we have something of value.  Even a partial selldown 
(and granting of voting rights) to one of these players could serously 
compromise our optionality and ability to maximize value to Enron. 

4. I suspect that the market value of Metgas at this time (given that there 
is still significant developement risk) is fairly small relative to its 
network value to EGM.


If, in spite of my arguments, a decison is made to sell down Metgas, there 
are two things that we could do to limit the damage:

1.  Prior to the sale, sign an agreement between EGM and Metgas that provides 
EGM with exclusive rights to use the terminal, and

2.  EGM should step into the Metgas/Malaysia LNG contract (i.e., EGM should 
buy from Malaysia and resell to Metgas) to ensure that we maintain maximum 
optionality in this contract.  We could do this in a way that gives us 
control of the contract but passes Metgas risk through EGM and back to 
Malaysia.

I understand that the time fuse for this selldown is very short---immediate 
action is needed if you want a vote on this.

Rick

Dear Mr. Shankman,
? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron 
presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would 
enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television 
(similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around 
this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball  
rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea.
?
Sincerely,
Zachary Costello

I met with Carlo (as did several other Enron employees) last week and we are 
talking to them about a number of ideas.  One of which is detailed below 
(from them) and has technology and paper/lubmer points.  I believe Carlo from 
Dow will be calling you guys shortly.  Take a look at the attachment and 
you'll understand the points he's making that are relevant to your 
businesses.

Jeff, thanks for agreeing to make the introduction with Philip and Ray. I
have attached below a summary of Buildscape(Driving to Liquidity) as well a
high level PowerPoint presentation on Buildscape.

As you are aware, we have had introductory meetings with Rob Scheuer from
the Industrial markets, Brandon Wax, John Pavetto and Rahil Jafry. There is
interest in Buildscape from the group and Rahil has offered a sweat equity
option. Rob advised that he would come back to us in the shortly on his
thoughts around a strategic relationship.

We see the possibility of a broader strategic opportunity combining
technology functionality from the Networks Division, risk and credit
management tools available through your market making initiatives, as well
using the Buildscape providing an efficient channel to market for Enron
products and services in the Building industry and the home. In order for
this opportunity to receive senior management attention and to talk through
the possibilities, we will contact Philip Bibi and Ray Bowen shortly as per
your recommendation.

Could you confirm back that you have passed on the information so that we
don't surprise either of them on the topic and we will aim to arrange a
meeting with them in Houston in the next couple of weeks. We may call on
your help to sponsor the meeting if required.

In the meantime, we will press on with confirming the Dow/Enron April 27th
meeting in midland to pursue Chemicals and Plastics opportunities and we
would be very pleased if Mark Fievert can attend as well. If we need to move
the date slightly to accommodate Mark, then lets talk through the options.
Thanks.

At our LNG coordination meeting in London last Friday, I asked Doug Arnell to 
be the point person tocoordinate the assembly of a quick data base of all of 
our LNG sources and uses and ship availability over the next several years.  
He will work with Merritt Thomas, Brad Hitch and Eric Groves and will 
coordinate all of his work with Eric Gonzales.

The purpose of this exercise is to give us, in light of the fact that we do 
not have an operational LNG book,  a quick picture of the overall situation 
so that we can make some quick calls on Hoegh Galleon, Abu Dhabi etc.

I have noted that Doug has since started copying the two of you on lots of 
emails.  I will ask him to take the two of you out of the details on this for 
now so that we don't overload your email inboxes, unless you want to see all 
of the details.

I will screen the emails and forward you info to keep you in the loop but at 
a higher altitude without all of the gory details.

Please advise

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Jeff:
I believe you are aware the MetGas project has been suspended indefinitely, 
primarily due to the negative impact and uncertainty caused by the problems 
Dabhol Power is currently experiencing.  Enron  has suspended work to close 
project financing and we have significantly reduced the MetGas staff.  The 
Team will focus on completing the acquisition of all major permits and 
clearances over the next few weeks.  The go forward plan is to either package 
MetGas "as is" and sell it off or use it as leverage in the negotiation of 
the DPC workout with the Indian government.  

I will be relocating from India back to Houston  in the near future.  In 
anticipation of this relocation I am exploring possible job opportunities 
within the Enron family of companies.  

I believe I can add value to your team's efforts in developing the LNG 
projects in both Venezuela and the Bahamas.  I have experience related to 
both projects and I can hit the ground running.   In addition, I bring prior 
ECT experience and success as a deal maker / originator, extensive experience 
in LNG including the development of production facilities, regasification and 
related harbour facilities and experience negotiating LNG Sale & Purchase 
Agreements as both a buyer or seller. Coupled to this experience is my 
knowledge of what it takes to structure assets and the pertinent commercial 
documents such that the asset can be project financed.  I am confident I can 
be of help and add value to your Western hemisphere LNG Team.

I would appreciate you taking the time to review my resume and keeping me in 
mind when looking to fill any current or future positions. 


Thanks...

Larry Gagliardi has been with us for 6 months marketing EOL crude/products 
for 6 months and has signed up well over 50 customers according to Nowlan.  
He came from the crude and products broker TCT and knows the traders in the 
business.  He's our guy, and I want to expand his role in the group, as well.

Can you try to use your amazing persuasion skills on Mauricio - he has an 
Associate offer and came to sell weekend.  He's trying to decide between us 
and ABN Amro (also had a JP Morgan offer, but decided not to take it).  His 
concern is the $10k differential on our signing bonus and $20k differential 
in the guaranteed year end bonus because he wants to pay down his loans.  He 
wants to see if there is anything that we can do.  He feels like Enron is the 
better long term choice, but banking is a better short term choice.

Can you give him a call - 215.732.9989 (home) or 215.432.0183 (cell).

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Great job--Mike and I want to reiterate that this kind of business is 
absolutely core to our market, and this type of innovation leads to other 
businesses.  If you guys need anything, please get in touch.  Mike and I 
should be in London shortly, and are excited to learn more.

As info. 
 We are working to keep the bid / ask spreads as narrow as possible for each 
of our EOL markets - domestic and international coal, vessel freights and 
emissions.  Volumes for coal and emissions are already up, and freight should 
be a rapidly developing market.

Subject: Sea freight: 1st trade done today

hello John
we started to work on the idea of putting freight swaps on eol during fh may. 
we were ready technically early july, cleared all legal hurdles end july, 
went live on the 1st of august and did our first trade today . and guess what 
the customer is so enthusiastic that he ll make us great advertisement . this 
is the first time ever a shipping transaction has  been made principal to 
principal 100pct  through an electronic media.
fyg we are quoting 2 contracts based on cape size vessels (cargo size 150 000 
tons ) on coal routes . one is south africa to rotterdam and the other one is 
colombia to rotterdam. these routes are  the main routes of the international 
coal group portfolio. 
in terms of volume what we are putting on eol every day is more than what is 
contracted on the normal otc market on a monthly basis.
in terms of spreads existing otc market is working with 0.75 to 1 usd  when 
our spread is now 0.20 usd.

in september/october  we will increase the number of contracts available to 
include smaller vessels and other types transaction (time charter in addition 
to the present contract which are "voyage" type transactions) 
.

Fyi,

We have just traded our first sea freight contract today with Bocimar BV as 
the counterpart.  Bocimar is the biggest Cape size vessel operator in the 
world and they called after the trade to let me know that they think the 
system is great and will be using it to trade regularly.

Subject: how to go forward in the oil markets


CUSTOMER BUSINESS - EOL
Jeff - I think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the 
group are good starting points. I don't feel this will increase revenues for 
us in 2001 as our  efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin 
volume environment.  Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group 
trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a 
significant recruitment and training effort.   Both the recruitment and the 
teaching process are ones that we need to focus on.  Please let me know what 
you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I 
feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates.  I plan 
on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team 
that I'm assembling in London.   By end October, the London office will have 
5 managers, 4 associates and 1 analyst in our group.  This is a real shift 
from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors.   
Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside (about 33% 
success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron) I think this is 
the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look 
to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus 
toward teaching. My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL 
marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and 
analysis.  The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the 
consulting companies in London and I'm putting him in charge of drawing up a 
list of potential customers in every European country.  Please let me know if 
you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing 
business.  Can't help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic 
trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future.  Having 
seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume.  This 
is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our 
system.  The challenge is how can we put up more volumes, more markets, and 
tighter 2 ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run 
over.  What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to 
have.  I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct 2nd with Koch, 
Dynergy, Entergy, Willams, and a few others.  Are we thinking about trying to 
join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if 
we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have?   This is area that 
we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if 
we fail to be the largest in this platform.  I don't feel that in the oil 
business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site 
because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers.   We 
are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading 
companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the 
industry will look at two different e-trading sites.   

BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS 
This has always received luke-warm interest from Enron.  I believe that the 
inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on 
that
alone.   So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved 
in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical
business.  Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to 
increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest
financial commitment.  Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the 
corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor.  We 
can
candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are 
more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets.  We 
have
a credit department that have done a poor job, if any at all, in getting out 
there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to 
participate with
(petrobras, pertamina, petrolimex, sinochem, sinopec, egpc, nnpc) if we have 
any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes.   We are also 
the
worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we 
have a commitment to perform.  Our contracts are also drafted with many 
escape clauses that will be rejected by many end-users who will insist on a 
greater performance guarantee.  As we discussed briefly in Singapore, I think 
there are several airlines that we could target in the U.S. for physical 
supply.  I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential 
damages that the airlines have in their tenders.   Previously, I have not 
gone after this business because I didn't believe we would have the political 
clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such 
matters.  Please consider this (I will fax you a tender offer from Japan 
Airlines) and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are 
willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars.  That kind 
of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but 
it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline 
business.  


I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go 
forward....this message was more to highlight how I'm trying to advance the 
group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment.  Lastly, on 
that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems 
that will make us better suited to do customer business.  At the moment 
everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying 
to get toward a server based system
and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT 
people instead of traders.  I will let you know if we need any help from you 
on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT 
department.

Subject: Liquids VaR violation

Liquids VaR for effective date Dec. 06 is $8.5MM, a seven percent violation 
of its limit.  The cause of the violation was due to the following factors.
Company wide crude position got shorter 6.3MM barrels
Short NG from Jan-Feb-01 of 1.2 BCF.  (EOL trade placed in error, position 
Nowlan intended for was 10 contracts/month instead of 10 contract/day.)

With component VaR attached below, it is clear that crude product resulted 
the most VaR increase.  Keeping everything constant, if Nowlan gets out of 
his NG position, VaR would be $7.8MM.

Thor,

A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather 
business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while 
traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some 
feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank 
you for all your effort. 

 I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 
days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of 
our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to 
discuss some of the ideas you presented. 

Mike

Hey Jeff,

Sorry it took me so long to write.  I haven't actually
used my e-mail in about 2 months, but I'm trying to
turn over a new leaf.

Freak show, huh?  What's been going on?

Happy Belated Birthday.  Again, I'm so sorry I didn't
call you on the day.  I'm quite scattered now with
being a Mom and working 3 days a week.

Maddie is doing great.  She's 8 and 1/2 months now,
crawling up a storm, pulling herself up, drinking from
a straw, waving goodbye, and even dancing.  She's
still a pain in the ass at night however, waking up
2-4 times.  UUUGH!

I'd love to talk to you.  Here's my info AGAIN!

Love you, Nicole

Subject: Garcia Munte / Spain


The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks
Michel

Jeff,

I don't know if I'm going to get to meet Andrew, but he looks good on paper.  
My only question is whether we need another person working on LNG in Dubai.  
Obviously, I don't know quite what structure you want to put in place, and 
perhaps there are some projects I'm not aware of, but from what I've seen I 
would be worried that this guy would get bored. 

Just a thought, but looking at this guy's resume he'd be an ideal guy to work 
with Jonathan Whitehead and Joe Hirl in Tokyo.  He speaks fluent Japanese, 
knows the Japanese market, has contacts at Mitsubishi, and knows the LNG 
world.  Quite frankly, he might do more good for Enron's LNG effort working 
for Enron Japan than for LNG.

Also, regarding Elba Island, do you think you'd be ready for a conference 
call on Monday?

Thanks,
Brad

Notes for this Week's Report:

* The average daily number of Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen 
eleven-fold since September, from a daily average of 11 to an average-to-date 
for October of 121 trades per day. This upward trend has also been increasing 
significantly as Enron Metals has averaged better nearly 212 transactions per 
day on EOL for the last three trading days (16th, 17th and 18th of October).

* Average daily volumes for Austrian Power have dropped off considerably 
since September due to the inclusion last month of several very large OTC 
physical transactions, including a forward done with Slovenske Elektrarne 
A.S. which alone accounted for over 1,890,000 MWH.

* The average daily deal count and volumes for Swiss Power have returned to 
the levels seen prior to August.  Both the months of August and September 
included several very large OTC physical transactions which have not been 
seen so far this month.

* Average daily volumes for ENA - Canada East Gas have increased considerably 
since September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical 
transactions, including a forward done with the Westcourt Group, Inc. which 
alone accounted for over 33,167,715 MMBtu's.  At the same time, the average 
daily  deal count has decreased slightly.

* Average daily volumes for Central Gas have decreased considerably since 
September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical transactions, 
including three spot transactions done with the Trailblazer Pipeline Company 
and J. M. Huber Corporation.  Each of the three transactions alone accounted 
for over 140,630,000 MMBtu's.

Subject: Int'l Coal & Freight - Stats for Dec '00


A brief summary of stats from the month of December.  Volumes were off a bit 
from November, reflective of the seriousness with which members of the 
coal/shipping community take the holiday season - however, exponential growth 
from summer period continues.  This has exacerbated systems and back office 
problems we have been having for the past year, thus internal focus during Q1 
will be on this issue.

any thoughts on why the funds have their smallest nat gas positions on in 
over a year?
margins too high, don't like the risk/reward, i guess are the two most 
obvious thoughts but
perhaps you have something more insightful.  I thought the momentum funds
would be longer at least in some of the deferred contracts.

Hi everyone,

We've just returned from a vacation to the Pacific
Northwest.  Some of you know because we visited you
there.  This is a picture of us at Crater Lake in
southern Oregon.  The trip was simultaneously
wonderful and sad.  We saw the greatest people and
most breathtaking scenery on our way to the funeral of
our friend Richard, a beautiful person who died after
a long battle with cancer.  I'm wearing his red sox
cap in the picture which has been returned to the city
from which it came.

Last week Maddie had her first birthday which was
attended by many family and friends.  Keep checking
the photo gallery for pictures from this event as well
as halloween trick-or-treating once we get the film
developed.  The web site is as follows:

http://www.ophoto.com/I.jsp?m=8098111503&n=1447007383

We've put up a few more vacation pictures as well.

Hope this finds you all well and enjoying life and
each other.

Love Adam, Nic and Maddie

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 41/2000




Highlight
The freight market keeps inching upwards, with a consensus that the freight 
market will have some upward momentum until early next year, when it is 
expected that the steel makers will significantly reduce their raw material 
imports and reduce their freight requirements.  We are still trying to 
conclude our two structured deals with Coeclerici, but have run into problems 
as counterpart is not keen on agreeing our credit terms.  We are meeting with 
Coeclerici during Coaltrans to try and sort out a compromise and will also 
try to get our credit department to be more flexible with our terms as we 
need to adapt our terms to the shipping industry or face the possibility that 
no one will want to transact on our strict terms.  

This week the liquids group launched their tanker route on EOL and asked Andy 
( our EOL freight trader ) to manage it full time.  Within the first two 
days, 400,000 tons had been traded.

We have tendered for a contract covering two years to ship iron ore from 
Basil to Saudi Arabia starting in Jan next year for the account of Hadeed.  
If we were to win the contract, it would fit very well with our short 
position out of Richards Bay as it would allow us to fix a vessel on time 
charter from Europe to Brasil, then go to Saudi arabia to discharge and then 
continue onto Richards bay to load coal.  The net result of having the hadeed 
contract would be to save 15 days ballast sailing which in terms of dollars 
would equate to $250.000 saving per trip 


Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Up	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Up	Down	Down
Cape Size	Up	Up	Flat


Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed a panamax for early November loading from Puerto bolivar to Immingham


Third parties freight deals
Fixed a cape for late november loading out of RBCT to Rotterdam at $11.17 for 
Preag.


OTC 
FFA s
Bought a Us gulf/Japan contract for November from Conagra and a 4 TC contract 
from Andre for Q4 & Q1 01.  Our view is that the panamax market will rise in 
the short term and we are therefore going long with the intention of selling 
our lenght in a couple weeks and then build a significant panamax short 
position for next year when we expect a massive correction.
      
EOL
Traded 75,000 tons with Bocimar

Travels
Pierre, andy and myself are in Madrid until Wednseday meeting with several 
key customers

You are correct, JBLOCK got longer 495K barrels.  However, crude is a huge=

hedge component on this deal and net crude position for Liquids is short.
As you can see on the Component VaR graph, with the short position in crude=

Subject: pnl overnight loss of 6.7 mil for european distillates


some of this number is just due to the ipe gasoil mkt closing before the 
brent.

I will highlight what is coming back in and where the money is lost by doing 
an appx m-t-m where the mkt is at this moment.

ipegasoil  +1.4
physical gasoil      .90
heat      -.20
brent      -.30
dubai     - .50
pnl clawback      +1.3

we have been reducing the risk in the book on a daily basis as you can tell 
from the var changes.  I need to go thru
with the person who does our book in houston how he arrived at last night 
numbers.  the losses on physical gasoil
seem to great to me so hopefully the money coming back in will be greater 
than my above estimate.

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 


A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior. 

Regards for the New Year

Jeff:

Attached you will find three files:

1) The brief description of the Envera deal you requested. ("deal summary 
final")
2) A diagram showing one potential view of how the e-Marketplace for 
Chemicals will look and where Enron would fit in. ("deal summary e-commerce 
marketplace")
3) A slide from Envera displaying their connectivity concept.  Enron will 
participate as a Member, a Service Provider and an Owner. ("basic envera 
concept")

Deals obviously are never done till they're done, but this one is 95+ % 
there.  We've received Envera Board Approval and signatures from 1/3 of the 
Owners' granting consent to issue equity to Enron.


Thanks to both you and John for your support.  We could not have come this 
far without it.





Doug

As we continue with the India LNG issues, and grow the fundamentals research 
capabilities, I need a "map of the world" showing all LNG producers, and the 
specs of the product they produce, and all of the receiving terminals (demand 
side) in the world that match up with those specs of the producers.  (In a 
nutshell, what can go where)  Can I get this ASAP?  

Thanks

Dear Jeff,

I am working with our chairs, Claudia Lummis and Isabel Lummis, on our annual 
Gala.  I have been holding the following solicitation letters
until I spoke to you regarding the ask.  Karen Soh asked me to wait until the 
New Year.

Jack Cogen, NATSOURCE, $10,000 in 2000
Jeff Hawn, McKinsey & Co., $5,000 in 2000
Rocky Emery, Paine Webber, Inc., $5,000 in 2000

Please let me know how to proceed this year.  Are these contacts still good 
and how can we best approach them this year.  If you have other ideas about 
potential donors, please let me know.
Thank you very much for assistance.  I look forward to hearing from you very 
soon.

Sincerely,

Rick,

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for 
banks
(you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan
to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.

Vince

Simon Rich of Louis Dreyfus is on the board of TMG and his company owns 10% 
of the stock.  Does Louis Dreyfus still trade petroleum products?  We're just 
curious if he might try to kill a deal with a preceived competitor.

The Weather Risk Management Group will transfer Catherine Woolgar from the 
Oslo office to the Houston office as soon as she is able to transition out of 
her responsibilities in Olso.  In Houston, Catherine will assist in trading 
the US portfolio and be responsible for a number of EOL cities.  Catherine 
has developed a very good understanding of trading weather risk management 
products and the peculiarities of the weather market.

Ross McIntyre in the London Office will continue to provide general support 
to the Oslo office while developing relationships with the commodity desks in 
London and with the market generally.  Additionally, Ross will continue to 
assist in the development of the trade and portfolio analytical systems to be 
utilized globally by the weather desks.

In oder to significantly grow the weather risk management business, we are 
committed to the vision of trading and orginating locally while managing 
globally.  Accordingly, the Weather Risk Management Group ultimately expects 
to have weather trading in most Enron's offices that trade other commodities.

Dear Jeff,

Sorry I had to get  off the phone so abruptly.

I am glad to hear that you are still interested in the Butterfield for
Enron. It would be an amazing piece for the collection and a unique early
piece for $200,000.00 seems much more appealing than a recent bronze
multiple for $225,000.00. This is an amazing piece though I am afraid that
the email image is probably not very good.

The following are the details:
ARTIST: Deborah Butterfield
TITLE: Goldie
DATE: 1980
MEDIUM: wood, iron, steel, plastic, wire, etc.
SIZE: 77" x 101" x 41" (life size)

Just so you know, the Butterfield is in a crate in SF.


Yours truly,
Michael Rosenfeld

Hi Jeff-
Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm
still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the
Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second
finance class.

I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing
primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING
INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with
corporate securities).

Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global
Markets?  Sorry for the short notice, but I just won the course permit
tonight!

Thanks,
Matthew

Good Morning,
Thank you very much for your reply on my questions regarding the rest of the 
winter season in Europe, 
it is very useful information for us to get a commentary from professionals.

It would be good to get such an extensive report from time to time, or 
whenever a major change in the weather pattern take place.
On a day to day basis, is it possible to get a short comment on your opinions 
on the weather situation in Europe.

Thank you in advance.

Subject: Europe Winter Weather

Frank,

Here is an outline of what Mike, Jose and I put together today concerning the 
remainder of the winter across Europe:




The Bottom Line:

Much of the continent should feature temperatures, on average, cooler than 
the past few months.  Overall temperatures should be normal to below normal 
in the February and March timeframe.  An active sub-tropical jetstream will 
continue to provide a wet pattern near the Mediterranean keeping temperatures 
on the below side of normal.  Western Europe will also see the best chances 
for colder weather intrusions as the NAO trends positive.  Even with this 
cooler trend across Europe, there are no signs that the Arctic Pool of air in 
Siberia will move westward toward eastern Europe.  Overall no extreme 
deviations from normal are expected, only a slight trend toward cooler than 
normal.

Let me Know if there is more we can do:
Steve

Without knowing what subcommittees you are going to set up for the exec. 
committee members, I'll take the Analyst/Associate program.  We've been 
incredibly successful with Wharton/Penn , and I'd like to replicate our 
approach company wide.  I'm convinced with my help, we can do a world class 
job.  I'd be happy to give my thoughts on off cycle hiring, and other ways to 
improve the entire process (internal and external) around Enron.  

Thanks.   

Jeff

McQuade/NA/Enron@Enron 
Subject: EnronOnline

Jeff,
The main problem that our customers are identifying is that the products are 
randomly put on EnronOnline.  Unfortunately, this pushes our customers to 
other systems that are consistently showing numbers (such as Altrade's 
Chalkboard).  Here are some comments that Jennifer McQuade and Beth Cowan 
have received over the past two weeks:

NGL products (Jennifer McQuade):
Products that come on and off-line throughout the day (or sometimes are never 
put out all day): Natural Gasoline (physical only), Normal Butane, Purity 
Ethane and Physical Conway Propane (Craig Story).  These products are less 
liquid and the traders (Wade Hicks- physical, Adam Gross-financial) find it 
difficult  to keep the products out all day.  However, Chalkboard (which has 
the LPG on-line market share) consistently has 4-5 postings in each of these 
products.  Companies that have commented on this include Dynegy, Gulfsream 
Trading, Huntsman Petrochemicals, and Taylor Gas Liquids.
Lately, when one of the traders is out of the office, his products are not 
being posted (i.e. 12/14 Wade Hicks was out of the office and there were no 
physical Mt. Belvieu products).   
The product details say these market are open from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm, but 
the products often don't come on until 8/8:30 and are often gone shortly 
after 2:00 pm.

Crude/Products (Beth Cowan):
Beth spoke with Kirk Kinnear at Hess Energy Trading Company LLC (2nd largest 
crude counterparty).  Kirk commented that we are posting various products but 
the hours that they trade are not consistent - he compares EOL to other 
exchanges where the numbers are up all day long.  J
John Brewer at Occidental Energy Marketing said, "we are interested mostly in 
the PT market & West Texas but weren't seeing many quotes out there so I quit 
looking at it."
US WTI Cal swap - should be online until 3:30 central - Rob Fuller

Given year end issues, we really need to be trading close to the vest now.  I 
was a little surprised how big the prompt few months position in crude was 
two days ago, and we need to scale them back.  

I need the component var for those four structural trades we have today.  
thanks.... Jeff

Jeff

Need your input on LNG, particularly email below and requests by VV Rao for 
people in this office to be involved in LNG discussions.
Steve Lowe claims the LNG group have booked $5MM off the back off NWS 4th 
Train.  Steve claims he was instrumental in "introducing"  Enron LNG people 
to the NWS consortium and to BHP wrt the Japan regas proposal.
Would appreciate clarification on operation of the group.

Hi Steve:  It was a pleasure to meet you again in Sydney.  You live in a 
wonderful city. 

The meeting with NWS is now confirmed for Thursday, Jan 11th in Dubai.  I 
will be arriving with my colleague Satish Venkataraman on the morning of the 
10th so we can have a day of preparation.  I suggest you plan on joining us 
so we're all on the same page.  You'll need a visa which takes about 4 days 
to process so I think you need to start on it right away.  My assistant 
Dorice Cheong can help you with this.  Her number is (65) 838 9010.  

I'll call you later this week to discuss the meeting further.

Thanks, vvr

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

 When I was in your office you rattled me a quite a bit when you said you 
weren't ready to ask me a certain question.  I know that you and I have not 
had the chance to really talk lately and I've actually been in and out of the 
office in the late afternoons trying to get some health issues resolved.  I 
want to let you know I'm trying very hard to focus and work with Niamh in 
London, learn as much about reisd, and trade into what we think are solid 
positions.  So far I feel like its been going better than I even expected, 
but I know I have a lot more to learn.  I'm enjoying this product and working 
in EGM.  I'm trying to manage this Penn thing on the side and still help out 
Jenn and Fundamentals when they need it.  I'm begining to see what it means 
to be streched thin, something I'm sure you experience quite often.  I do 
want you to feel like you can ask me anything.  I'm here to express my ideas 
to you or if you feel like I'm not working hard enough, I'd like to know.  
I've really appreciated everything you've done.

With regards to the situation in Iraq, we have close contacts with Bayoil, 
who is the largest lifter to the US. They remain very bearish the market 
,though they are sold out on their november arrivals they have a lot of 
barrels available in december. They feel the Euro situation will be of small 
impact and they are seeing business as usual for november loading. As a side 
note they are normally right about the Iraqi situation but last year they did 
have vessels waiting at Mina al Bakr when the Iraqis cancelled loadings. I'll 
let you know if they change their tune.

I believe Greg W. is coming to talk to you today about this new business.  
Further to this, I'd like to ask again how I can get access to VAR  (I 
believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and 
allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily).  Is this a Board 
question, or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me?  

On another note, I've been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues.  
If you too need my help, let me know.

Thanks for your help...

Subject: 24-7 crude Book

Per conversation with Greg this morning, until we get board approval for new 
book with VAR have agreed to use discretionary VAR as required to negate VAR 
effects within global products. Position P/L will have to be reported within 
Global Products but we will pull it out as a separate line item at the bottom 
of the report. Positions at this time are not an issue but should it  become 
a concern between now and approval of a new book we will need to address it 
as we are the VAR with discretionary limits.

Jeff,
As you suggested last week, I am letting you know that I have yet to hear
from Jeff about setting something up.  I did manage to speak with Michelle
about what she is doing and I was exited about what she had to say.  let me
know how proactive I should be about getting in touch with Jeff.  Hope you
are well.

Attached are the weekly IB reports.  Since I'm in London there will be no 
hard copies this week and hopefully it will be up on the EGM Website this 
afternoon.  If you'd like copies of the full reports themselves, please just 
email me and I'll figure out a way to get them to you.  Everyone have a great

You have been nominated to participate in a video which will be shown during 
the Houston analyst meeting. The objective of the video is to demonstrate the 
depth, diversity and transferability of Enron people. The video will be shown 
early in the day's presentations and will also help set up the theme for the 
day which is Execute and Extend.

I am attaching a briefing note which outlines the questions that we would 
like you to answer on video. In addition I would be grateful if you could 
supply me with a map of your career - ie a list of all the business units and 
associated groups in which you have held positions at  Enron.   

Laura Valencia  - Houston ( Ext 3-6785)  or Fiona Grant - London (Ext 5308)  
will be calling you to  schedule a specific date and time for the shoot.

Many thanks for your help with this video.
If you have any questions please call me on 3-4785.

Thanks for participating in the first Traders' Roundtable.  If you have not 
read "When Genius Failed" by Roger Lowenstein about the rise and fall of Long 
Term Capital, I have copies--swing by and Jennifer will get you one.  It is a 
great read.  

You will get a memo this week about the next meeting.  

Jeff

P.S.  Phillip, no bid for the PAllen house.

CERA Alert: December 15, 2000 

Title: Refined Products Line--North American Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

US Margin Highlights 
* Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels, 
US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by $2.26 per barrel 
to average $1.45 per barrel during November. Gasoline margins have returned 
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at 
exceptionally high values. CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average 
$2.75 per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year, $1.16 per barrel 
lower than this year's first quarter average. 

* High sulfur No. 2 fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly, 
averaging $5.97 per barrel in November. Despite the drop of $0.37 per barrel 
from October's average, fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented 
values-$4.20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $3.46 per barrel greater 
that the previous five-year average. For the first quarter of 2001, CERA 
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record 
high level of $4.75 per barrel in the first quarter.

* Jet/kerosene differentials versus WTI rose $0.63 per barrel from the 
October average, reaching a whopping $8.59 per barrel in November. In 
correspondence with the distillate market, jet/kerosene margins are at 
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight 
fundamentals. CERA expects jet/kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the 
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the 
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of 
$5.75 per barrel.

* Margins for US Gulf Coast 1% sulfur residual fuel dropped by $2.15 per 
barrel, reaching $3.99 per barrel below WTI during November. Despite the 
recent widening of differentials, CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to 
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter 
months. Residual fuel differentials are expected to average $2.50 per barrel 
below WTI during the first quarter of next year, at the high end of the 
historical range.

US Demand Highlights 
* Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0.5 million 
barrels per day (mbd) from the October level, reaching 8.36 mbd for the four 
weeks ending December 8. Demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last 
year largely because Y2K concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago. 
CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder 
temperatures arrive, averaging 8.08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001.

* Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3.94 
mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, over 7 percent greater than this 
time last year. This represents a slight increase of about 0.05 million 
barrels (mb) from the end-October level of 3.90 mb, but still a record high 
level for early December. With support from low home heating oil inventories, 
particularly in the Northeast, distillate demand has been very strong during 
the fall of 2000. CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter 
months, averaging 3.79 mb during the first quarter of next year. 

* Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the October level 
to reach 1.68 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite the decline, 
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year-ago level. The 
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel 
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to 
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals. CERA expects the 
demand for jet fuel to average 1.81 mb during the fourth quarter. 

* Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0.87 mbd for the four weeks 
ending December 8, a decline of about 0.09 mbd from the October average and a 
slight increase over the November level. Demand for residual fuel is 
currently 11 percent greater than last year, and surging natural gas prices 
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout 
the winter. Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0.85 to 0.9 mbd 
range during the first quarter of 2001.

US Inventory Highlights 
* Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196.5 mb, increasing 
almost 10 mb from the end-October value. Responding to rising stock levels 
and declining apparent demand, forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 
23.5 days for the four weeks ending December 8. Forward supply is 2.5 percent 
below last year's level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the 
past eight years-although CERA still believes coverage is currently 
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter. However, CERA is 
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and 
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the 
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year.

* Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of 
October at 29.2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. 
Despite record high apparent demand, strong refinery production levels helped 
boost primary distillate inventories slightly, to 115.3 mb for this period. 
Primary stocks are 16 percent below last year's level at this time and at 
their lowest historical level ever. Although stocks are low, CERA does not 
anticipate shortages to occur this winter. Assuming normally cold weather, 
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting 
demand requirements-albeit at a high price. 

* Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage, to 
reach 25.7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. This 
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23.5 to 25 days' supply range that it had 
been in for the past four months. The rise of just under 1 day in forward 
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand. Jet inventories 
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull 
from tight distillate markets strengthen, but supplies are expected to be 
adequate for the winter.

* Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply 
from October, reaching 41.7 days of forward supply during the four weeks 
ending December 8. The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a 
drop in demand and an increase in stocks. With demand expected to strengthen 
because of colder weather and high gas prices, CERA looks for inventories and 
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks.

I just spoke with Matt Commons, and he is going to join enron, but didn't 
know of the additional sign on  (5k to 10k).  Also, he will be joining our 
finance area as his first rotation.  Thanks.  Jeff

The V@R violation memo should state that the reason we had a violation was 
the additional trading positions relating to the EOL 24 hr. trading 
activity.  There is currently a memo requesting an additional $2mm of V@R on 
Greg Whalley's desk.  This addtional V@R will be temporary until there are 
Board approved limits for these trading positions.

I know you guys have been working to secure supply for the H. Galleon.  I 
wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing, allowing us 
whatever freedom we want with the ship.  I'm not sure we should kill 
ourselves for a few pennies--I'd even let the ship stay empty and maybe force 
some of our will on the LNG market if possible, in effect creating more of a 
spot market.  Maybe EOL.   Any thoughts?

Jeff

Subject: Offshore crude

Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in 
the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling 
projects. This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure 
long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas 
trading desk activities. Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP 
program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than 
natural gas projects. 

They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which 
involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 
and #582. The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million 
barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd 
starting in 1Q 2003. Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 
API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur. Plans are to build a private pipeline to 
Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore. Peggy is 
finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.

Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude 
on either a fixed or floating basis. The floating could be tied to a Platt's 
index or the NYMEX. It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a 
physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last 
look from Murphy when the time is right. Another alternative is to give 
Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for 
the new production barrels. 

Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis 
differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003?

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 


A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior.

Jeff,

Our inventory (physical position) is aprox 494,000 credits long which at 
roughly $125/credit value for the strip (2000-2010) would have an asset value 
of $62 million.  Give me a call for an explanation of our position report 
below.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Dear Naomi,

Thanks for the opportunity to work with you on my new home.  I've enclosed a 
virtual tour disk (just follow the prompts), and some floor plans from my 
architect.  If there is anything else you need, please call anytime.  I'm 
excited for you to see the house in person, and have the chance to discover 
my passion for 20th century design.  Dennis and Daniel have been a great 
source of the best objects and knowledge.  Of course it is a primary concern 
to make sure the home, the objects, the furnishings, and the space work 
together.

Dennis and Daniel speak very highly of you and it is important to me that I 
have the help to complete this project with great attention, and all that 
results from that attention.

Best Regards,



Jeff

Subject: SADAF

You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how 
the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us.

Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF.  
We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within 
two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be 
forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA 
negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is 
signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.

We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, 
and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed 
with or without this specific turbine.  

Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.  
However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a 
bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.

If Delaney has a firm "bird in the hand" he should take the turbine.  
Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want 
to take the turbine.

My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.

Rick

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 


A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior. 

Regards for the New Year

John:
 I want to bring a matter to your attention. Last week I went to see Canadian 
Steamship Lines. Prior to my visit I asked Vikas, the middle marketing 
associate, to contact Singapore and get quarterly offers for IFO 180. Vikas 
emailed Hans Wong three times.  He also called twice. I also asked  Sarah 
Mulholland to call Singapore on Friday prior to start of my meeting. She 
could not reach Hans either in the office or on his cell phone. We finally 
received some numbers Monday morning, obviously too late for our client 
meeting.

I understand that you have been working very hard to increase responsiveness 
and market development for crude and products.  With this in mind, I  believe 
have a partial solution  that will prove beneficial to all. On the EGM 
fundamentals page I intend to include a section where the mids of all 
products will be posted based on the day's close. I think this would help 
everyone stay on top of the various markets and products around the world.

Thanks for your attention to this matter.


Jen

2000




CERA Alert: December 15, 2000 

Title: Refined Products Line--European Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

Rotterdam Differentials 
* The fall in product prices that started in late October-after a brief surge 
during heightened market tensions over Middle East unrest-continued in 
November. Average differentials for all products over crude fell, with those 
for gasoline falling particularly strongly in line with very weak reported 
demand. FOB ARA barges for premium unleaded gasoline over Dated Brent 
averaged $1.51 per barrel, compared with $5.86 per barrel in October.

* Jet/kerosene barge premiums over Dated Brent slipped by over $2.00 per 
barrel in November from October's average, but because of current market 
sentiment favoring prompt production of heating oil, they remained high at an 
average of $10.98 per barrel. Jet values had enjoyed the largest increase of 
all products during October's Middle East-related price increases; 
consequently jet/kerosene's premium over heating oil narrowed in November 
following an easing of tensions, averaging the month at $2.53 per barrel, 
compared with $3.29 per barrel over heating oil in October. 

* Despite falling by $1.33 per barrel from October's level, average 0.2% 
sulfur gasoil barge values remained very strong in November, averaging $8.45 
per barrel over Dated Brent. High end-user prices for heating oil remain a 
strong deterrent to demand, however; provisional data for German heating oil 
demand in November show a fall of over 10 percent from November 1999 levels 
(to an average of 608,000 barrels per day [bd]).

* Discounts of low sulfur (1.0%) heavy fuel oil to Dated Brent widened again 
in November, averaging $6.74 per barrel. As was discussed last month, much of 
the reason for their improvement in October was because of concerns over the 
availability in Russian exports: toward the end of October and into November, 
however, such concerns subsided, leading to a widening of discounts. High 
sulfur (3.5%) fuel oil discounts widened by $3.26 per barrel to an average of 
$9.61 per barrel to Dated Brent.

Refinery Margins 
* Margins fell back considerably after the very high levels recorded in 
October, but still remained quite strong and reflect the current market 
sentiment of favoring maximum refinery production, especially of middle 
distillates. High jet/kerosene and gasoil/heating oil values kept margins 
buoyant, but falling gasoline premiums and widening heavy fuel oil discounts 
were the major downward influences. 

* Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross margins for 
simple/hydroskimming refineries in the ARA region fell by $2.80 per barrel 
over Dated Brent from October's level, averaging $1.19 per barrel in 
November. The deterioration in heavy fuel oil discounts accounted for half of 
the decline, with the large drop in gasoline values contributing $0.87 per 
barrel to the fall.

* The drop in gasoline premiums was the principal reason for the fall in ARA 
complex/cracking refineries. Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross 
margins averaged $3.30 per barrel in November; this is $2.93 per barrel lower 
than October's average, of which $1.74 is attributable to the poorer gasoline 
premiums, with the remainder of the difference attributable equally to the 
declines in middle distillates and residual fuel oil values. 

European Inventories and Refinery Operations* 

* EU and Norwegian refinery crude intakes rose by a further 168,000 bd in 
November, averaging 12.6 million barrels per day (mbd), again an indication 
of refiners seeking to maximizing runs given the current favorable margins. 
Output data for individual products are not yet available, but the high crude 
runs and middle distillate margins would indicate that November was another 
month of very high jet/kerosene and gasoil production.

* Despite the strong crude runs, primary EU plus Norway crude oil inventories 
did increase in November, ending the month 9 million barrels higher than 
October's level (which was revised downward) at 426.5 million barrels. There 
has been a small but consistent three-month contango in the Brent futures 
market, placing a small premium on forward months' values of crude to the 
current month's, which would help to encourage stockholding. These stocks 
represent about 31 days' forward supply of anticipated total demand in the 
first quarter of next year-less than 2 days' fewer supply compared with 
November levels for the past two years. 

* Primary gasoline inventories fell in November from 154 million barrels to 
150 million barrels, contrary to typical seasonal patterns. This may reflect 
the relatively low levels of gasoline production over the past few months, 
and certainly current gasoline differentials to crude are not encouraging 
high gasoline production levels. Nevertheless, this is a potential cause for 
concern as it may lead to significant market volatility during the first 
quarter of next year. 

* Primary middle distillate inventories, however, are continuing to improve. 
October's total was revised upward slightly to 333 million barrels, and 
November ended at 334 million barrels. In addition to record levels of 
refinery production, exports from Russia are proving to be plentiful, with 
November's total exports from the former Soviet Union averaging 460,000 bd. A 
strong transatlantic arbitrage, however, has been causing most of these 
cargoes to go direct to the United States rather than stay in Europe.

Jeff,

Thanks for inviting me to be in the Round Table.  I think it'll be a 
success.  I'm able to make it to dinner tomorrow night for the Tiger Team 
deal.

Fletch

p.s.  did you close on your house yet?

Mr. Shankman,

I hope all is well with you. Currently I am a second year analyst faced with 
the dilemma of which career path to pursue.  Although there are several 
options, I'm primarily interested in developing a deeper understanding of 
Enron's market philosophy. Trading, risk management, and commodity 
structuring all sound interesting to me at this point, but I want to go into 
my next rotation with a clear sense of direction.

Brad Hitch, who I worked with over at Enron International, suggested I 
contact you to discuss your needs as well as new developments in your group.  
He thought you would be in an excellent position to assist me with my 
decision.

My resume' is attached for your consideration. As you will see, I have a 
significant amount of Investment Banking, and financial industry experience. 
I know how busy you must be during this time of year, but I would appreciate 
a few minutes of your time.

I shall call you during the week of November 14th to schedule a time for us 
to meet. In the meantime, if you need to contact me, my number is 
713-853-6818. Please leave a message if I'm not in, and I'll return your call 
the next day.

I look forward to  speaking with you.

Sincerely,

Damon Harvey

What is the opportunity to look at Elba Island space in conjunction with the 
Dhabol supply contract?  That is, could we go to our LNG suppliers for India, 
and regotiate that contract and provide space for diverted cargoes if 
necessary.  Jim Hughes is spending his time figuring out what to do with 
Dhabol and any suggestions we have may be helpful.  

Thanks.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 44/2000




Highlight

The cape market is starting to show signs of weakening in the spot market as 
the Panamax market is trading at a discount to most major cape routes and 
charterers have started to split cape stems into two panamax stems.  As for 
next year, the cape market is still trading at robust numbers but the 
sentiment on the panamax market has definitely turned bearish as the massive 
new order of vessels and the lack of grain cargoes from the US is front page 
news everywhere.  We are now starting to see big grain houses really starting 
to sell the panamax freight market for next year.  We are also having several 
large owners calling us directly over the last few days to try to convince us 
to take their tonnage for next year or fix COA's.  We are short approximatly 
45 pananamx cargoes world wide next year.

The long term Coeclerici deal was finally concluded this week and booked for 
$1.3 Million.  We have another smaller deal with Coeclerici which we will put 
into the books within next week and are looking currently at repeating the 
same strategy on a smaller panamax vessel to be delivered in 2003/2004 with a 
purchase option included in the deal.  
Last week we added to our short panamax position for next year by agreeing to 
sell an additional 6 panamax cargoes to National Power ( now called Innogy 
).  In total we now have sold 12 panamax cargoes to Innogy from RBCT to the 
UK for 2001.  Further, we are in discussion with Intercore to sell them an 
additional 3 capes for Q4 2001 from Puerto Bolivar to Rotterdam ( we have 
already sold them 4 capes for next year ) and also discussing selling 3 capes 
or 6 panamax cargoes ( our option ) to Glencore for Q1 01 from RBCT to the UK.

On the EOL front, last week was an active week as we traded with EDF trading 
a total of 375,000 tons of sea freight and then on Friday, just before going 
home, Louis Dreyfus transacted 5 times on our new grain panamax route ( U.S 
Gulf/Japan ) for a total of 270,000 tons.

Jeff/ John--I left a voice message  with you re: the attached.

BICC ( formerly known as General Cable)  is one of  EES's key national 
accounts. They have expressed interest  in whether  Enron might help them 
manage the  volumetric/price risk associated with  the below commodities. 
They have provided us this information  on a confidential basis. Are these 
volumes of interest to you? With whom might we work on your staff?

Thanks for  your help,

If you've had a corp fin class about int rates, bonds, etc, I'd take the 
Funding Investments class.  
Have a great weekend.

Hi Jeff-
Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm
still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the
Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second
finance class.

I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing
primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING
INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with
corporate securities).

Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global
Markets?  Sorry for the short notice, but I just won the course permit
tonight!

Thanks,
Matthew

I'm looking forward to our drinks/dinner of woes.  (But not too long on woes, 
I don't like not being in a good mood).  When is good for you week after next?

Jeff

P.S.  I really don't like that expression "misery loves company"  by the 
way......

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

My view on the discussions with Southern Co. is that it is one of several 
potential ways to get at some upside out of our rights at Elba Island.  It's 
also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from 
LNG coming in to Elba.  Nothing will be committed to without considering all 
the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.  The 
discussions are still, in my view, exploratory.

Thanks

Hi guys,

Shawn Cumberlan, the former head of the CALME region, is very interested in 
learning about the transportation businesses we are pursuing.  He will be in 
London end of next week or so and I'd like you guys to spend some time with 
him.  

Dan, expect a call from him before he heads to London.  Mark Frevert is 
having him explore opportunities within the wholesale businesses.

Later,

Jeff

Guys

There has been tremendous interest expressed already by generators, 
developers, and utilities to just about every coal producer about locating 
plants at mines. Some are moving forward. The most advanced appear to be 
Peabody (into TVA in western KY) EnviroPower (permitting three sites in Ky 
and Indiana) and Anker (permitting a site in W.Va). All sites are near 
transmission.

We can help locating sites , reserves and producers near transmission if we 
knew where the power needs are.

Attached is a new paper by James T. "Jim" Jensen of Jensen Associates,
Inc., entitled "Oil-to-Gas Price Competition - Can it Place a Cap on Gas
Prices?".  The paper is very thoughtful and timely.  Because of the
immediacy of the issue, we have elected to distribute this article by
e-mail and to post it on the USAEE website (www.usaee.org) rather than wait
to publish it in the next issue of "Dialogue".

We are grateful to Jim for providing this excellent article.  If you have
questions for Jim, he can be reached by e-mail at JAI-Energy@att.net.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 08/2001




Highlight
Despite sharp movement in spot rates for both sectors week in general has 
been relatively quiet. Capes saw majority of strength in Pacific with Intra 
Pacific rates rising around $1800 since last week. Late surge in Japanese 
buying ahead of the close of their financial year is main reason attributed 
to this rise. Atlantic Capesize been pretty flat to marginally better, no 
exciting news. Outlook for coming week is that Far East strength will be 
maintained although pace definitely slowing. No change sentiment in Pacific.

Panamax has seen opposite effect, grain stems finally rolling from S America 
which has been the major driver of the Atlantic market, for March loaders. 
market was under impression that Pacific likely to come under downward 
pressure but once the demand has been strong enough epecially for modern 
tonnage and outlook for coming week is that reates are likely to maintain 
firmness. Atlantic expected continue run for next week.

Short term we have established small long for nearby Capes, but maintain 
overall perspective to sell forward curve on appreciable rallies. Panamax 
very similar approach.

Panamax we fixed timecharter tonnage to cover 14 / 26 Mch Dreyfus Ist 
nomination USG / Far East grain cargo. Have also taken option to extend 
period of vessel for short Trans-Pacific voyage if market maintains strength 
longer than we think.

Below are the primary DCF assumptions:

1.  WACC = 11%

2.  EBIT from existing business was calculated as an average of 1999 and 2000 
with certain adjustments.  Growth rate is 4% per annum.

3.  Financial trading earnings estimates as per John Nowlan are as follows 
(urea and ammonia only):  
Yr 1 - $0.5MM
Yr 2 - $2.5MM
Yr 3 - $5.0MM
Yr 4 - $7.8MM
Yr 5 and future - $10.3MM per year

4.  Origination earnings estimates as per John Nowlan are as follows (all 
products):
Yr 1 - $5MM
Yr 2 - $10MM
Yr 3 - $20MM
Yr 4 - $25MM
Yr 5 - $30MM
Future - $5MM incremental earnings every year

5.  Working capital requirements continue to grow at the same pace (ie. no 
efficiency in working capital assumed).

6.  $2MM of capex every three years for capital improvements (in addition to 
annual maintenance items that are expensed on the Income Statement.)

First--Ted your voicemail isn't working.

I would like to get active in recruiting products traders, in a real attempt 
to high grade the group.  Can we, and how do we make a full court press with 
the headhunters out there?  Also, what do you guys think of putting a big ad 
in the Chronicle, and the WSJ?  We could also look for originators and 
marketers.  

Thanks.  Jeff

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff

Hi All:

Here's a picture of Quinn Isabel Costello, born on Sunday January 28th in Sao
Paulo, Brasil and weighing in at 3.1 kg (@6.5 lbs) and 50 cm (@19.5 inches).

All three of us will be in the US for a visit sometime this summer (as soon
as Quinn gets her US and Brasilian passorts :), and we hope to see many of
you then.

In the meantime, please e-mail us with news about all of you in the outside
adult world -- we probably won't be getting out much for a couple of weeks...
(*Please e-mail stefanie at her new address above.)

Tchau,

Stefanie and Michael

CERA Knowledge Area: World Oil 

In the past two weeks, oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength 
that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages 
this winter. The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard 
to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil 
stock situation is at least stabilizing, even if stocks have not built 
substantially, and that, thus far, despite a few weeks of colder-than-normal 
temperatures, heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key 
US market. That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving 
speculative interest into the market. Furthermore, the potential for weakness 
in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001. 

The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that 
Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide, yet, the Iraqi export 
cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals. If the cutoff lasts 
through December, the effect will be pronounced-it would turn a projected 
fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) into a 
stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic 
because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions, and 
exports may again cease. At some point such a development would have a price 
supportive effect. 

CERA's price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch 
released in late November. Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or 
repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production, the projected average for first 
quarter 2001 is $29 per barrel for WTI. However, this outlook is based on 
OPEC's announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its 
production by the start of the second quarter. A failure to restrain output 
would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $27 WTI for the first 
quarter of 2001, with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in 
the first. The downward pressure results from the prospect of a 
larger-than-usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 
3.0 mbd-with a cut in OPEC output.

Iraq in a Twilight Zone 
As anticipated, Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UN-controlled "oil for 
food" program as of December 1 in protest over the rejection by the Security 
Council's sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule.*

Iraq's pricing was judged by the UN overseers, who monitor the export program 
and advise the sanctions committee, to be about 60 cents per barrel below 
comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that 
Iraq was seeking from buyers.

Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues, Iraq partially 
resumed exporting on December 13. Since then, about 1 mbd has been exported 
from the Mina al-Bakr terminal in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the shutdown, 
Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of 2.21 mbd for November, as 
compared with 2.08 mbd for the third quarter. Exports for November were about 
1.3 mbd from Mina al-Bakr and about 0.9 mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. 
Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed, owing to the surcharge dispute, with 
the result that about 1.2 mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market.

Iraq's semi-shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its 
dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues. (In the midst of 
this dispute, the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oil-for-food 
program at the last minute on December 5; it became effective on December 6 
and has been accepted by Iraq). As of December19, Iraq's revised export price 
for Ceyhan, proposed for the remainder of December, has again been judged too 
low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions 
committee. Additionally, the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude 
that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow 
account would be a violation of UN sanctions. Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina 
al-Bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a 
surcharge to Iraq.

How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear, but it continues 
to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an 
apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are 
the heart of the sanctions system. The distinction that Iraq has made between 
Mina al-Bakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina al-Bakr by 
loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company. Iraq may have judged this 
accommodation to be in its interest, since it recently also signed an oil 
exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil. As 
currently structured, the deal would violate UN sanctions, but India is 
seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic 
hardship. The exception seems unlikely to be granted, which may lead Iraq to 
cease exports from Mina al-Bakr again.

There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow, but we expect 
uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as 
leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security 
Council to end all restraints. Consequently, the Iraq factor will remain an 
element in the oil price outlook. 

Iraq's antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq 
issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take 
office. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a 
need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to "reenergize" 
sanctions. The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign 
policy-oriented think tank in Washington. A consensus seems to be emerging 
around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by 
retaining UN control over Iraq's oil revenue and strictly enforcing a 
prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general 
trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international 
irritant. There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to 
destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that 
the prospects for success are remote.

Demand Trends 
Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for 
gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so, 
and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas. Interruptible gas 
customers with resid or distillate fuel back-up have already switched to oil, 
so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the 
already high level of distillate demand. So far in December US distillate 
demand is running at a record high December level of 3.9 mbd. However, only a 
small portion of this demand is the result of economically based 
fuel-switching from gas to distillate. CERA estimates that the additional 
demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is 
relatively small, on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mbd. In CERA's view it is likely 
that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short 
notice because in some cases, this theoretically switchable capacity has not 
been used in recent years, and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in 
uncertain condition. 

Switching by interruptible gas customers (such as utilities) to distillate 
began about a month or more ago, although the volumes involved are relatively 
small. Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices 
started to surge in the summer. A portion of the US secondary and tertiary 
distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible 
gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage. Given the 
expectations of a tight gas market, regulators have been explicit about 
enforcing back-up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the 
current heating season. 

Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching. 
Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost 
of feedstock natural gas is high. Natural gas is also used in some enhanced 
oil recovery operations, and some of these producers have also opted to sell 
gas back to the grid rather than produce oil. 

Supply Trends 
Non-OPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0.9 mbd over a 
year earlier at 46.4 mbd. Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican 
production, curtailed in October by about 300,000 bd owing to the effects of 
Hurricane Keith. Mexico's fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 
3.64 mbd-about 95 percent of Mexican liquids capacity. Norway's output 
increased 200,000 bd from October to November as maintenance season ended. 
Norway's production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.53 mbd.*

Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a 
recent surge in exports, in spite of higher export taxes. Russian exports of 
domestic oil production (excluding transit volumes) reached 2.5 mbd in 
November, after remaining fairly steady at about 2.35 mbd from July though 
October. Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2.5 mbd, 0.3 mbd 
greater than in the fourth quarter 1999.

CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged 2.91 mbd in November-down 0.1 
mbd from the October level. The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced 
Iraqi output for the first 12 days of December to roughly 0.8 mbd. Iraq 
resumed exports of about 1 mbd on December 13, which raised production to 
1.80 mbd. Assuming no change in Iraq's current production stance, Iraqi 
production would average 1.41 mbd for December. On a quarterly basis, the 
decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth 
quarter of 29.0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0.5 
mbd into a stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. These production estimates include 0.15 mbd 
of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November 20 without UN 
authorization and are continuing.

Oil Stocks 
US crude oil inventories (DOE data) have climbed intermittently from an 
annual low of 280 million barrels in September and reached 292 million 
barrels in mid-December (see Figure 1). Since prices weakened in late 
November, crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September 
and the ranges seen in October to levels from 289-292 million barrels.

Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below year-earlier levels; 
at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels, or 24 percent less, than 
those of a year ago, but there are indications of builds in secondary and 
tertiary inventories. We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 
5-10 million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at 
the end of last year.

In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with 
those of the United States. In November stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels 
to 426 million barrels. At this level they are below the highs of 1999 but 
well above the low levels of early 1996 (see Figure 2). Japanese crude oil 
inventories at end-October were 107.6 million barrels, which is above the 
record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent 
years (see Figure 3).

Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the 
gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as 
commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a 
commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though 
this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been 
taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over 
her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in 
the hiring decision.

Shall i do brad's termination, or will you.

Subject: LNG brochure revised draft

As you know, we are preparing a new LNG brochure that will be rolled out at 
the Gastech Conference in Houston mid November.  Many of you have submitted 
comments that are hopefullyincluded herein.  Attached is the latest draft of 
the brochure text.  Please review this very carefully and submit your 
comments to Henry Means/Zdenek Gerych by Tuesday noon.  

I have scanned this and have noted at least several typos and some 
numerical/statistical errors.  AG, please check in particular the DPC/Metgas 
stuff.

Henry/Z, the purpose of this brochure is to communicate that the market is 
changing and that Enron is leading the transformation of this industry.  
However, there is a negative tone in parts of this that is a slap in the face 
to the major oil companies and the government companies particularly in the 
Mid east and Far East.  I want to get all negatives out---anything that a 
supplier could read as an insult will come back to bite us.  The message 
should be bold but positive, with no implied insults.

I look forward to reading the next draft Tuesday evening

As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to 
be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates.  As you know, Enron has 
committed over $1million during the next four years to University of 
Pennsylvania, and Wharton..  I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in 
getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number 
of summer employees.  I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for 
the summer.  In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.  I am 
operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have 
positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.  I will not accept the 
notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.

In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift 
certificates is viewed as good one.  I'm not sure that is a good use of 
Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for 
the sell weekends.

Jeff

Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there 
were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial 
team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar 
recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 
contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless 
weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we 
are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting 
function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, 
given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, 
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be 
accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in 
their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all 
responsibility going forward. 

I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.

Jeff

Jeff, we talked last week about Ozzie Pagan coming to the FPL meeting.  My 
thoughts are that the deals Ozzie are talking about it are great and could 
very well be a part of what we do with the LNG deal, but I doubt the meeting 
will get to that level of detail.  If we get the LNG deal and a possible gas 
transaction on to FPL's radar screen, then we will have accomplished alot.  
Having Ozzie there as Enron's Florida power project developer may be too 
distracting.  As part of the many follow-up  meetings we will hope to have 
with FPL, Ozzie can make his pitch to them.

If you concur, I'll let Ozzie know.

Thanks

As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best 
way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this 
business unit.  This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position 
management from a worldwide perspective.  Our ability to gather data and to 
show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success.  As 
important is one pricing desk.  Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is 
running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type 
business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group.  

To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I 
wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention.  ALL LNG 
contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, 
etc.), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our 
commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker.  

It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion.  We 
all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) 
could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our 
businesses.

Regards

Jeff

Subject: ARA Coal Mkt Summary

MKT SUMMARY

Despite the fact that we have seen some cargoes offered for resale in ARA mkt 
for nearby delivery thru to Q1 this week the tone of the mkt 
remains very firm. EDFT, seemingly still unsure of it's burn schedule one 
week to the next had a spot cape to find a home for if he could replace 
with tonnage from either ourselves or the mkt for December delivery. We 
offered equivalent of $39 cif ARA but they chose to take her themselves 
and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability 
to extract from the mkt anything better than $40.50-$41 cif for delivery
December period. Indeed, due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some 
South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which we
showed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at $40.75 on a cif 
basis. Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continues
to reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts - there is 
no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers 
look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices. Many were already well 
sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill old
European contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets. Certain 
South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year and
Drummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on 
track stating that it won't be until May next year that they are fully 
back on track again. While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to 
the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the 
spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets. Q1 01 
still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side 
we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is 
also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied. Still
could see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q1 
01 at $41.50 fob and Jan/Dec 01 at $41.25 - watch this space.

SPOT TRADES     

While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various 
channels it has been a week without any spot business. As per
above the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the 
buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirements
rather than pay these high prices in advance. We are also not too aggressive 
at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arriving
later in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome 
returns as we move further into the winter months and those spot
buyers are eventually forced to the table.

SELLING SIDE

Mission still have not covered their December requirements. Our offer of 1.46 
GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and 1.28 GBP FOR 
Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of 
1.30 delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material. We said that
he shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell 
that wud be very kind. The sage continues!
We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke 
Bremen for between 850mmt - 1mil tonnes per year
starting Jan 01. Prices will be linked to the BAW Index.
HEW/VW combined are tendering for 270,000mt for Q2 shipment into Hamburg. We 
have offered $42.50 cif.
Electrabel looking for 50mmt each month 2001. 
EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q1 01.
Veag - 300mmt cif Rostock for Nov00/Jun 01
Endesa - 4 capes for 2001.
H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working 
various possibilities of swapping material for 2001.
While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian 
coal going forward they are looking for us to sell them
some sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward!
Fenosa - 250mmt of Low Vol U.S material for 2001 but so far unable to get an 
offer basis this material.
Innogy looking for upto 1mil tonnes for delivery throughout 2001
Bewag still have tender out for 500mmt for next year where we are looking to 
put a proposal to them basis Polish material.


BUYING SIDE

Continue to work Emerald for material out of the U.S. - hopefully persistence 
will pay and we may close something this week for 2001 
shipments.
Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q1 shipment FOB Santa Marta at $32 
basis 11800btu/lb
Ensham had a lower quality coal (cape quantity) on offer at $25.30 fob Oz but 
unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospect
to find a home for.
Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q1 which would 
equate to somewhere in the region $41 cif ara. Would be good
to test viability of shipping thru this port.
In tandem with 5 year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a 
five year Agency Agreement with German counterparty
whereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen 
obligations.
NCSC - looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African 
material for 2001.


EOL

What started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week 
yet. Between Thursday and Friday we did 16 trades via
EOL equating to just over 300,000mt. Glencore was the main sponsor of the 
action on Friday, intent on driving prices higher they were
a net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a 
physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitments
with no coal assets as a backstop! Life to date we have traded 950,000mt on 
EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the 1mil 
mark this week. 
We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at 
Coaltrans in two weeks time.

GAMEPLAN

Running the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing 
tonnage to play with for next year. To date our Drummond long has
been the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply 
out of Puerto Drummond for the first 6 months of next year. With the
demand that we have on the table today we could turn our 1 mill long into a 
short with no problem at all.  While there will always be a level
where one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so 
at the traded levels for 01 today despite the absolute levels 
being the upper end of the historic range. We still have a little way to go 
to actually signing contracts which secures us the 5 year deal 
with stadtwerke Bremen but  on the assumption we do we must start looking at 
our supply strategy for the first 6 months of next year where
it looks to be most challenging. The business we will be fantastic for 
creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that we
can supply 10% of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the 
springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace.

Best Regards
Jez

Dear Jeff,

I left a message on your machine, but I just wanted to say again how much
your gift to The Temple means to me, personally. As the current President,
one of my big agendas is youth and camping and you have certainly given that
a major shot in the arm. We have a fabulous new Youth and Camp Committee
Chair in Chris Brice and I do hope that we can all get together when you are
here next week. Chris and I met for over an hour just last week to discuss a
plan of action to get more kids involved. I thought perhaps from your
history of youth group involvement you might be interested in reading my
first bulletin article, so I will copy and paste it to the bottom of this
email. My son was just elected Programming Vice President of our Youth Group
and he will go on the NFTY Exodus trip to Israel next summer. All 3 of my
boys are involved in UAHC camps. I believe that that is the single most
important thing you can do to instill a love of Judaism in kids today. Well,
don't get me started. You see, you have really hit my button on this.

Thank you for your kindness and your vision. May this New Year bring you all
things good..............

Warm personal regards,

Why do I want to be President?

It is indeed an honor and a pleasure to have become the 16th President of
Congregation Adath Israel Brith Sholom. Having already spent 6 years on the
Operating Committee, I've been preparing for a long time. It's very
interesting to me that as soon as it became apparent that I was in line for
this position, the same question kept coming up from many members, including
some of my closest friends. " Why do you want to be President of The
Temple?" was asked of me over and over again, especially during this last
year. It was always asked with kindness, but extreme curiosity, so I thought
that I would take the opportunity of my first bulletin article to give the
entire congregation my answer.

I grew up in New Orleans at Touro Synagogue and at 15 years old became very
involved in my Temple Youth Group (TYG). I was an active member of SoFTY
(Southern Federation of Temple Youth) and spent 2 summers at Kutz Camp
Institute ( the national Reform high school camp) in Warwick, New York. I
taught our Sunday School music and Israeli dance program and just generally
embraced the Reform Movement. I spent 5 summers on the staff of the Henry S.
Jacobs Camp Institute in Utica, Mississippi. (Sister camp to the Myron S.
Goldman Union Camp) Through all of this time, I made life long friends and
contacts that are now leaders in their Reform Congregations around this
country, as well as UAHC staff members. Growing up active in the Reform
Movement, embracing it as a teenager, with my parents' support, has modeled
my religious life and I guess that there was no other choice for me, but to
do this.

There are still other reasons for my taking on this responsibility. I've
heard so many times over this past year, "But what about your family? You'll
be so busy!" It all comes down to the old saying, "If not now, when?" and I
have to add, "If  not me, who?" If I, Julie Benson, don't take the
responsibility to help in a leadership capacity of my Temple, then who else
shall I count on? Can I ask others to do a job that I am not willing to do
myself?

My children are another reason why I do this. Perhaps, from my example, they
will someday feel a sense of obligation to their Jewish community. I would
like to think that one day my grandchildren will look upon my picture
hanging on the wall of The Temple and appreciate the position that I took to
keep their Temple thriving. It's a small, but important job in the scheme of
our Jewish world, and I feel very good knowing that I will do my part, to
the best of my ability and encourage others to do so as well.

The rewards are great. It's the least that I can do and I look forward to
much volunteer involvement over the next two years.

I now ask all of you to get involved on a committee here at Temple. The list
is in this bulletin. Call the chair of a committee that interests you and
say, "Count me in!" You'll soon see that rolling up your sleeves feels
really good. Together, as a community, we can accomplish great things. As a
congregation supporting each other, we will thrive. Let us share our
heritage in every way possible.  Through our combined efforts we will make
The Temple stronger  and in the process, I promise that we will also have
great fun! Thank you for your confidence and for allowing me this
opportunity to serve you, my Temple family.........

B'shalom,

Julie

We would like to thank you for your time yesterday allowing us to make you
aware of the Buildscape initiative and potential opportunities for Enron,
Dow and Buildscape to partner and develop the web based services for the
residential building industry in NA that would lead to a tremendous market
offering for the users/customers of the web solution as well as the market
access and services that could be made available through this new business
entity.

The potential synergy of the Buildscape market rollout and web based
technology platform with the Enron capabilities and market making
functionality and Dow's position in the Building industry as a major
manufacturer/supplier would be a powerful combination and I would like to
recommend a follow up meeting to discuss the options around strategic
investment interests and alliance after you have had a chance to regroup
after yesterday's meetings. The possibilities exist today for Enron to join
Dow as a major investor/partner in Buildscape.

Rob, you mentioned that you will be visiting the NAHB show this weekend. Dow
and Buildscape are also participating and our VP for Building Products
Business - John Schaw who was on the original conference call will be there
as well and we would like to arrange a meeting between John and yourself. I
will ask his assistant Marcy Putt to try to contact you and see whether a
meeting can be setup possibly for Saturday.

Jeff,  James Mason and I were also pleased to meet with you to discuss
global market opportunities on a broader sense between Enron and Dow and we
will follow with a meeting between yourself and Pedro Reinhard( CFO) in
Midland at the earliest convenience.

I have attached the Buildscape presentation from yesterday for your review
and follow up to complement the documents previously sent.

FYI

Today EnronCredit completed a deal for Cargill.  Cargill sold to us a 1yr 
Bankruptcy Swap on Farmland credit .
Two months ago, European Freight traders completed financial freight trades 
with grain cargos originating in 
the states for EU and Japanese destinations (Cargill, Dreyfus).  Over the 
past two months, MG Structured Finance 
(NY) has been working on an export finance deal with ConAgra for grains of 
South American origin (US destination 
presumably).  Continuing client discussions continue to surface more than a 
passing interest for weather products 
in the softs (and other agricultural markets from previous discussions).

Subject: marketing quote

i wanted to follow up on our earlier phone conversation regarding a marketing 
quote. i spoke with troy about the product he was looking for, a strip of 
flat price quotes for 7 months, and the reason for the time delay. in order 
to give an accurate fixed priced quote on a month by month basis i needed to 
update the merc quotes on each front to back for the 7 months. this was going 
to take approx 5 minutes, the time needed to get spreads from the floor, and 
this was the amt of time i told troy i needed. i also explained i could quote 
it as a strip package vs settle live.( i believe this all took place Friday.)

if memory serves me, early Monday the customer asked for the quote as a strip 
package. we quoted it live, but i don't believe they liked the offer. 
considering that i quoted the mkt on both the bid and ask, which was a good 
25-30pts tighter than the floor i am not sure what the problem was. as i see 
it, if they did not like the offer i provided they were free to take me out 
of the bid i showed them on the two way.

kind regards,

Phil Clifford

   Veteran Was Behind Wheel in Lake Crash

    A part from an airplane that crashed in the Great Salt Lake on Sunday.
                       (Danny La/ The Salt Lake Tribune)

    BY NESREEN KHASHAN
    THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE

        GREAT SALT LAKE -- Tooele Valley Airport weekend manager Gary Parks
    heard the steady buzz of the KingAir Beech overhead.
        It was 5:20 p.m. on Sunday when he recognized the unmistakable
    sound of the twin-engine aircraft flying over the Great Salt Lake,
    minutes before it spiraled into the icy waters below, killing all nine
    people on board.
        When the plane went down, snow was driving down hard, and there was
    about a quarter-mile visibility around Tooele Valley, Parks said. While
    he wondered if the plane might land at a different airport, having
    unshakable confidence in John Cashman, the plane's veteran pilot, he
    didn't think the worst.
        "No, I didn't have a bad feeling," Parks said. "He was the best,
    most competent pilot I'd ever seen in my life."
        Today, federal investigators, including an official from the
    National Transportation Safety Board, are expected to begin examining
    the conditions that led to the crash. A barge hauling a crane is
    scheduled to arrive around noon to recover the shattered remains of the
    plane, which rests in about 5 feet of water 11 miles west and one mile
    north of the Salt Lake Marina.
        Preliminary reports indicate that the plane was flying under visual
    flight regulations, or VFR, which require that minimum visibility and
    weather standards be met, said Federal Aviation Administration
    spokesman Michael Fergus from Seattle. But federal investigators said
    there are no indications yet whether adverse weather played a role in
    the crash. Investigators still don't know if the pilot used or switched
    to flight instruments to navigate, which are most commonly used to
    compensate for poor visibility.
        The plane carrying Cashman and eight skydivers was returning from a
    weekend of jumping in Mesquite, Nev. Two of the skydivers, husband and
    wife, were the owners of Skydive Salt Lake, a Tooele-based company.
    Keith Stewart, the company's only other full-time employee, said the
    plane was used to make up to 23 jumps in Nevada from Friday through
    Sunday.
        Parks said he attempted to make radio contact with the plane
    immediately after he heard its engines. Investigators said Cashman
    never signaled for help, and Parks' efforts to reach the pilot were
    fruitless, he said.
        About five minutes later, the husband of one of the plane's
    passengers arrived at the airport to pick up his wife. Parks said at
    around 3:15 p.m. the man's wife had called her husband to say she was
    boarding.
        The 35-year-old plane didn't have a registered flight plan with the
    FAA. That meant airport officials didn't know it was in the air when
    Parks began calling around to see if the plane had landed at an
    alternate location. So when airport officials began searching for the
    aircraft about two hours after it disappeared, they examined several
    hours of radar reports to determine the plane's location, said Tooele
    County sheriff's Deputy Lt. Frank Park.
        Search-and-rescue officials believe that the four women and five
    men died instantly as the plane hit the water, fragmenting into pieces.

        Flying in from the southwest, the plane was probably making a
    180-degree turn into the Tooele airport runway when it went down,
    airport officials say.
        The first body was found at 1:30 a.m. Monday by the shores of the
    marina. During the next several hours, all nine bodies were recovered.
    Seven of the bodies were also found on the shore.
        Through the rest of Monday morning, a crew of at least three dozen
    on three boats concentrated on recovering personal effects from the
    plane.
        Brian Hall, one of the rescue workers who scoured the waters with
    flashlights that pierced the darkness, said the hardest part was "not
    knowing what you were going to find until you got there."
        Recovery crews retrieved foam pads, helmets, parachutes and other
    skydiving equipment.
        Parks said he was struck more than once by the commonplace items --
    like a single shoe floating in the water -- that were meticulously
    plucked from the scene. Most backpacks, duffle bags and other luggage
    that were floating were still zipped shut, but Parks recalled one large
    blue suitcase that had burst open, scattering articles of clothing over
    the water.
        "I've been doing this for a lot of years and it never gets easy,"
    Parks commented. "Unfortunately, any time you're involved with any
    tragedy like this, there will always be reminders of its personal
    nature."
        Monday's crash comes exactly five years after a small plane crash
    in Idaho in which six Utah businessmen and two pilots were killed.

George, I just saw the updated 4Q earnings outlook, and saw Jupiter, and 
British energy off the sheet.  Is Jupiter off because of the Massey problems 
you mentioned today.  What about British energy....

Thanks for all your help with Sempra.  Hard work, but certainly worth it.  On 
another note, Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American 
Coal, and the interest rate hedge in the MPR.  Bottom line, we are not taking 
this hit.  It seems it was a problem with Treasury, so send it to them.  

Thanks. 

Jeff

The reason for the memo before was because the India guys still don't 
understand.  Hopefully this clears up their ideas about a separate marketing 
and trading shop in India.  

Have you had time to think about Russell Dyke?

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Hi Dave.  As a follow up to out conversation, I found out Robert Rauschenburg 
will be here April 5 or 6 and the weekend (April 7-8).  See how that looks on 
the calendar for y'all yankees to visit down here in rodeoland.  (I did go to 
the rodeo last night--hosted a big party--and wore my boots, and a cowboy hat 
my group gave me--pictures to follow)
Can you believe I went to the Rodeo?

Jeff,

The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was 
previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other 
engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.  

If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave 
Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys 
are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple 
of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley 
leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron 
Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of 
Izzo's guys).  

If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this 
is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.

Thanks
Eric

 Office of the Chairman
From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 19/10/2000 17:24 CDT
To: All Enron Worldwide
cc:  
Subject: Organizational Changes

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51/2000




Highlight

The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers ( 
Fuel Oil ) helping the slide as they have lost approx. $30 in the last couple 
weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less.  Panamaxes 
have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.  Most bundits think that 
this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.  The Japanese buyers and the 
US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks 
while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops 
while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news 
of resumed shipping.  When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, 
Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market 
quickly reversed trend and starting going up.  

With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow 
down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining 
positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.  Have a good holiday 
and see you next year !!!

fyi,

Hats off to Larry Gagliardi and the Unleaded desk. They have done another 
large crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 
2001. This trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second 
largest transaction conducted to date on EOL.

One of the tranport dot coms has asked if we could post diesel hedges on 
their site.  I know we don't (maybe no one does) trade diesel.  But there is 
a huge a need for this product in the transport world.  Any thoughts on how 
to do this?

Subject: MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE - You've Been Selected to Participate in an 
Interactive Panel

You have been selected to participate in an interactive panel at next week's 
Enron Management Conference.  The panel, which is scheduled to take place at 
10:30 a.m. on Friday, November 17, will be the last session of the conference 
and will last approximately an hour and fifteen minutes.

You don't have to do any significant preparation.  All I ask is that you 1.) 
review an article, 2.) give some thought to your experiences at Enron, and
3.) come willing to talk.  Peter Skarzynski, founder and CEO of Strategos, 
will moderate the panel.  With Gary Hamel as its chairman, Strategos is a 
leading innovation consulting company. Gary will be presenting at the 
conference on Thursday.  His presentation will revolve around his latest 
book, Leading the Revolution.  In it, Gary outlines ten rules for designing a 
culture that fosters innovation.  We will focus the panel discussion around 
seven of the ten rules:

Set Unreasonable Expectations
Stretch Your Business Definition
Design an Open Market for Ideas
Offer an Open Market for Capital
Open up the Market for Talent
Lower the Risks of Experimentation
Make Like a Cell - Divide and Divide

To familiarize yourself with these rules, I will be sending you a Fortune 
magazine article (June 12) that provides an overview.  (You'll notice that 
Enron is used as an example for several of the rules.)  During the course of 
discussion, you will be asked to talk about your own experiences with 
innovation within Enron.  In sharing examples of innovation, Peter will ask 
you to address the following questions:

How did you do it?  (Were one or more of the rules applied?)
What were the hurdles? 
Where did you stumble?
What, if anything, was surprising?

Outside of discussing specific examples of innovation, the discussion might 
also include conversation around how to maintain a focus on innovation while 
running the day to day business or how to spot a good idea.

You'll notice I referred to this as an interactive panel.  Another element to 
this panel will be audience participation.  At this year's conference, for 
the first time  we will be utilizing an electronic audience response system 
(ARS).  Through the ARS, presenters will be able to pose yes/no, true/false, 
or multiple choice questions to the audience.  During the course of the panel 
discussion, Peter will solicit feedback from the audience on certain topics.  
The audience will be able to respond to questions immediately by simply 
pressing a button on an electronic keypad.  Responses will be instantaneously 
recorded and graphically displayed on the screen.

I want your participation in this panel to be as easy and painless as 
possible.  I will not be scheduling any meetings to discuss this further.  I 
will merely ask that you forego the scheduled break at 10:15 a.m. on Friday, 
and come to the front of the meeting room to speak briefly with Peter and to 
be equipped with a microphone.  If you wish to speak with Peter prior to 
November 17, he has assured me that he will make himself available to talk 
with any of you.  I will be happy to arrange a call for you.

If you will not be at the conference and therefore not able to participate, 
please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can consider a 
replacement for you.  Feel free to contact me with any other additional 
questions or concerns.  

I'm looking forward to working with each of you on this endeavor,

Subject: LNG for Spain

Some follow up on friday's meeting:

We need to focus quickly on whether or not there is any deal to be done with 
Middle East suppliers that can contribute to Enron Europe's power project in 
Spain.

Our pending deal with Adgas to ship LNG on the Heogh Galleon could be a good 
fit however  the current volume being discussed (0.3 MMTA) is only a small 
portion of the 1.3 to 1.5 MMTA required for the project in years 03+ (minimum 
delivery would be 1.0 MMTA).  We should press ADGAS to see if they would 
commit to a higher volume.  We also need to determine what we believe is the 
most effective pricing structure for the ADGAS LNG purchase (both in terms of 
supply to our project in Spain, but also for potential diversions to Europe 
in 01/02) and for what term.  Based on our discussions on friday, it may be 
that a crude based purchase price may work the best.  We have discussed both 
Brent and NYMEX based pricing formulas with ADGAS.  Merritt, Eric, lets add 
that to the agenda for our monday morning meeting and get some price 
structuring done.

The structure of the ADGAS deal will be based on a U.S. delivery.  We will 
reserve the right to divert to any other market (except TEPCO).  We will 
likely have to share, in some way the shipping savings, if we divert to a 
non-U.S. terminal but I think we can keep any upside made on the indexed 
portion of the price for ourselves.

In addition we will be contacting OMAN LNG to determine their ability to 
provide quantities to augment the ADGAS supplies, as well as potential 
shipping options (Exmar?)  Obviously we need to consider shipping 
requirements for our Atlantic Basin projects (i.e. Elba Island) when thinking 
about shipping for Spain.  I would also like to look at how Elba could be 
used as part of a potential take or pay avoidance strategy for the Spain 
power plant.

I will try to keep everyone updated as the pieces come together.

Thanks

Jeff-
Pete Keavey asked me to send you my resume. I was working in Dutch Quigley's 
group for my first rotation. My second rotation was in the CALME Structuring 
Group. Since CALME is going through a reorganization, the analysts were told 
to find new rotations. I am currently interviewing with a few groups and I 
would like for you to take a look at my resume. Please contact me if you have 
any questions. Thank you for your time.

I think you know about this....  On another note, I have 5 cases of Kistler 
in my office--should we crack a few?

Doug - I was out on paternity leave and did not get this message until now.  
The DC lobbyist for NYMEX is Mark Seetin, however I think the problem is 
Rappaport himself (see e-mail to Capitol Hill below).  Call after you get a 
chance to review.

Subject:    [Fwd: NYMEX Strongly Opposes CEA Bill With Energy and Metals
Author: Mark Seetin <nymex2@unidial.com>
Date:       10/27/00 10:18 AM

I'm forwarding a communication sent at the direction of NYMEX regarding
the CEA legislation.  This truly is an unbelievable process.

Mark Seetin


NYMEX Chairman Dan Rappaport has asked me to convey, on behalf of the
Board of Directors, our strong opposition to the passage of H.R. 4541
with the current energy exemption provision.

This provision is anti-competitive, anti-consumer and is bad for the
marketplace.  If the proponents of this provision were truly in favor of
competition, at the very least, they would not have opposed extending
the same regulatory treatment to open outcry markets.  Their opposition
to such regulatory equity speaks volume about what may be the true
intent--use government and legislation in a perverse way to thwart
competition and allow them a government sanctioned license to hijack a
market, without even having to compete for it.

Please do not allow this bill to go forward without a closer examination
and discussion of this unwise provision.

If you have any questions, Chairman Rappaport may be reached at (212)
299-2250, My telephone number is (202) 662-8770.

Would you please update us on the status of your discussion on behalf of
Senator Gramm, and the overall status of the bill?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Mark Seetin

Chris,

I was in a meeting today with Jeff Shankman and he was interested in who in 
the NYMEX was behind their efforts in DC to cause EOL problems. I told him 
the Enron DC office was pleased with the initial federal government comments 
regarding protection for EOL from the NYMEX's stance. He still wanted to know 
who at the NYMEX was causing Enron grief. You may respond directly to him if 
you wish, but please let me know that you have responded to Jeff so I can 
consider my request closed. 

Thanks,
Doug

There ae meetings scheduled in Singapore starting early next week to disclose 
key information to potential buyers of Metgas, including BP and presumably 
other competitors.  Disclosures will include the terms of the Metgas Malaysia 
Sales contract and will quickly get into our concept for EGM to sign a master 
supply agreement with Metgas.

Have you talked with Baxter/Sanjay about this?  I still believe that selldown 
of Metgas is a mistake that will cost Enron dearly down the road.

Highlight

Cape market continues to fall but probably too fast and too early by most 
players  Asia will be back from holiday Monday and market is expecting rates 
to stabilise by end of next week.  We are currently evaluating taking another 
cape on short period or fixing a COA with a distressed owner for our Q2 
cargoes out of RBCT or Colombia or both.  The average earnings for a cape has 
fallen from a high of $25,000 in November to $18,500 today.  Pierre is in 
Japan next week and should get a good feel as to what the Japanese steel 
mills are up to and what kind of opportunities are out there for us to 
concentrate on.   

Panamaxes as anticipated are very difficult to read with close to zero Far 
East biz. Atlantic very short term has slight imbalance of tonnage but backed 
by very good USDA corn sales yesterday, the grain will start to role by end 
Feb. Paper rates have remained stagnant again lacking real physical input, 
nearbys marginally easier forwards flat neglected. Strategy will either be to 
bear spread where nearby premiums are good or bide our time and buy Q2 dips 
or calls.

The story out of Bocimar this week is that they view this year as being 
definitely weaker than last year and that they feel it should average around 
$15,000 to $17,000 for the year ( which is still a good market for shipping ) 
and at those levels, they are happy to sit back and watch.   Furthermore, 
last week CMB ( parent company of Bocimar ) released their earnings for cal 
00.  Their Dry bulk division made 60 million Euro and their tanker division 
made 60 million as well.  These are very good numbers for their dry bulk 
division taking into account the incredible rise in bunkers last year ( cost 
of fuelling the ships ) and the fact that their ships were often at anchor 
and not generating revenues.

On the funny side of things, Coeclerici is having their yearly audit by 
Arthur Anderson and AA has discovered that although Coeclerici makes money 
trading FFA's, they lack proper daily position reports and models to value 
options.  As a result, I got a call from Koert ( head shipping at Coaclerici 
) asking for our assistance as AA had mentioned to them that they should talk 
to us about our systems and procedures.  Being that Coeclerici is our biggest 
counterpart, we jumped on the opportunity to assist and Andy James is being 
sent to genoa Tuesday for a one day tutorial about risk controls and 
procedures while trying at the same time to better understand how Coeclerici 
values deals, which needless to say should help us in the future when 
negotiating with them.

SUMMARY

ATLANTIC

Mixed signals coming from the market at present with Billiton approaching us 
to buy FOB stem at RBCT for a cargo each Q2/Q3 and were active for the first 
time in a while in the SECA market buying up 2nd half 2001 material. 
Meanwhile there remains to be South African resell tonnage coming our way - 
predominantly appearing by way of the Spanish utilities who continue to have 
excellent hydro levels and ourability to source South African Call Options on 
FOB RBCT level with strike of $32.50 seems to question the recent information 
that Billitonsold tonnage at $33.25 equivalent into European consumers for 
the rest of the year Furthermore for the first time this year we begin to see 
Colombian resell material appearing on the market both on a CIF and FOB basis 
- probably no coincidence that this comes at a time when some of the steam 
seems to have come off the U.S. spot market. Overall the tone seems to be 
firmer but with very few new fundamental inputs to fuel this but rather 
producer sentiment  After weeks of tentatively drifting south the SECA market 
traded up a dollar along the whole curve last week. This was really a 
consequence of a few looking to buy into a market void of sellers which was 
itself is directly a function of peoples unwillingness to further sponsor a 
market which has come down some $5 from it's high's. The spot market is now 
trading at $40.50 Fob barge Rotterdam, 2nd half of the year at $40.25 and 
then 2002 at $39.50.

PACIFIC

Despite the extensive coverage which the Far East seems to be attracting with 
regards to economic slowdowns/weakness the Pacificmarket continues to be 
tight. The JSM/Producers continue their annual negotiations, but expect to 
see few conclusions from these in theshort term as the JSM's continue to 
exercise all the options they have to keep the drip feed going and most have 
clauses in their contractswhich allow them to carry on shipping material 
despite any agreement until September time. Both KEPCO and Lafarge have come 
out with tenders for the delivery of coal for prompt shipment - it is 
definitely a sign of progress that we are being invited to bid but without 
any length with which to play with, going short in front of Glencore and Rio 
could be expensive - the plan will be to participate without winning the 
business. The Chinese Annual Coal Fair took place over the last cuppla weeks 
where contracts for 2001 are negotiated and various sectors lobbyfor their 
allocation on infrastructure. The major takeaway's from the meeting were that 
total production is estimated at 950 million mt for 2001with exports targeted 
at 63 million mt - up 5 million mt from last year. Despite increased export 
targets, the sentiment remains bullish with most producers asking between $29 
and $31 representing a $3/$4 increase versus 2000 prices. Strong domestic 
prices will limit any downside in the export market and while the government 
is keen to keep pushing exports there is a general  scepticism over the 
ability of the rail to move the projected tonnage. We have signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with a producer based in Inner Mongolia (ZCIC)to 
market upto 1 million mt per year into the export market - all going well 
this will provide us with the necessary length to be able to target business 
in the region more aggressively.

GAMEPLAN

We continue to try and take advantage of this mismatch between the origin 
markets and the European market by selling out of origin lengthand using the 
resell market to pick up tonnage to service our commitments at destination. 
We are working several bits of long-term destinationbusiness in the Atlantic 
which if successful will serve as a melting pot for any length we have 
remaining in that basin and more. We will alsolook to sell into any further 
rally in the destination SECA mkt. Despite fundamentals in Asia pointing to a 
slowdown in demand the consolidation we are seeing in Australia will 
certainly prevent any collapse in prices and short-term expect prices to head 
higher than the $30 I wud call FOB Newcastle today. It will be very difficult 
for us to get any ammunition for the near-term but we are looking at various 
projects which will again give us access to coal further out in the curve and 
at the same time are exploring any opportunity to own some optionality to 
give us some protection against a continued squeeze further out in the curve.

Best Regards
Jez

Subject: Cement- a new business opportunity?

Jeff:

CALME's HR advised me that there is no match for my skills and experience in 
your business unit.  I spent a great part of my professional career in the 
oil & gas business.  Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can 
bring value to his team.  I have not gotten any response yet.

As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would 
like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for 
Enron:  Cement.  This industry can be transformed to the new economy and 
given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us 
and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline.

This is new for me but enormously challenging.  I am asking you to give me a 
chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.  I have enclosed a 
brief resume for your review.

I look forward to meeting with you.  Thanks, Jeff

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.


Jeff & Gary

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.

Jeff,
Great to meet you this morning.  I enjoyed learning about the directions
that you have Enron moving in and I look forward to continuing discussions
with you in the new year.  It was also nice to exchange notes with someone
who shares the collecting bug.

Have a good time out west and don't let Michael and Halley con you into more
cold weather fishing.

Thanks for breakfast,

Jana - Jennifer Fraser is in need of ten analysts to rotate into her group 
(Fundamentals which is a core training area) in EGM over the next few 
months.  Her greatest need is for two analysts, one in November and one in 
December with the remainder being spread out in early 2001.  Could you send

Mike and Jeff,

The following is an update we sent out to Harvard and Ospraie regarding the 
status of our transaction pipeline.  I thought it would be of interest to 
both of you as well.



Gentlemen,

We have sent the final version of the CA to Hallwood to be signed, hopefully 
we will receive information either tomorrow or early next week and have a 
preliminary valuation and structure proposal by the end of next week.   We 
are negotiating a CA with Nuevo and they appear anxious to get started.  
Their general counsel told me they have prepared a box of due diligence items 
to be delivered as soon as we agree on certain terms.  The DevX CA should be 
finalized today as well and we will get started on that prospect hopefully 
next week also.  We are still waiting on information from Chesapeake, but I 
spoke with Marc Rowland last week and he is getting his new reserve report 
finalized and will send it to us when it ready.  Benton is progressing albeit 
slowly because of the complicated nature of the structure.  We are also 
analyzing a new transaction that another group within Enron has originated 
and structured a VPP around but they may not have favorable financing.  It 
could represent an opportunity for both of you to see if a small equity 
participation in the SPV is of interest.  That's it, call me if you have any 
questions or comments.

Doug,

I just wanted to say that you handled Hallwood perfectly. Also if it is time
to move on other fronts -- Benton / Nuevo -- I am ready to go. I think Nuevo
will probably be under pressure in the next few weeks after missing 4q and
reducing reserves.

Subject: gmp update and mtm exposure

in addition to our unsecured debt and strategic stock risk we also have a mtm 
risk on the cargoes
that we have been importing under ectric. the arrangement was that we would 
import the cargoes 
(enron selling to ectric) and allow gmp to buy small volumes from us on an 
intank transfer basis.
this was working ok for the month of november but with their volumes falling 
dramatically in dec 
they have not been buying any material and in addition have given us a 
program for 3 dec cargoes
that at this stage they really didn't need.  that is not 100% correct because 
they did need these
volumes to meet their strategic stock requirements but clearly they are not 
going to be selling these
volumes for sometime if they cannot get some cash to  prepay for the oil.  
this mtm risk is conservatively
around 9 mil dollars.  this mtm risk reflects the fall off in flat price of 
oil over the month of december.  
this is somewhat of a hedge against gmp acknowledgement of the hedges that 
ectric was holding
against the strategic stocks but nonetheless we are in a situation where we 
should import no further
oil.  robert quick and myself are going to spain in the first week of january 
to clarify the veba oil pledges
and potential fraud.  we are getting several vsl on subs for lifting oil out 
of spain in 1h january to show
that unless gmp is seen putting money back into the business we will be 
removing our support from
them.  given the significant risks still present we can only hope that such 
actions on our behalf in ely
jan. will initiate a response from gmp management that hasn't happened 
previously.  i've enclosed
the spreadsheet that reflects the appx mtm risk on the oil ectric is holding 
in spain for the account of
gmp.  I don't believe we could have done this any other way or they would 
have folded already.
any hedging we did on their behalf would have added further to our risk (we 
already had the short
futures vs the strategic stocks) in an upmarket but cleary we need to 
consider this risk when we
evaluate how quickly we are prepared to take the actions that will close down 
gmp.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 07/2001




Highlight

The cape market is still rising, but very gently.  Owners are still quite 
concerned about the year as a whole and are actively seeking coverage.  We 
spend much of last week covering all our short positions thru to May.  Plan 
is to sit back for a couple weeks and then sell short again for Q2, Q3 and Q4 
if feasible.  

We struck a deal last Friday with Cetragpa ( Pierre's ex co. ) by which we 
agreed a collar on the RBCT/Rotterdam route for 2002/2003.  We bought a call 
at $7.80 and sold a put at $6.80 for 600,000 MT ( this could be valuable 
hedge for the first 2 years of the Gijon Business).

On the panamax front, Pacific market is still relatively active and strong 
while the Atlantic is soft with few grain cargoes from the US Gulf.  We fixed 
last week a contract to supply 3 panamax vessels of coal and Petcoke to 
Aceralia ( Spanish Steel Mill ).

We are also currently seeking freight for our first freight and coal business 
into the US east coast ( Thanks to the US coal guys ) on a Belted self 
discharge handy max to load in second half of this year.

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

Subject: Dabhol

Jeff/Mike,

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under 
the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no 
direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related 
supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is 
a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations 
and current discussions with the suppliers.

>From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule 
the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both 
suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron 
as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural 
start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 
2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is 
more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update 
on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to 
discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will  
be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone 
number is 505/336-8400.

Dear Jeff,

I am working with our chairs, Claudia Lummis and Isabel Lummis, on our annual 
Gala.  I have been holding the following solicitation letters
until I spoke to you regarding the ask.  Karen Soh asked me to wait until the 
New Year.

Jack Cogen, NATSOURCE, $10,000 in 2000
Jeff Hawn, McKinsey & Co., $5,000 in 2000
Rocky Emery, Paine Webber, Inc., $5,000 in 2000

Please let me know how to proceed this year.  Are these contacts still good 
and how can we best approach them this year.  If you have other ideas about 
potential donors, please let me know.

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

I think we will see many exchanges with weather contracts in Europe next 
year. I've heard about 6 different ones so far.  One of the problems we will 
run into is that they all look into different way of setting up contracts.  
That can create a situation where we don't get anyone to concentrate about 
any "standard" solution.  By cooperating with them can we probably control 
the development, but we can also try to keep them in the "dark" so we get 
people to use EOL more.  I would tend to lean to the last option right now, 
and see how it goes

Thanks for the update.  I think it shows how starved for new products these 
exchanges are.  I'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities.  
It's unclear what they bring, and how does this help us?  what do you think?

We have had some meetings with the Helsinki Stock Exchange, and they are very 
eager to link to us on Weather.
What's your general opinion about linking EOL to other Exchanges when it 
comes to Weather contracts?

Subject: Weather: meeting with HEX

Meeting with the Helsinki Stock Exchange (HEX) went well and the future 
opportunities for both parties were discussed. They were very eager to list 
HDD swaps (and options at the Exchange) and this should be done by this 
coming spring. 

Below some bullet points from the meeting:

"deadline is spring
Enron as one of the market makers
They would need our help in formulating the product descriptions for the 
local authorities in Finland
They are looking at listing a few points in Finland to start with and then 
maybe adding other Nordic / European points 
They will provide clearing services for the products 
They will also market the products and give training to institutions as well 
as private investors/hedgers


Next steps:

They will contact other players regarding the weather derivatives. However, 
it seems that they see us as "the one" in this market and therefore would 
like us to help them out in the beginning. 

They will get back to us during this month to give us an update and outline 
the future process in more detail.

How do you feel about this? Are we interested in becoming a market maker? 
I feel that it would a great opportunity for us i.e. increased liquidity and 
they would do most of the marketing and training. They are also in a co-op 
with Eurex, which could open more doors for us in the continental market.


--------------
They have also to some extent investigated the possibility to list Real 
Estate derivatives at the Exchange. The way to do this would be to construct 
an index based on the closed deals in the real estate market. There could be 
separate indeces for the different part of the country or just one common 
one. Is this something we could do as well?? It would be a good instrument 
for institutions with large real estate portfolios as well as private 
investors (those saving for a house or the ones owning real estate).

John

We are pleased to confirm today's launch of the following products via EOL:

Ethylene Contract (NW Europe)
Propylene Contract (NW Europe)
HD Polyethylene (German Film)
Polypropylene (German Inj)
Polystyrene (German General Purpose)

In a 2nd roll-out (timing TBC) we are looking to add:

PVC (German Pipe)
LD Polyethylene (German Film)
LLD Polyethylene (German C4)

We are initially offering 6 month and 12 month swaps for each product.

SUMMATION OF EUROPEAN MKT

- market is very conservative and tunnel-visioned, with derivatives as very 
new concept to all players (case of tail trying to wag the dog)

- even though no OTC trades have been done we are looking for the launch to 
act as a magnet for potential counterparties to at least start looking at our 
numbers on a regular basis (personalised letters + PR in industry mags is 
underway).

- Shell / BP are talking of launching similar platform 2001, but Enron only 
company aggressively marketing in Europe (look at 
http://www.eyeforchemicals.com/chem/presentations/hurley.pdf for Shell 
perspective).

- Enron brand is not known to converters/consumers  - profile awareness / 
promotion is continuous process.

- 6mo and 12mo prices are offered, as shorter term we are exposed due to the 
fact we are not in physical mkt.

- spreads are reasonably aggressive, but for hedging purposes all products 
show close correlation to each other and US equivalents.

regards
Rob Brewis

Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders 
for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the 
traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites 
with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and 
rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of 
the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of 
these customers from the energy side already.

Thanks for your cooperation

Jeff - Franz Klem of EVN is a good friend of mine - and most recently our 
best customer for coal in Austria.  He is real pissed at the way our LPG team 
has handled the Sinopec Jingling Petchem business, and made it clear to me 
that he is looking for us to hop in and lend a hand.   EVN has done business 
with the project, and apparently have had positive results to date.

The "Manfred" mentioned in his email is Manfred Ungetheum of our office in 
Germany.  I would appreciate your checking into what is going on, and why we 
are not paying proper attention to these guys. 

I will be in on Monday.  Thanks.

Dear George,

I was pleased to see you in Madrid unfortunately we had to less time for
some beers or wodkas. At the moment I am out of office for another two days,
today we have a state holiday and tomorrow I will take one day off. I have
to keep up my golfing a little bit.

George, you promised me to have a look at the LPG deliveries to China, the
situation again is as follows:

My very good friend Wolfgang Hofer has good contacts to the SINOPEC JINGLING
PETROCHEMICAL Corp., Najing, China. They plan the retrofitting and enlarging
of their polypropylen capacities for about 120.000 mtons/year. As a raw
material they need LPG and the production should start at the beginning of
2001. They want a longterm contract for 300.000 mt/y with increasing option
to 400.000 mt/y. Further they are looking for a delivery already this year
50 to 60.000 mt.
Mr. Cheng Zu Shan, the chief of planning and finance dept. was already in
Vienna and met Wolfgang Hofer. Manfred introduced Wolfgang to Tracy Wallace
and than to Eric Hanson and now we are waiting for any answer from ENRON
since weeks.

May be it is interesting for ENRON because there will be a second trading
option when Jingling offers you the products.

Please George have an eye on that business because Wolfgang has to answer
his Chinese partners very soon.

Herewith I send the name and address from Wolfgang, for the direct contact
to him:

SUMMARY

Atlantic

Over the last week we have really seen the consequences of the wet and warm 
winter in Europe with a total of some 1.7 million
tonnes being offered to us on the resell for delivery over the next couple of 
months. As a consequence spot/Q2 prices are now
trading at $2 discount to replacement from South Africa ($40.75 FOB ARA 
versus $42.75 replacement) - a concept which many are
struggling to get their head round. The Lion's share of the resell mkt is 
South African which makes sense as the strong U.S. mkt has 
taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline. In 
truth, while the U.S. mkt has been steaming, only very limited 
incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U.S. as the Utilities only 
pay up for spot spot material. If the steep backwardisation
in the U.S. rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM 
cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that the
strong U.S domestic market will keep U.S. exports into Europe very low. 

Pacific

Very few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe 
over the last few months and this has been a function of 
the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to 
the consolidation which has been going on, the latest 
development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are 
currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz 
producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a 
secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to 
lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. 
JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic 
slowdown.  At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are 
due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel 
production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see 
some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it 
will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are 
talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is
$3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle.

Gameplan

We are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 
million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We will
continue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has 
some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely 
sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving 
unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on prices
if the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in 
Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading our
way which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a 
significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sell
out of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will 
then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from the
Armada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward 
pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to 
buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are 
working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities while
the mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also 
talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts 
which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the 
Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the 
nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering 
anything further forward.

Subject: Japan - Asia markets

Mike - 

Thanks for your voice mail of Friday regarding your trip to Tokyo.  As we 
have discussed we are in the process of identifying a strategy and forming a 
team to lead our Asian coal efforts.  

We view continental Europe and Japan / Asia as the next areas of growth for 
our group.  One of our greatest challenges has been identifying and 
attracting to our group the best "Enron" people, and strong industry 
players.  We have made some progress with the recent addition in Houston of 3 
- excellent mid-marketers with industry backgrounds.  However we are still in 
the process of building a strong European organization, and staffing Sydney 
with a core group of Enron traders and industry mid-marketers.  

Clearly Japan represents the single largest market for coal in Asia.  The 
other major markets are Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and to a degree India.  The 
largest coal exporters in the region are Australia, Indonesia, China and 
Russia.  Our staffing strategy for Asia is to initially build a core trading 
and marketing group centered around 2 - 3 experienced "Enron" guys in Sydney, 
add  mid-marketers with industry experience in Sydney and Tokyo, and hire  2 
- locals in China to look after our deliveries from PRC suppliers.  

Our experience to date has shown that industry guys orphaned in a regional 
office face certain failure. As a result we are trying to avoid the mistake 
we have made in the past of hiring local industry players, and then failing 
to provide them with proper direction and support. 

We are on target to relocate at least 2 - "Enron" guys to Sydney by Jan - 
Feb.  We will continue to search for strong industry guys in Sydney, and make 
any necessary changes to our existing structure there.  We have not yet 
started to identify qualified people with industry experience in Tokyo - but 
will obviously do so.  I will get with Stu and Joe to discuss using a local 
head-hunter, and advertising in trade journals etc.

We share your views on our potential for growth in Asia and Japan, and are 
working to put a team in place that will be focused on developing a strongly 
competitive, sustainable  business in the region.  Our initial goal is to 
develop Asia to the point where Sydney is running it's own books for both 
coal and freight, and we are a major supplier in the region.

Stu and I will be in Hong Kong and Beijing Oct.  7 - 11 to meet with the 
Chairman of Shenua Coal, and senior management of Shanxi Coal, China Light & 
Power, and Hong Kong Electric.  The primary purpose of the trip is to 
encourage Shenua to perform in accordance with their obligations under our 
supply agreement; introduce ourselves to Shanxi; assure CLP that we will 
perform under our term sales agreement; and start negotiations with HKE for a 
term sales contract.

I will coordinate my schedule with Joe, and will spend a few days in Tokyo 
(Oct. 12 - 13) at the end of the PRC trip.  We can coordinate our efforts, 
put a time line in place for staffing the Tokyo office with qualified coal 
guys, and discuss our overall strategy for entering the Japanese market.

I will be in the office Mon. - Weds., and am available to meet with you and 
Jeff to discuss the above at your convenience. 

 Thanks,

George

I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG 
job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him 
coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
provided you are happy with the numbers.

Louise

ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers.

What do you think of this:

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of 
the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross 
commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and 
promote aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321.

Randy- Emilio and I had a vigorous debate today over the content and 
conclusions of the CABC Group's analysis of the questions you asked about the 
political and regulatory situation in Venezuela.  He expressed a number of 
areas of concern, some pertaining to the tone of the paper and others to its 
accuracy.

I acknowledged his concerns and promised to do my best to improve the tone 
and clarify any inaccuracies.  We will revisit with our sources to clarify 
the following issues:

1. Will the new Hydrocarbons Law just address liquid hydrocarbons or will it 
address gas hydrocarbons?  What details are available on the proposed law?
2. If the new law does affect gas, will it in effect overturn the 1999 Gas 
Law?
3.  Will gas tariffs be separate for transportation, distribution, and 
upstream, or will there be a single unified tariff?  Is there a dispute 
between PDVSA and the  Ministry of Mines and Energy on how this should be 
handled?
4. What is the current royalty and tax structure on gas?  Will it be affected 
by the new HydroCarbons Law?
5. What are the current renegotiation dynamics of the Cristobal Colon project 
between the government and foreign operators?

Once we have revisited with sources, I told Emilio that we will be happy to 
correct any subsequent errors.  However, if we reconfirm the information in 
the paper then perhaps the three of us can confer on how to proceed.

This has been a difficult assignment because we are essentially dealing with 
areas that are subject to interpretation and forecasting.  Emilio and I 
disagreed in some areas about the Chavez agenda, while agreeing in others.  
Also, because the HydroCarbons Law has not yet been written, we can only go 
on what sources in country are saying.  Clearly, we have conflicting 
information and will work to clear up the contradictions ASAP.

I suggest we postpone our Thursday meeting until both Emilio and I have time 
to conduct further follow-ups.  As I have said to both you and Emilio, the 
CABC role here is not to take any position on the merits of the deal, but 
rather to answer the specific concerns brought up by RAC.  Hopefully, these 
next steps will resolve the situation in mutually satisfying manner.

RJ

Draft:

We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets:

Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new 
finance origination activities.  In this role, he will work with all 
commodity products, assets,  and teams and lever our existing businesses with 
new this new focus.  (Do you want to put in his background--which you 
probably now more than I?)  He will be reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman.

Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick 
Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG 
markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.  (Do you want to put in 
his background?)  Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket 
relationships and  industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project 
Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.  Eric 
and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.  

Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all 
products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet 
pages exist today.  Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination 
group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial 
interface for our intranet page.  Heather was with Azurix, where she worked 
on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives. 

Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.  This group will be 
comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management 
businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics 
important to their individual markets, and discuss other  markets in a macro 
sense.  We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.  In this 
group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability 
will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a 
bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group will not be involved in 
customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will 
manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, 
Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. 

(anything else?)

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 06/2001




Highlight

Cape market is bouncing back after having fallen for the best part of two 
months.  The bounce is expected to be gentle and not long lasting.  Owners 
are raising their rates for March cargoes as there appears to be a few more 
cargoes around mostly attributed to the fact that Japanese steel mills expect 
coal and Iron Ore prices for this year to increase and are therefore 
maximising their current contracts.  Furthermore, Bunkers have risen sharply 
over the last 10 days to over $130 in Rotterdam which was not expected by the 
market.  Of interest, Bocimar is redelivering ships it had taken on short 
period last year back to the head owner earlier than their contract allows 
for which has a few owners thinking about suing Bocimar for damages.  

The panamax atlantic market has been falling hard over the last week with 
little grain movement from the US gulf and fresh Japanese concerns of GM 
crops imports from the US.  However, the Plate season is expected to start in 
March and market anticipates a return to healthy rates then.   The pacific is 
also falling from incredibly strong rates seen three weeks ago before the 
Chinese new year.

On the long term time charter with Mitsui, Mitsui has officially lifted their 
board of approval subjects and we are working through the internal 
documentation/proper sign off at this stage.  

We have offered some competitive freight rates to the US steel group to 
import steel slabs from Turkey to US in the hope of providing the freight for 
this business when it happens.  Pierre is meeting with the pulp and paper 
guys while in Houston at the end of Feb and also going through NYC to meet up 
with the Enron metals shipping guy to discuss joint efforts in shipping to 
maximise synergy's and cost savings.  Furthermore, we are currently 
discussing with the US weather group the possibility of offering protection 
to ship owners for days lost at seas due to severe weather.

Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Down	Down

I do not need to interview the person selected for the weather group.  This

Gentleman,

We are currently planning a three day trip in early March to provide you with 
the opportunity to visit the coal properties in our portfolio and meet the 
principals.  These include the following:


DPR Holding Company  Chris Cline  Beckley W. Va.
The American Coal Company Bob Murray  Galatia, Ill.
BMR Resources  Richard Gilliam  Benham, Ky.

We plan to use the corporate jet in order to facilitate transportation to 
these garden spots. You will have the option of touring all three operations 
or limiting your visits to a specific mine/principal. Each visit will include 
an underground mine tour.

Bill Giuliani will be coordinating the visits for Enron and will be 
contacting your assistant  this week. Please let us know of your availability 
and particular areas of interest.

Mike

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 38/2000




Highlight
Sold four capes to Preag for next year from Colombia to Rotterdam at $7.30 
and simultaneously bought four capes from Coeclerici at $ 7 to close out 
position at a $150,000 profit.  Fixed a Bocimar vessel for our October 
commitment to Electrabel from Puerto Bolivar to Hunterston at $8.10 and also 
fixed another Coeclerici vessel from Colombia to Rotterdam to cover our short 
to Preag in November.  Still have a late November short against Cargill from 
Richards Bay to Rotterdam to cover within the next couple weeks.

On the ABC front, met with Elcano ( largest Spanish shipping company ) to 
discuss a possible partnership to acquire ABC but quickly realised that they 
do not have the stomach for such a big deal.  However, did discover that they 
are quite active on the LNG side and are about to close on a LNG vessel 
purchase within the next couple weeks.  We are definitely going to stay in 
contact to potentially develop some alliances on the LNG side.

Late in the week heard that Bocimar had met with ABC not to purchase them but 
to discuss a pooling agreement.  From good sources were told that ABC had no 
interest in Bocimar's offer and therefore we are planning on meeting ABC to 
continue to express our interest in acquiring their fleet and more 
importantly to continue to frustrate Bocimars'attempt to control the cape 
fleet.     

We have completed our 'Enron Shipping' powerpoint presentation for EOL and we 
expect to have a shipping section within the EOL platform by mid next month 
in time for Coaltrans.  This new platform will allow our customers to log 
into EOL and go directly to our shipping web page to be able to trade with 
us.  Currently, customers have to access the international coal web page to 
access our shipping products which does not make sense to our customers

Also Pierre met in Paris with Usinor ( 3rd largest steel mill in the world ) 
to discuss some potential freight deals and also express our interest to sell 
them Synfuel next year to which they seemed quite interested.  Will revert to 
them with prices shortly.


Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat


Panamax : Market fell all week long but not to a great extent due to some 
worry about delays in US grain shipping activity
Capes : After a furious rally last week the market was flat this week as 
owners and charters had fixed all their October requirements and were 
starting to discuss November business with neither side wanting to commit
Crude markets remaining still over $30 a barrel even with the US trying its 
hardest to make it deep into the mid twenties, has also continued to make 
owners unwilling to discount next years freight rates
Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed  2+1 geared panamaxes from Indo to Hong Kong for November to January 
2001 at $6.35.

Third parties freight deals
As mentioned above fixed with Preag, Bocimar and Coeclerici on Capes


OTC 
FFA s
Bought 75,000 tons from SK Shipping  from Colombia to Rotterdam at $ 8.15 for 
October settlement

EOL
Traded with Bocimar twice and with Klaveness once this week.  Life to date 
total EOL trades are approaching 300,000 tons.  Legal late this week has 
finally authorised us to trade with NCSC on EOL so we expect to add another 
counterparty shortly.  Furthermore, we are planning a meeting with Calypso 
fund management and credit to come to a solution to allow the fund to trade 
with EOL

Deal Flow
Given the coal desk rates for Rustock, Mission, Spanish ports, Pier 9 to 
rotterdam  and also have sold to the coal desk a cape from Australia to 
Rotterdam for Feb/March 01 loading

Miscellaneous
Our new operations person is joining us this Monday ( Dorte ) and she joins 
us from Norden.  Norden is a large Danish shipping company where she had been 
working for the last 4 years

Travels
None.

Love the new place!  Hopefully you kept warm last night!  (You didn't have to 
sleep in your car, did you?) (Or did you have to drink the champagne to keep 
from freezing?)   Unfortunately I won't know about the Lay's party until 
tomorrow.  Hopefully it will work out.  
My first party--first week in Feb--Ali's planning it.
Aren't I cooler than Kenneth's brother Mark?  Just checking.

Later

Jeff

Dear Member of CAM Board of Trustees,

You may recall that several weeks ago we surveyed the Board members to 
determine preferences regarding Board meeting times. We did this because we 
have had several discussions with members who have great difficulty with the 
4 pm or 4:30 pm meeting time.

Since the Board appears to be fairly evenly split between a noon meeting time 
and a late afternoon meeting time (10 definitely prefer Noon; 10 definitely 
prefer late afternoon; and 20 have no strong preference), we have decided to 
try alternating the meetings.

Therefore, our next full board meeting, which is currently scheduled for 
Monday, January 22 at 4 pm, will instead take place Monday, January 22 at 
NOON (March meeting will take place at 4 pm).

Please note this change on your calendar and advise Cheryl Blissitte by 
email, phone (713.284.8253) or fax (713.284.8275), whether or not you will be 
attending. This is especially important as we will order sandwiches for this 
Noon meeting.

Thanks.

Marti

Subject: ARA Coal Mkt Summary

MKT SUMMARY

  Dust is settling after latest supply side incident to hit the market - 
namely the Drummond Force Majeure. What remains now is cif mkt
   which is in backwardisation for Q4 and Q1 01 versus the rest of 2001 but 
where stocks in Rotterdam are at near record highs at around
   2.5 million mt for the end of September. Indeed, utilities and traders 
alike have taken advantage of the weak spot mkt we experienced 
   during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and 
play the cash / carry game. This has certainly paid
   dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been 
swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted
   production/shipments from various geographies. While the whole curve has 
shifted north as a result of early buying interest for 2001
   the backwardisation in the frt curves coupled with above has seen Q4 and 
Q1 prices increase by some $4 over past 6 weeks to
   absolute values at $39 cif ARA - this represents a prm of between 
$0.75-$1.00 over Jan/Dec 01 run. Believe the front end will continue
   to remain tight due to supply squeeze we are feeling and high frt rates 
but going forward into next year we may see some price pressure
   from levels we are today as a consequence of lower frt rates, increase in 
prod'n, synfuel into Europe and weaker continental power prices 
   from the high levels they are today. Control of FOB origin prices through 
continued consolidation in the production side of the industry 
   could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our 
long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible. 

SPOT TRADES

Bot one pnmx of Caypa Steam coal from Masefield for December shipment FOB 
Santa Marta at $US 31 basis 11800btu.
Sold 70mmt of chinese material to EVN delivered stockpile for October and 
November delivery at what is the equivalent of $41 
fob barge Rotterdam basis 6000 kcal/kg
Switched 20mmt Australian Steam Coal Fob barge Rotterdam with Electrabel for 
20mmt of Colombian Steamcoal at agreed
differential.
Bot physical put option from TXU (still to be finalised) for Cape quantity 
for Q1 delivery with a $40 strike price basis Rotterdam
and $40.40 basis Hunterston at $0.75 cent premium with exercise date of 30th 
November.
Sold 2 x 15mmt SECA contracts to Glencore for December delivery at $40 Fob 
barge and $40.50 fob barge respectively.


SELLING SIDE

Mission continue to look for La Loma material for December delivery - now 
looking at 2 pnmx 1 into east coast and 1 into hunterston.
Bewag have tender out for 500mmt for 2001
Rheinbraun/Duisbourg combined looking for close to 250mmt Colombian material 
on delivered basis.
Working with Electrabel to offer them 50mmt a month for 2001
Veag looking for 300mmt cif Rostock for Nov 00/June 01.
EDFT after tonnage for Q4 and a cape a month Q101.
Endesa - 4 capes for 2001.
Fenosa - looking for 250mmt of low vol U.S material split across 2001.
HdelC entertaining swap of Russian material for U.S coal during 2001
Billiton looking for small parcel of Colombian material in ARA.


BUYING SIDE

Emerald - still looking to buy high Sulphur material from U.S to execute 
Preussen deal. 3 firm pnmx plus 3 options. 
Masefield - offered further pnmx cargo of 11800 material for Q1 delivery at 
$32 FOB Santa Marta.
BBC Trading - 10-15mmt Russian material ex-stockpile Sczcecin to supply our 
bewag commitments.
Putting final touches to purchasing South African Material FOB RBCT for 200. 
Likely to be a cape quantity for Q2 delivery.
AES - UK coal for Q4 and Q1 2001.
BHP - 1 June 2001 Cape.


EOL

We are just shy of reaching 500,000mt mark for total volume of tonnage traded 
via EOL with the activity that went on this week. There 
continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we 
really need to focus on converting the increasing number
of guest user ID's we are giving out into actual transactions on the system - 
many are still afraid of the technology, many are still ignorant
of how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply  
don't have the authority - hence we continue to focus
on preaching the word to all and sundry!! Highlight this week was having 
Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were 
propping the mkt up on the buy side. We are moving ahead with posting options 
on the SECA contract on EOL.

GAMEPLAN

Current mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for 2001 and 
with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for 2001
from the high levels today ($9.50 RBCT - ARA Cape) combined with a somewhat 
weaker tone in continental power prices for 01 we are fairly 
keen to hit some of this business at current price levels. We have benefited 
from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position 
but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus 
on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half 01 
shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind. 
Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage from
other geographies such as South Africa, Australia, U.S and Russia that will 
allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book.

Have extended dlist this week - if you donot wish to receive then please let 
me know and likewise if you would like people
added.

Best Regards
Jez

Hi John

Things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy.  As we go 
forward in many of our businesses, it's clear several need fine tuning.  One 
of which is weather worldwide.  Mark Tawney and I have spent quite a bit of 
time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and 
forward.  We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add 
a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer 
interaction, immediate scalability, and more portfolio diversification.  I 
would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that 
portion of the operation, and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia.  Mark 
and I will get together to structure the London based group and keep you 
advised.  

Mark has some great ideas, and I'd like to talk to you about this rather than 
go on in an email.  I'll give you a ring first thing in the morning.  

Best--

Jeff

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 39/2000




Highlight
Had a meeting with Bocimar in our offices this week as they were interested 
in knowing our plans with ABC.  From meeting it became very clear that they 
were out of the running for ABC as they were unwilling to purchase that 
company without a significant discount to current market levels.  Few days 
later, met with CEO of ABC as he had just received a bid from a rival 
shipping company ( Zodiac ) and he was basically begging us to join the 
bidding as he really did not want his company  to fall in the hands of 
Zodiac.  Pierre and I continued to express our interest in ABC but told him 
that we needed more time to evaluate their assets and could not counter on 
such short notice.  Told ABC that we would continue to follow with interest 
and that if buy out by Zodiac failed, we would come back to discuss.  Our 
goal all along was to make sure that Bocimar were not going to get their 
hands on ABC or they would have effectively controlled 50 % of the spot cape 
fleet and made our short position into next year look worrisome.  Having 
shown interest we not only were kept well advised as to what Bocimar was up 
to but it could have reacted quickly to protect our position.  We are 
relatively pleased with the potential of Zodiac buying ABC. 

Also, this week we fixed another Coeclerici cape for period.  We fixed the 
cape Asia build in 1990 for minimum 4-6 months to allow us to use the vessel 
to load out of Australia for CLP in December and hedge ourselves against a 
late winter surge in cape rates but we have the added advantage of having an 
option for a further two years to be declared mid January 2001.  We bought 
ourselves a very cheap call option with an exercise date in three months time 
in a very volatile market.  Further, Coeclerici gave us a put in year two to 
cap our downside and gave us a call option to extend the deal into an 
additional third year .  We are currently discussing with Bocimar the idea of 
putting that cape into their pool if they secure us a floor for year one and 
a share in any upside.  Will keep you posted  !!!


Fixed a 6 panamax contract as vessel owner with National power from South 
Africa to Bristol with option Immingham to give us a very useful short 
position into next year in the panamax sector.  This deal will add to our 
already significant business in South Africa for next year and will allow us 
to arbitrage between cape and panamax vessels as we hold contracts in both 
sectors.  

Furthermore, Intercore has asked us to offer them 6 capes from Bolivar into 
ARA from next March till September which if we were to win the contract would 
make us a definite market maker in the two busiest coal routes ( RBCT/ARA and 
COLOMBIA/ARA ).  


Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat


Panamax : Market continues to fall for balance of the year as China/Asia was 
on holiday this week and fixings were relatively few 
Capes : Market is steady but few expect a fall in rates for balance of 2000.  
Owners and charterers waiting for coal trans to fix for next year.

Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed  2+1 geared panamaxes from Indo to Hong Kong for November to January 
2001 at $6.35.
Agreed window of 12-21 November with MOSK for Drummond-Redcar lifting
Fixed a panamax for late October loading from Drummond to LBT at $9.80 with 
Bell ships
Sold a cape to the coal desk from Bolivar to Rotterdam at $6.85 for q3 next 
year

Third parties freight deals
As mentioned above structuring a deal with Coeclerici and Bocimar
Fixed 6 panamaxes from RBCT to UK ports for National Power for all of 2001 at 
around $10
Trying to sell 4 capes to Billiton from RBCT to Rotterdam and again  buying 
same deal with Coeclerici as a back to back with some profit.


OTC 
FFA s
No trades
      
EOL
No trades this week but EOL trader joining our group Thursday and new routes 
to be added shortly which should add liquidity and new players.

Miscellaneous
Our position as it stands now is short about 350,000 tons for balance of 2000 
mostly attributed to our November/December Colombia/LBT panamax short.  For

What do you think of this:

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of 
the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross 
commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and 
promote aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321.

Jeff -

Jean and I wanted to say thank you for the beautiful flowers you sent along.
They brightened up the place, as did copious quantities of vodka, gin, and
bourbon (mixed liberally with Reggae music).

I have been away in NYC for most of the week, and am headed there again on
Monday, so my apologies for this tardy "gracias".  I did see the Venetian 
Glass
show at the American Craft Museum, and it was quite good.  Hope to stop by 
Barry
Friedman's next week for his show, but business may interfere.

Glad to see you making headway toward becoming a neighbor.  Hope to see you 
when
time permits.

JRG

some of this number is just due to the ipe gasoil mkt closing before the 
brent.

I will highlight what is coming back in and where the money is lost by doing 
an appx m-t-m where the mkt is at this moment.

ipegasoil  +1.4
physical gasoil      .90
heat      -.20
brent      -.30
dubai     - .50
pnl clawback      +1.3

we have been reducing the risk in the book on a daily basis as you can tell 
from the var changes.  I need to go thru
with the person who does our book in houston how he arrived at last night 
numbers.  the losses on physical gasoil
seem to great to me so hopefully the money coming back in will be greater 
than my above estimate.

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Subject: EOL Products

Following are my sugestions for the next three EOL gasoline products;

1. 2nd month NYMEX UNL
2. MTBE front month swap, U S Gulf fixed price.
3. Cal 02 UNL gasoline crack spread (this one probably requires VAR increase)
4. WTI swaps that match the timing of our gasoline and HO cracks. This gives 
customers the option to convert crack spread positions to fixed price 
gasoline and HO swaps through EOL.


Regarding long dated gasoline positions we are long 75 kb per month cal 02 
gulf coast gas cracks which probably won't move much in value until 
march/April 01. I view this position as very low risk and good profit 
potential but this position does tie up VAR. If marketing can sell at $3.80 
or better happy to get out of this for now. This is the only long dated 
position in my book.

Subject: IMPORTANT: MetGas Equity Sale & SPA Disclosure

I am getting increasingly concerned about the MetGas equity sale and the pace 
at which it is proceeding.  We discussed this last week and I thought the 
consensus was to slow this process down and exclude partners who could impede 
our strategic global LNG interests -- for example Petronas and BP Amoco.   I 
now understand that we are making presentatations on the equity sale to 
potential investors next week in Singapore (BP, Petronas, CEPA, Mitsubishi, 
etc).   

I don't like the notion that we must disclose our TIGA to SPA to potential 
investors.  There are several aspects of that SPA which gives us strategic 
advantage over other competitors - for example the diversion clause of 0.5 
MMTA.  I like even less the thought that one of our partners will see the 
Master Supply Agreement (MSA) to MetGas.  Once a competitor sees the MSA they 
will have some insight on how to undermine our supply aggregation efforts and 
how Enron manages its Global LNG risk book.  This is a serious concern and we 
must ensure that it doesn't happen -- first by exclusion and then by 
negotiation (i.e. in the shareholders agreement we don't give investors with 
less than 10% equity the right to see contracts -- by the way Petronas does 
this routinely with its partners in MLNG TIGA).

Your thoughts??

Subject: lng shipping

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

Jeff,
As you suggested last week, I am letting you know that I have yet to hear
from Jeff about setting something up.  I did manage to speak with Michelle
about what she is doing and I was exited about what she had to say.  let me
know how proactive I should be about getting in touch with Jeff.  Hope you
are well.

Subject: gdansk refinery

was asked into a meeting yesterday regarding the eventual purchase of 15-25% 
of the gdansk refinery.
enron has been approached by the polish govt (and the main russian crude 
supplier JNS) to participate in this privatisation.  i have copies of the 
brief for all of you.  further background is that JNS (a smaller russian 
crude supplier) has 85% of the contracts into that refinery (and the Plock 
refinery), and controls the Druzbha pipeline.  they want us to b involved as 
the headline western company.  (the Plock ref people and the JNS people wud 
like to buy the thing but for political reasons cannot until about 5 years 
down the road.)   Therefore, we can structure our deal w/ a put option for a 
later date.
We can view this as a long crack position, with an eventual put in place 
if/when we don't like the deal.
There are other optionality benefits that need to be assessed.  (so far i 
have told them to count the trading angle as 0 profit, so that they don't 
load us up w/ a lot of bs).  We can use the facilities as a terminal.  We can 
just use the infrastructure to re-sell the crude that they get on the 
pipeline.  We can sell the ulsd they make and replace w/ regular diesel.  
Given their power needs they have their own plant but are still short 300 MW, 
so the power people like it.  etc etc.
I have already told them that we did not really want to waste our time 
thinking about this project if the specter of a reuters headline blaring that 
'Enron Buys Polish Refinery' is going to kill the deal from Skilling's 
perspective.  they assure me that they have run it by sheriff and he likes 
the power aspect and the higher profile this wud give us in poland so he is 
favorable towards it, for the moment.  rac will be looking for 20-25% roi, 
which may kill the whole thing anyway.  they have already gotten toxic waste 
indemnity from the govt.

we need to ask questions/poke holes and get as much information as possible 
out of the govt and JNS, because either they will do the deal and throw this 
in our laps, or they might pass on something that wud actually turn out to be 
interesting.  
if everybody wud please read the brief and come up w/ issues to be clarified 
by wednesday next week, i would appreciate it. thx

Jeff:

Attached you will find three files:

1) The brief description of the Envera deal you requested. ("deal summary 
final")
2) A diagram showing one potential view of how the e-Marketplace for 
Chemicals will look and where Enron would fit in. ("deal summary e-commerce 
marketplace")
3) A slide from Envera displaying their connectivity concept.  Enron will 
participate as a Member, a Service Provider and an Owner. ("basic envera 
concept")

Deals obviously are never done till they're done, but this one is 95+ % 
there.  We've received Envera Board Approval and signatures from 1/3 of the 
Owners' granting consent to issue equity to Enron.


Thanks to both you and John for your support.  We could not have come this 
far without it.





Doug

Looks like there is plenty of work to do, and I continue to believe shipping, 
etc. has great possibility for Enron.  I'd like to get a group of people to 
talk about plans going forward, and will fill you in shortly on time, where, 
etc.  One point is that it is our policy not to speak to the press without it 
being cleared through public relations first.  Your comments were 
interesting, but I was concerned about perception.  Please coordinate public 
statements, interviews, and the like through the proper channels going 
forward.   

Thanks.

		 Subject: multi-trigger option contract

following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont 
think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's 
authorization to enter into the agreement.  these are short term transactions 
and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because 
competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements.

the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does 
a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then 
claims that it was not a valid contract.  in our case, they are only 
hedging.  we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known 
up front.  therefore they will not attempt to make this claim.  even if they 
did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout.

the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty 
trying to get their premium back.  seems like a 5 second decision to me.

is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single 
long form?  by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these 
requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way.

Can you please identify for me by return Email or phone (66474) the person on 
your staff to whom I can speak regarding the services your company provides 
for Enron customers?

I am putting together a short presentation on "Other Enron Services" for a 
conference our TECASO group is hosting to discuss/promote our planned on-line 
lender's engineer due diligence services amongst numerous major financial 
institutions in early February.  The purpose of this"Other Enron Services" 
agenda item is simply to take the opportunity to summarize the multitude of 
services offered by Enron for those in attendance who may not be familiar 
with some or all of these services.  Accordingly, I'm in the process of 
gathering information on the various services Enron has to offer and, in 
particular, slides/viewgraphs covering the services offered by your company 
which may already exist in order not to have to duplicate prior efforts. 

Thank you in advance for your attention to this request.

Regards,

Ed Hlopak, Sr.

fyi - it doesn't sound like the weather piece of the Oslo long-term deals is 
going to have much value.  We are still trying to get that value from Oslo 
and ensure that the weather risk is captured appropriately in EGM risk 
books.  I will keep you updated.

Bjarne and Thor,

Thanks for the confirmation and other information that you provided on this 
deal.  I still need the associated P&L and Weather Risk transferred from the 
Nordic Power books to the Weather book.

It is imperative that this be done immediately from a Risk controls 
standpoint not to mention the fact that Quarter-end is fast approaching.  
Please call or e-mail so as to update me of your progress.

Re: Iraq/OPEC Update

Sources assess that the US will not confront Iraq over its demand to switch 
its oil transactions from dollars to euros, and therefore no major disruption 
in Iraqi exports is expected on the November 1 deadline set by Iraq for the 
switch.  The worst-case scenario now seen is a very brief "hiccup" in exports 
for a period of 1-3 days as the euro account is created and the letters of 
credit are arranged for November liftings.

Sources report that Saudi Arabia has reconciled its internal differences and 
now favors an OPEC production increase of 500,000 b/d according to the 
"trigger mechanism."  It is expected that the decision to increase output 
will be announced on Friday October 27 or Monday October 30.

I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM.  
However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too 
late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you 
need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas.  

Thanks.

Subject: Re: DPC/Metgas Equity Sale  

Clay, we've been banging this drum so long in India that we've broken all our 
drumsticks. We've always maintained that access to the Metgas terminal and 
storage and pipeline is key to any plans Enron has in the LNG business. 
Personally, I have always thought Enron should just finance and build the 
pipeline itself and then sell it once it becomes operational, maintaining 
access to the terminal and pipeline capacity. Glad to see you're on board, 
because we can use the help. 

But this is going to require some Enron commitment. To meet Enron's 
objectives (no debt consolidation, cash flow and earnings), the current 
selldowns being considered are to industry and related players who want their 
share of the upsides of the business. So giving Enron any preferred rights is 
going to be tough with these players.

Let's discuss next week in India. I have requested the Metgas meetings with 
the EGM LNG team be on Wednesday.

Subject: DPC/Metgas Equity Sale

One of the keys to growing the LNG business is access to LNG terminals and 
fuel supply opportunities. We should insure that the sell down of DPC and 
Metgas be structured such that Enron/EGM retain terminal rights and fuel 
supply rights at Dabhol, if appropriate. The Metgas terminal/regas rights 
under the TARA and EFI's fuel management/fuel supply rights under the Fuel 
Management Agreement need to stay with Enron/EGM. Lets discuss next week in 
Mumbai.

Subject: The Way Forward

Dan, in response to your question yesterday, it should still be possible to 
get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank (DB) 
had contemplated.  In that respect, last week's IRS announcement leaves 
things unchanged.

That's the good news.  However, in light of last week's IRS announcement, DB 
is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming 
Pacificorp's existing letter rulings, which they have told us was critical to 
them.  It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a non-starter from 
their perspective, at least based upon the present plan of operations.  Tim, 
is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about 
going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp 
facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their 
run-of-mine coal, consistently with their existing rulings?  I doubt it, but 
if not, we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to 
do a coal deal with Pacificorp.  I believe that Pacificorp still needs to 
unload their facilities, and they may still be able to leverage off of their 
existing rulings, which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS. 

Without a deal with DB, what are our options now?   

First, it is important to recognize that we still have options.  The IRS has 
not killed synfuel.  There has not been any change in the substantive law.  
Last week's announcement was just that -- an announcement of the IRS's point 
of view.  The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing 
private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business, which 
has been an important source of comfort to many investors, but not 
necessarily vital.  Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having 
a private letter ruling from the IRS (generally in reliance on an opinion of 
outside counsel).  We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks 
like in the absence of getting a new ruling.

One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorp's 
facilties, meaning we would relocate them, and continue running run-of-mine 
coal, the IRS be damned, and just find an equity player with a greater risk 
profile than Pacificorp.  In short, we would need companies who are willing 
to rely on Pacificorp's existing rulings, period (along with an appropriate 
indemnity).   It seems to me that if the price is right, someone ought to be 
willing to step up.   While the risk is now greater, the potential returns 
are potentially mind-blowing, and an equity player ought to be able to get an 
opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits, 
notwithstanding the IRS' current view of the law.  It seems to me that this 
is the only approach that makes sense.

Alternatively, Pacificorp's facilities could revert back to being a pure coal 
fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRS's recent 
announcement.  The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that 
process "waste coal fines," so such facilities could still qualify for new 
private letter rulings.  The IRS announcement defines the term "waste coal 
fines" very vaguely, not specifying either the coal size, or what it is that 
makes coal fines properly viewed as "waste" coal fines.  If you think in 
lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their 
announcement, I can envision that Enron could synthetically create "waste" 
coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility 
customers to provide for the sale of only coal of 3/4 inches or greater, 
resulting in a residual category of "unwanted" coal that we could separately 
market to synfuel plants as "waste" coal fines.  In other words, they could 
be fairly described as "waste" insofar as another coal customer specifically 
excluded it from their contract.  In addition, the IRS announcement does not 
require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output, as 
some commontators had feared, which is a helpful development because the 
pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity.  

However, there are real difficulties with this approach.  First, the relevant 
language in the IRS announcement defining "waste coal fines" is not real 
statutory law.  It is basically just an IRS policy statement, meaning that we 
cannot bind the IRS to it.  So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the 
IRS's choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were 
statutory law.  Also, Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS 
really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste 
fines is fines from true waste ponds.  Even if the taxpayer can argue over 
the meaning of the term "waste" fines, the IRS can stick to their 
understanding of the term, at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue 
a new ruling.  In short, the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling 
based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly 3 or 4% waste 
fines incidental to mining operations.  If you are not going to be able to 
get a new ruling anyway, what's the point of going back to being a coal fine 
processing facility?

But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach.  
Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines 
generally (i.e., not merely "waste" coal fines) as well as run-of-mine coal.  
Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more 
restrictive than the ones that they already have?  That is truly putting 
value at risk.  

In my view, the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing 
rulings as essentially "above market" rulings, insofar as they go farther 
than the IRS currently allows, giving them a competitive advantage over other 
synfuel operators who never got a ruling.  It seems to me that if they can be 
persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape, 
since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk, then we may 
still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal.

as usual we were the first group in london to spot that the enron server in 
houston was having some problems and a big back log of messages (for good 
reasons as we were anxiously awaiting  an incoming message which never came 
on one of our ship which is in a delicate situation).
why on earth is it that we don t get a warning that there is a problem so 
that we can tell our customers, suppliers to use direct fax line s or other 
means of communications  . in this instance the long awaited message was 
worth 60 000 usd but could have been much more .

As part of our process of developing a cohesive strategy for the crude & 
products origination group, we are hosting a "Strategy Session" on Wednesday, 
February 21 starting at 3:30 p.m.  It is expected to run about 3 hours.  The 
location has not yet been determined but my assistant, Beth Ryan (x57161) 
will confirm this next week.  This meeting replaces the prior meeting set up 
for Thursday, 2/22 from 8 am to noon.  Representatives from McKinsey will 
also participate/direct this meeting as facilitators to our strategic 
process.  We're finalizing an agenda which will be forwarded to you once it 
is complete.  (de la Roche/Terlip - please be sure this gets sent to all 
attendees asap).


This will be a very important process which we feel your input is critical 
and valuable.  I want to encourage everyone to not only attend but to be 
proactive in the process as well.  This will start as somewhat of a 
"brainstorming" session but our plan is to evolve into a definitive set of 
priorities, opportunities and action items which we hope will create value 
across both the trading and origination groups.  Given the size of the group, 
it has been very challenging finding a convenient time and place to 
accomodate everyone but I hope each of you will do what you can to attend.  
We've purposefully started the meeting late to try and accomodate the 
traders' schedule needs.



BETH:

WE NEED TO GET EITHER A CONF ROOM (preferably) OR RESERVE A MEETING ROOM AT 
THE DOUBLETREE, HYATT OR WEDGE TOWER, ETC... FOR THIS MEETING.
PLEASE CHECK THE DISTRIBUTION LIST ABOVE AND COMPARE AGAINST YOUR LIST OF 
ORIGINAL INVITES TO THIS MEETING.  IF I'VE MISSED SOMEONE, PLEASE BE SURE 
THEY ARE NOTIFIED OF THE CHANGE IN DATE, TIME AND PLACE.  ALSO, BE SURE TO 
LET MCKINSEY KNOW THE LOCATION AS WELL.

A Syrian, Egyptian and Lebanese memorandum of understanding to transport, 
market natural gas
Regional, Economics, 12/16/2000
In the presence of the Lebanese prime minister Rafik al- Hariri a memorandum 
of understanding was signed on Friday in Beirut between Syria, Egypt and 
Lebanon on the transportation and marketing of natural gas.

On the Syrian side the memo. Was signed by minister of oil Maher Jammal and 
minister of oil in Egypt Sameh Fahmi and the Lebanese side was attended by 
Muhammad Abdul hamid Beydoun, the minister of energy and waters, in the 
presence of the secretary general of the Syrian- Lebanese higher council Nasr 
al-Kouri.

The project aims at transporting Egyptian and Syrian gas prepared for 
exportation to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and European countries to market it to 
meet the local demands of gas in these countries.

In a statement to pressmen following the signing ceremony, the Egyptian 
minister said the pipeline worth US $ 1 billion and that it would start near 
al-Arish in Egypt in Northern Egypt and run under the waters of the 
Mediterranean to Lebanon and Turkey through Syria.

The Syrian minister stressed the importance of the project which constitutes 
a turning point in boosting joint regional Arab co-operation and which 
signifies a vivid example on integrated Arab economy.

For his part, the Lebanese minister said that this project will strengthen 
the economic potentials of the participating countries and have positive 
impact on their general conditions.

These candidates will become our next crop of AA's.  We control that with the 
Super Saturday process.  Be represented - have your people sign up now 
on-line (see below).  Thanks.  Ted

Mr. Shankman:

     I am Dan Reck's new administrative assistant.  I initially interviewed
with Jennifer and Shanna Funkhouser and knew that they were both special.
However, since I have been here (an entire 5 days now!), Jennifer has been
invaluable to me.  On my first day at my desk, she called and asked me to
come to her office and she introduced me to Cathy Phillips and Yolanda
Martinez.  The reason for this e-mail is that I have encountered some
employee problems at my location and have confided in Jennifer.  Her
professionalism, eloquence and intelligence belies her youth.  As I am sure
you are aware, Jennifer is a diamond and she will only shine brighter as
her experience grows.  Life is short and I was raised to say nice things
when warranted.  I am so impressed with Jennifer  and I am proud and feel
privileged to be a member of her team.  Thank you for your time.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Wholesale Services
To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful

potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

Doug Leach call me  this morning and told me that the offer that he made to 
the LNG group 6 months ago is now off the table. He said that this has also 
been transmitted to Mike McConnell in writing. His reason was that he had 
bent over backwards to make the proposal originally and the LNG group has 
been slow to respond. I reminded him that we were delayed in getting back 
because of some legal issues but now that we were all part of EGM that this 
was no longer an issue. He went on to say that he will not turn over any of 
the fees until phase 2 kicks in, some time next year (Marc de La Roche said 
something to me the other day about Jan.01). That the LNG group will have to 
bear all expenses until that time just like EFI had to for liquid fuels. He 
did say that in their case India did reimburse them on their previous 
expenses as a reduction/credit to the fee. He also went on to say that he was 
not happy with India's attempt to get a piece of EFI's fee.
Please advise how you would like me to proceed.

Thank you for expressing interest in investing in C.E. Unterberg, Towbin
Communications Fund, L.P. (COMM) whose portfolio manager is Amanda
Macklowe.
We have been conducting monthly openings since the fund's inception.

We will allow monthly contributions into the fund on December 1, 2000 and
January 1, 2001.  After that, subscriptions will be quarterly as per the
Limited Partnership Agreement.

To date we have raised $12 million.  Despite the challenging market we have
experienced over the past few months, COMM had returned approximately 4.2%
through the end of October.  November continues along this trend.

If you are interested, please respond to this e-mail or you may give me a
call at
(212) 389-8027.

We thank you for your attention and wish you a joyous upcoming holiday
season.

Subject: LNG Offsite -----Nov 20/21

Mike/Jeff:  

Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the 
progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's 
offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked 
these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year 
because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at 
this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.

Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international 
direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.

I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in 
the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite 
into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team 
meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.

This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on "mark to 
market" mechanics, the LNG "book", enron online and any other similar topics 
that may be appropriate.  To that end, we are working on the following agenda:

Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:  Mick Mcconnell/Jeff Shankman

LNG organization and strategic objectives:  Rick Bergsieker/Eric Gonzales

LNG risk book:     Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch??

Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brad Hitch

Mark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brent 
Price

2000 review/objectives for 2001:

Eastern Hemisphere:  Clay Harris

Atlantic Basin:  Doug Arnell/Emilio Vicens

Shipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne Perry

Legal:  Dan Rogers

Several questions:

Mike/Jeff:  would either or both of you be available to participate,at least 
for an hour or so to get us started?

Eric:  can you be there at least for Monday?

Jeff:  have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?

Brent:  can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including 
key contractual provisions required)?

FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements 
for this offsite.

Rick

This is the proposed invite list to the LNG offsite that has been scheduled 
for the Woodlands on Monday, Nov. 20. Please send me the names of any 
additions you suggest. I would like to get out a note to people on this ASAP.

We plan an all day meeting on Monday and Golf, etc for those that want to do 
so on Tuesday. That way those that need to travel or work are only tied down 
one day. I would also appreciate any agenda ideas you may want to include. 

Thanks

Wayne -

I heard back from Emilio and he said to go ahead and leave Margaret's name 
(she might be gone by the time of the offsite) but he would advise of her 
replacement.  He does not have a replacement as this time.

managed their NE gas book.

No special consideration needed.  I just promised him that I would get it to

Subject: Weekly Stats Outlook

Crude: Stocks have risen during this week over the last five years by an 
average of 7 mbbls, the smallest increase being last year's 3 mbbls. One 
reason the trend is likely to be repeated is that the SPR shipped 2.45 mbbls 
last week, and this should again show up in PADD 3, while the drop in PADD 5 
stocks (led by a sharp drop in imports) which offset the PADD 3 rise last 
week is unlikely to occur a second week. Overall imports remain high, and 
additional October barrels might just have found their way to the US from its 
closer OPEC neghbours. On the other hand, we have the Capline shutdown (due 
to lack of crude) which took place last week, and an increase in refinery 
runs out of turnaround, but I don't believe that will offset the factors 
pointing to a large build in crude stocks. (Consensus forecast up 2.5 mbbls. 
API still lower than the DOE by 2.4 mbbls)

Distillate: After rising steadily since mid July, demand finally turned south 
last week, with a 640 kbd drop. This is the first evidence that borrowed 
demand is now being paid back. A second week of stats would confirm this, but 
the weakening sentiment on cracks lends some support to the theory. The build 
last week occurred despite a strong drop in imports - providing demand stays 
low, higher runs and high distillate yields should see a build, perhaps in 
excess of 1 mbbls. (Consensus forecast up 1 mbbls)

Mogas: Gasoline demand has been sluggish for most of the year, but October 
sales were relatively strong, especially last week, which topped 8.7 mbd (8.9 
in the DOEs), not far off the year's highs. October deliveries are invariably 
higher than both Sep and Nov, so the most likely direction for demand is 
down. Imports from Canada and Europe are said to be on the way, but may take 
some time before they show up in the stats - although some improvement should 
be seen after last week's miserly 212 kbd which accounted for much of the 
draw. However, the gasoline tanker stuck in NYH may skew the stats. PADD 1 
again bore the lion's share of last week's draw, bringing stocks down to 
their lowest level since at least 1976 - it has lost 7 mbbls in four weeks. 
For RFG too, the region is looking short. This week is hard to call, but may 
point to a build, on the basis that strong demand and weak imports aren't 
sustained. (Consensus forecast down 1.5 mbbls. API still higher than DOE by 
2.6 mbbls.)

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 40/2000




Highlight
Relatively quiet week with Panamax rates drifting until Friday when rates 
seemed to stabilise.  In the cape market, rates continue to increase across 
the board with a rush of new cargoes being quoted in the market ( EDF trading 
leading the pack ).  Glencore and Anglo came into the market this week 
looking for 1 year freight rates into the UK for the BE tender with more 
mines expected to look for rates next week.  We had another visit from 
Bocimar this week as they wanted to meet the guys from MG to discuss hedging 
some of their freight exposure with aluminium which has a 75% correlation 
with the cape freight market.  Furthermore, they wanted to start trading coal 
in ARA and tanker freight which should be going live next week on EOL .

On the ABC front, we are hearing that they are in negotiations with Zodiac, 
another cape owner, but do not know the time frame of any potential deal.  We 
had this week a call from Coeclerici asking us if we were interested in 
joining forces in buying ABC so this makes a total of 4 companies having 
approached us asking to team up and as a result, we plan on exploring the 
potential of creating a consortium of buyers for ABC.

Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Up	Up	Flat


Bunkers:  With events in the middle east and continued low stocks of Gasoline 
in the US, the Fuel Oil/Bunker market is rocketing upwards with an increase 
of $30 per ton in Rotterdam in 10 days.  Over the long term these crude 
prices should derail the world economy and the freigth market but in the 
short term this will continue to sustain the freight market

Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed a panamax for early November loading from Drummond to LBT at $9.80


Third parties freight deals
Sold 4 capes to Intercore from Puerto Bolivar to Ijmuiden + Amsterdam from 
April to October 2001. 


OTC 
FFA s
Bought 150,000 tons Bolivar/Rotterdam at $8.15 for Q4 2000 from Bocimar and 
bought a panamax for Q4 2000 and Q1 2001 from Andre
      
EOL
Launching a new route on EOL next week: US Gulf to Japan on Panamax

Travels
Pierre is back from Asia and Andy and myself are all in the office

Marti asked me to poll the Board to see if there is a strong preference for 
meeting at a different time of the day than we have previously been meeting. 
Board meetings would still have to be scheduled for Mondays, since the Museum 
is closed to the public on that day, but could you indicate below if you 
would like to keep the meeting at 4 pm or possibly change it to Noon:

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for Noon

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for 4 pm

The results of the poll will be discussed at the November 20 meeting (still 
scheduled for 4 pm in Cullen).

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time 
dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather 
business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become 
full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I 
will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by 
this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important 
that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be 
in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the 
weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations 
and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide 
powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure.

Both Stuart Staley,and Dan Reck are being moved to $175k base each.  In 
looking across our vp. list, Mike and I felt like these are two of our top 
vp's, and we wanted to make an equity adjustment.  They are low at the vp 
level within ews.   

Thanks.  Jeff
