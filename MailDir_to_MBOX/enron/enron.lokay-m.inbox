Michelle, 
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is
an informal agenda listing of topics:

1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  

2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks, 

Greg Hills

Michelle
What is your opinion related to OneOk's invoice underpayments related to the Libcomb/Mocane outage.  This past due amount is getting old and it needs to be resolved?  I just don't want this difference to be outstanding on the AR aging much longer.

thanks

Michelle,

Oneok Bushton (Sherry Rogers) has not returned my calls regarding the outstanding payment of the following invoices on firm transportation contract 25374:

Invoice		Due Date	Amount		
213760		07/13/01	32,984.02	June Reservation
213986		07/13/01	  1,515.99	June Commodity (delivery of 163,009 MM's to TW/NNG Beaver, 6/1-6/11)
214462		08/13/01	35,305.88	July Reservation
214159		08/13/01	     344.12	July Commodity (delivery of 37,002 MM's to TW/NNG Beaver, 7/2/-7/31)

				(18,509.88)	Partial payment received 8/17/01 (detail unknown)

				51,640.13	Outstanding balance (not including late payment charges)


Sherry originally called me in mid July to question why we were billing the full reservation amount for June since we were experiencing a "force majeure" at the Lipscomb/Mocane lateral that included the TW/NNG Beaver (primary delivery point) facility.  The outage was termed planned maintenance for June 12, but unplanned maintenance for June 13 through July 27.  If you need any additional information, please call me.


Thanks,  Bert

Looking for a volunteer to market TW to this new power plant so that they will take the supplies off our pipe.  Any takers?

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Michelle,

We enjoyed the meeting with Transwestern and appreciate your support for our
Plan of Reorganization.

We are still looking at a purchase of pipeline capacity from PG&E Topock to
your connection with the South Point Power Plant.  The timing has changed
from when we met in Houston.  At this time, we will not be including this
contract and service to South Point in our FERC filing.  However, we would
like you to review the following proposal.

50,000 dth/day of firm capacity on the Transwestern system from PG&E Topock
to the Calpine South Point Power Plant. The price is to be $0.05 per dth
consisting of $1.395 per dth-month reservation fee and $0.0042 per dth
volumetric charge.

The contract will start with CGT acceptance of the FERC Certificate and
continue to the end date of the Calpine contract, which is the start of our
Section 4 rates.  We anticipate acceptance of the FERC Certificate at the
end of 2002.  Our Section 4 rates would start mid to late 2004.  

The start of the contract is contingent on the following conditions; PG&E is
issued and accepts an FERC Certificate, PG&E is allowed by the FERC to amend
the delivery points in the tariff to include the South Point Power Plant and
PG&E has a contract with Calpine for deliveries to South Point.

Please let me know what you think

Ben and Ron--
	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?

Michelle,

It has been more difficult than expected to get a map with the power plant
locations.  I will send you a map of the area with a general idea of the
plant locations.  I will continue to work on finding a better way to make
the exact locations.

Michelle,

A few months ago, TW Marketing and Fac. Planning had a meeting to discuss TW CAS system issues. At this meeting, you indicated that the TW Marketers would like to have some training on CAS. I have discussed with Perry Frazier & he would like to set up 30 minute one on one hands-on training sessions with each individual. 

Can you coordinate with your team & identify a list of TW Marketer's who would like to have CAS training? I will work with Perry to schedule the training times.

Thanks Ramona

It is that time of year.... Please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of November.  

Also, please complete your 2002 Objectives by December 14.  Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002.  As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting.  Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right.   

I will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items.    :>)

Thanks,
Kim.

Attached are 250 and 300 MMcf/d cases to expand TW's mainline, Topock, and San Juan lateral.  These are + 30% costs but still based on the latest E&C estimate for Sun Devil.  If San Juan lateral is not expanded, then facility modifications and costs must be included for supplies to come from the east end which is not included in this study.

Keep in mind the cases including pipe loop used the smallest diameter pipe possible.  Therefore those cases can't be expanded above the 250/300 MMcf/d level easily.

If you have any questions, please call.

The following is a level "A" cost estimate to make TW/ Lonestar existing interconnects bi-directional.


TW/ Lonestar at Ward County ( 50 to 60 mmcf/d)


According to Operations this is already bi-directional . The only things are required on this one is to take the flapper out of the check-valve 
and blow down the gas in 5.33 miles of 12".

Cost of gas loss& labor = $8,000




TW/ Lonestar at Pecos County ( 100 mmcf/d)

A): TW/ Lonestar interconnect


	Scope: On this one we need a bi-directional valve skid using the existing meter run.
	Cost of material& labor= $ 195,000


B): Pecos Compressor Station

    	 In order to make this interconnect bi-directional we also need to make the station ( two-compressor units) bi-directional.
	
Scope: Install outlet from Lonestar I/C to inlet filter with 12" piping& valves. Unit discharge would be modified to
tie in to West Texas-20"
	
Cost for material& labor= $ 330,000.
	
If you need more accurate costs ( B -release) please let me know .

	Total cost estimate for this project = $ 533,000.

As requested here is the CEC's Final Draft Report.  See Appendix A, pages 77-86.  (Lorna sent it out that's why you couldn't find it from me--sorry)

Below is my last California Interstate Capacity Report.  Perhaps this will also provide some backup data.  gh

Michelle

In order to make this interconnect bi-directional the following work need to be performed: 
( capacity 35- 60 mmcf/d at 800-850 # pressure)

1):  Blowdown gas in 5.335 miles of 12" ( gas-loss) at 1000# pressure

2):	Remove a flapper in the check-valve or turn around the existing check-valve


The  cost for this is approximately $8,000 to $10,000.

Still waiting for Earl Chanley from Roswell to send me some facility information regarding the Pecos interconnect.

     	Michelle,
	Just a quick revision to Dave's note below.  The end month for the original 
term should be October 31, 2002 (instead of September 30, 2002); and the 
beginning month for the second term should be November 	30, 2002 (instead of 
October 31, 2002).  If you have any questions please call me,  Dave is out 
today.
	Thanks,

Michelle,

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign 20,000 
mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the period beginning 
June 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002.  During the four month period beginning 
October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 2003, the primary receipts will be 
reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.  Beginning March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary 
receipts will be increased to 20,000 mmbtu.  

For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 
2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options prior to 
electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.

Best Regards
David Smith

Please plan to attend a meeting regarding TW's Order 637 filing immediately following Steve's staff meeting on Monday, March 24.  We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting.

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

Here is another matrix of TW "Current Shipper" rates & surcharges.
This one is not posted on the web.
I don't know whether anyone needs/uses it, anymore, but I have been keeping it up.
There is a new tab for each change in Current Shipper Rates.
The latest is "200111"

Elizabeth - I forgot to send this to you this morning.  
Jeanette - I don't recall whether I sent this along with the other TW files.

Subject:	Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG"- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

Michelle,

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign
20,000 mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the
period beginning June 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002.  During the
four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28,
2003, the primary receipts will be reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.  Beginning
March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary receipts will be increased
to 20,000 mmbtu.  

For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February
28, 2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options
prior to electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.

Best Regards
David Smith

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!
Kevin Hyatt x35559 & The Enron Kids Committee
