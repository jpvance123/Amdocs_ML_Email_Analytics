Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Mat

Chris,

I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
fundy responsibilities. 

Mat

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

Ina,

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.  
Thank you.

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on 
the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 
mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not 
physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five 
synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong 
counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the 
meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Hey buddy, what's happening?  Not much up here these days.  I took last week 
off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.  I'm pretty 
much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.  

Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked 
to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any 
chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid 
process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I 
need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.

Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, 
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the 
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers 
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It 
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the 
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a 
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these 
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant 
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause 
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day 
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I 
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as 
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

Mat

Matt,

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat

disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
"unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Angela,

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with 
a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be 
loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D 
Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Mat

David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
"Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.  

Mat

We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente

Sara,

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?

Jeanne,

Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value 
from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on 
the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, 
Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the 
week.

Thanks you.

Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?

Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.   

Mat

Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar 
pipeline.  Thanks.

Yan,

Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we 
discussed.  The other report is called West_3.  Also, the CIG/WIC report 
should be added to your webpage, but it's not ready yet.  Thanks.

The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.  It says 
6 pm, but whatever.  I'll probably go then.  If you guys aren't ready, maybe 
I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico 
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you 
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth 
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm 
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment 
than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there 
are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of 
holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently 
been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so 
my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the 
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help 
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae 
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some 
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in 
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a 
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, 
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just 
drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was 
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I 
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to 
hear what's happening on the island these days.  

Take care,

Mat

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 
9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was 
out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an 
Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you 
think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that 
goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary 
link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be 
called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm 
still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", 
with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link 
is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from 
Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the 
Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the 
page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Chris,

Here are the additional manual entry meters.  Those highlighted in blue 
should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new 
records.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will 
leave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report

This is strictly for testing...provided it goes well, we will activate

production).

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Here are the headers:

1.  PIPELINE_ID
2.  EFFECTIVE_DTM
3.  DATA_REFERENCE_NUM
4.  FLOW_TYPE_CD
5.  MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_QTY
6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY
7.  AVAILABLE_CAPACITY_QTY
8.  PIPELINE_CYCLE_ID

These are the column headings needed for the historical data Excel files 
(they do not have to be in any particular order, but initially a template 
should be created, and then used throughout).  This format makes it a simple 
process to load this information into the database.

Thanks for all of your hard work!!

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you 
need more info.

Steve,

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to 
determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from 
Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily, 
Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily 
decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the 
curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.
