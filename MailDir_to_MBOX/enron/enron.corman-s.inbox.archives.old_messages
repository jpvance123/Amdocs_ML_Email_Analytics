Shelley mentioned in her staff meeting that there would be a Dynegy Operations Meeting every Monday morning at 9:30 for the shared personnel to attend.  Can you please let me know if this is something Ellis or Gary should attend since measurement results and PPAs are a hot topic for NNG.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Issue 45 (sample copy) 

 EDITORIAL <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/pics/newsletter/hedit.gif>	
It remains an interesting time for the energy sector... 

In a scenario vaguely reminiscent of the California energy crisis, most of the news focuses around one big story- the continuing Enron saga. There's no lack of stories about the Enron disaster, and each one seems to be more dire than the last. With Congressional probes, security guards posted at Enron's headquarters and the recent sacking of an Andersen partner, it looks like the story's still got a way to play out. You can keep up with all the latest including Al Massey's ongoing articles and interviews at Eyeforenergy. 

We've got a packed briefing for you this week. After focusing the last few editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy trading in both the US and Europe, we're taking a closer look at two other issues of interest to the energy community-emissions and weather. Two of the articles below focus on the growing market in emissions trading-the first a look at the market, how it's developing, where the money's to be made, and the second article takes a closer look at the regulations governing the market. We've also got an article on the latest developments in weather trading which seems to be a growing part of many energy traders portfolios and is increasingly popping up on Risk Managers' radar screens. 

All these articles serve as an excellent segue into a few announcements here at Eyeforenergy. Just a quick reminder about the upcoming European Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in mid-February. We're quickly running out of hotel space, so if you're planning on registering make sure to do it soon before space runs out. Also, we're issuing a call for papers for our upcoming Emissions Trading show in the US... if you'd like to get involved drop our conference Director, Sarah Robinson a line at srobinson@eyeforenergy.com <mailto:srobinson@eyeforenergy.com>.

 FOCUS <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/pics/newsletter/hfocus.gif>	
Emissions Trading: The Emerging Market 
Mention greenhouse gas (GHG) today and you conjure up images of shrinking polar ice caps, rising oceans, depleted rain forests, expanding deserts and even rising crime rates. Although there is still much dissension among the ranks of scientists and environmentalists as to the impact GHG has on the environment, there can be little doubt the earth's climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases - primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

The heat-trapping property of these gases is undisputed. Although uncertainty exists about exactly how earth's climate responds to these gases, global temperatures are rising. In recognition of the role greenhouse gas plays in global warming and climatic change, representatives of more than...

Energy Policy in the U.S. 
They say Washington is a town of give and take. The second session of the 107th Congress will resume later this month, and it is scheduled to take up the nation's energy policy legislation in February. These actions will amend the 1992 Energy Policy Act; renewable energy and climate change sections will probably be debated with significant vigor...

 INSIGHT <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/pics/newsletter/hinsight.gif>	
Energy and Weather, an Explosive Combination 
With threats of a new El Ni?o forming in the tropical Pacific, predictions of warmer weather, where it is supposed to be cold and colder weather where it is supposed to warm, a new star is born, the meteorologist. Faced with paper-thin profit margins in a highly competitive market, risk managers have come to rely on meteorologist and weather forecasters as their secret weapon in developing strategies to keep their companies from being held hostage by the weather.

Weather forecasting is something akin to a black art, worthy of Merlin the Magician, for most of today's executives. Few can predict the impact each degree higher or lower than the expected temperature, will have on their company's financial statement. Fewer still have the skills necessary...

Despite the stance of the Bush Administration, state and industry action suggests a growing interest in greenhouse gas trading opportunities in the U.S. 
Expect to see "Bush" and "Kyoto" back in the headlines as the U.S. Administration prepares to unveil its alternative plan for controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In March 2001, the Bush Administration announced that it would be abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, suggesting that the treaty was "fatally flawed" and would harm the U.S. economy.

Despite protest from Europe, Japan, and other proponents of the treaty, the Administration has stuck to its decision. So for those of you that are anxiously anticipating the start of a vibrant, global market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions, with the largest potential buyer participating...

 NEWS ROUND UP - WEEK IN REVIEW <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/pics/newsletter/hweekin.gif>	
Debate over Global Warming Heating Up 
January 2, 2002--- New Zealand's Business Roundtable has come out against the government ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on climate change while the minister, Pete Hodgson, has given more reasons why it should be done sooner rather than later.

In article just released, Mr Hodgson says New Zealand produces less than 0.2 per cent of world emissions but emissions per person are the fourth highest in the developed world, including large methane emissions from farming. 

Carbon dioxide emissions have increased faster than the population... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 25022> 

Environmentalists Push for GHG Regulations 
January 24, 2002----In what is shaping up t be a last ditch duel, pitting the oil and auto industries against environmental groups, battle lines are being drawn as California seeks to become the first state to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars.

The one-page measure would order the Air Resources Board to lower the amount of carbon dioxide -- one of several greenhouse gases -- spewing from the tailpipes of California's 29 million cars and light trucks. 

If the bill doesn't pass the Assembly before the end of the month, it dies.... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 25019> 

Lay Out at Enron 
January 24, 2002--- In an announcement that was met with surprise by some but inevitable by close observers Kenneth Lay resigned his post as CEO of embattled Enron late yesterday. Defiant in the face of mounting pressures from ex-employees and creditors, Lay said the bankrupt energy trader needs a fresh leader to turn the company around.

Lay, faced widening criminal and political investigations, finally agreed with creditors that the company needed new leadership, if it is to emerge from bankruptcy. 

As more than a dozen regulators and congressional committees line up to take their shots at him, Enron spokesman Vance Meyer... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 25010> 

Australian Companies Face Fines over GHG 
January 23, 2002---New South Wales is set to become the first state to establish compulsory greenhouse emission standards for its power industry. The Premier, Bob Carr, set the wheels in motion with a position paper that aims to end a failed voluntary scheme, under which standards have gone backwards, and replace it with a compulsory one which would fine companies if they did not comply.

The scheme, which could start as early as July, will almost certainly mean increased electricity bills for consumers, although the Government insists the increase will be small. 

Mr Carr will also release a report by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal that says power firms have... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 24963> 

U.S. Close to Kyoto Alternative 
January 22, 2002---After receiving mounting criticism for pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol, the United States is close to formulating an alternative plan on global warming that stresses containing greenhouse gas emissions rather than cutting them, sources close to the government said Saturday.

But the initiative to be put forward by the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases is likely to spark further international criticism as it links emission cuts to economic growth rates and fails to require companies to carry out reductions. 

The plan, expected to be announced as early... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 24911> 

Dutch Announce $40 Million CO2 Plan 
January 22, 20022---The Dutch government has inked an three-year $40 million contract with the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) will also provide the Netherlands with credits toward its carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction target laid out in the Kyoto treaty to trim greenhouse gas emissions.

In signing the deal, Environment Ministry spokeswoman Babette Graber said, "We are now the first country to use state money to buy C02 (credits)." She added, "The IFC will identify and select the projects in developing countries." 

Under the Kyoto treaty, industrialized nations must cut emissions... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 24910> 

Enron's Blame Game Continues; Andersen Points Finger at Company's Business Model 
January 22, 2002---The dot-com meltdown and the Enron debacle are combining to make Sir Walter Scott's old adage "Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive," a metaphor for the 21st Century. 

Like schoolboys on the playground the Enron saga is full of charges, counter charges, finger pointing and blame. The blame game continued in full force Sunday as the head of Arthur Andersen blamed the energy company's business model as the source of its failure.

Q,

What does it look like for you?  Can you leave early enough today to pick up
a sleeping bag?  If not, I need to know as I would like to pick it up at
lunch.

Love

Kim

	My change would be:
	Negotiated and implemented the EAMR Citizen's Service Agreement providing Citizen's with Gas Control and transaction management services with no addition to staff and generating $100,000 in payments for the service provided by Gas Logistics.

  	I have a question about Elizabeth Brown being promoted to a Coordinator.  Last year there was a big deal made about changing all the Coordinators to Specialists	which upset some of the personnel.  Are we going to start using the job title of Coordinator again or should her title be Sr. Contract Admin Specialist?

Please review and add appropriate information into the attached draft 2001 accomplishments.  I'd like to circulate this document on Monday to fulfill the promise that I made at staff meeting.

FYI - I'm taking a day of vacation tomorrow because my babysitter is unavailable.  I will be around the house most of the day if you need me.  You can also call on my cell or send me an email.

The market took very close to the 1550 schedule.

We shifted extra linepack East of Station 13 prior to the scheduled downtime.

In the middle of the night last night it became apparent that station 13 was not going to come back on-line -- vibration problems.

Allan Weatherford has another crew coming in who may have another idea for resolving the problem. He will notify Rick Craig first thing this morning.

If you see Rob or Bob you may want to mention this problem at 13 to them -- sometimes they call in.  Previously we had this same problem at station 13 because the station was incorrectly designed with too much pipe unsupported above ground.

The weather forecast shows mild weather, and we can continue to meet a 1550 market demand with station 13 down.

Steve and Shelley,

Included in our 2002 general plant capital was a $50,000 item to replace UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) A which provides the power for Gas Control on EB42 and also serves Enron Security. Within Gas Control it supports the Gas Control Center, the Computer Room, and the Mux Room. Randy Lord had recommended that we plan on replacing UPS A in 2002 due to it's age and other issues. UPS systems generally cost a good deal more than $50K but we hoped to leverage some of the UPS equipment in the Enron building that would become available. 

For the past 2 months we have been working with Charles Upshaw to determine what existing equipment we could utilize and what the cost would be. For various technical reasons the newer, available UPS systems could not be used to replace UPS A without costly modifications. In the end, a much cleaner, cheaper, and effective approach was to leverage the 50KVA UPS on level EB44 and simply run a new feeder to a new panel on EB42. Option A below describes the recommended approach and the estimated cost. Instead of replacing UPS A, we will simply provide a redundant power supply to the computer room and mux room equipment, continuing to maintain UPS A for as long as it makes sense.
The UPS on Level 44 will also provide conditioned and reliable power to several small areas on level 44. In addition to being very cost effective, this approach gives us redundancy for several single points of failure in the existing system. 

Charles Upshaw, James Sumpter, John Wilhelm, and I recommend proceeding with Option A. Please reply to this note with your approval and/or any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary x33094

Gentlemen,

Here are the options that we have evaluated to date.  The Engineering Cost is a hard price. The Electrical and Acoustical numbers are estimates at this time. Once an option is chosen and the engineering is complete, we will review the drawings for any unexpected  surprises and  communicate changes to you(if any) prior to proceeding. The estimates are based on services being provided during normal business hours only and all payments must be made prior to service being provided. Once Engineering and drawing review is complete, I would anticipate the project to take 2 weeks complete. Please review and contact me if you have questions or require further information.

Option A:

Provide a new 120/208 volt panel board in the data center on the North side of level 42 of the Enron Building.  Provide new feeder from existing 120/208 volt panel on level 44, being served from the existing 40KW/50KVA Powerware UPS system also located on Level 44, to the new 120/208 volt panel board on level 42. Provide (4) quad outlets to be located in the MUX room on level 42 with whips fed from the new 120/208 volt panel in the data center.  Also provide (20) new whips from the new panel to existing equipment located in the data center.

Engineering Cost                      $3,900.00
Electrical                                 18,800.00
Acoustical/Protection/Clean        3,031.00
Total.....................................$25,731.00

Option B:

Relocate existing 40KW/50KVA Powerware UPS system with associated 120/208 volt panel board from level 44 and reinstall in the old UPS room on level 42.  Provide primary feeder from existing 480 volt panel located on level 44 to the new location on of the UPS unit on level 42. Route 120/208 volt feeder from the UPS unit to the newly relocated panel.  Provide (4) whips to the MUX room and (20) new whips from the relocated panel to existing equipment located in the data center.

Engineering Cost                        $6,200.00
Electrical                                   32,500.00
Acoustical/Protection/Clean up     3,031.00
Total.......................................$41,731.00

Option C:

Provide new PDU in the data center on level 42. Disconnect and reuse existing UPS "B" feeder that serves MTS-42-1 to feed new PDU. Provide (4) new whips to MUX room and (20) new whips to existing equipment located in the data center.

Engineering Cost                             $3,900.00
Electrical                                        33,800.00
Acoustical/Protection/ Clean up            909.30
Total............................................$38609.30

Attached is an updated reherasal schedule, the handchime schedule is
included.  The worship committee approved Sunday, April 28 during the
Sunday School hour for our program.   We are finishing up a week earlier
than last year, but the Sundays in May are already booked.

I have moved our Saturday rehearsal to the afternoon instead of the
morning.  We lose a lot of kids to baseballl, swimming, dance rehearsal,
etc.  I have put the rehearsal from 3:00 - 5:00 on April 27.   After the
rehearsal, I would like to feed the kids dinner and have a little choir
party.   Because of our baseball theme, I would like to have hot dogs,
sodas, maybe some popcorn.    We can also celebrate our May birthdays at
that time.

(See attached file: Choir Schedule - Spring 2002.doc)

Thank you so much, Shelley.  I, too, am sad that this all happened to Enron.


I have been in touch with Rick, Mike and Steve but I will send an email to
Lynn to cover all the basis and I appreciate your touching base with them
also.  
Thanks again... Georgi

Hi Georgi,

It's nice to hear from you -- although I wish it were under happier
circumstances from your end.  I know that your visited with Mike and Steve
on gas control openings.  Please also keep in touch with Rick Dietz for
contract group openings and Lynn Blair for potential scheduling openings.
I'll also touch base with them and let them know that you may be responding
to upcoming job postings.

Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These "5" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate "5" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.

Shelly 

Thanks for sharing the infomation in the meeting this morning.  I realize these are uncertian times, but now I feel a bit more positive about things.  I am not a meeting person. but in these times it is good to be informed.  If the morning is too difficult for you, maybe you could have the meeting at the 6:00 pm crew change.  Thanks and look forward to working with you with the  challenges that we face.

Thomas

 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/>	 Three trading conferences under one roof...
at the Hotel Okura, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002	 
 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/>

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Aquila, Systeia Capital Management, Mirant, LIFFE, Element Re, Entergy-Koch Trading, Risk Management Solutions, Centrica, Utilicorp, weatherXchange, Aon Capital Markets and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c459583>...

UBS Warburg estimates that profits
from European power trading alone
will top $2.4 billion in 2002

Add natural gas and oil and you're looking at a huge pot of pure profit, only available to those companies that know how to best take advantage of the rise of deregulation and online trading in the European market. 

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Dynegy, Altra Energy, OM Group, Powergen, Bergen-Energi, Amsterdam Power Exchange, RWE Trading, ENDESA, The Utilities Exchange, TXU, SchlumbergerSema

"Carbon credits represent a significant asset that companies ignore at their peril"
Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it - you really can't afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

BP, European Commission, Shell, Amerada Hess, Powergen, RMS, Fortum, Natsource, RMC Group, EcoSecurities, Rolls Royce, KfW, Point Carbon, IETA, TransAlta, UK Dept of Environment, and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c45bbc4>...

"Congratulations on a successful conference! I found it extremely worthwhile. The structure and content were well-balanced, the organisation tight, the venue first-class and the discussion, both in and out of the conference hall, interesting and valuable."
Ian French, Frost & Sullivan, Europe

Shelley,  While I'm out of the office 2/1 thru 2/11, Mike will work directly with the Reps for setting scheduling capacity or any pipeline issues that arise.  TMS issues are addressed though the Hottap Help desk.  Galen has the reservation billing under control and Jim Studebaker will continue with the meetings for defining requirements on FGT's segmentation, EPSQ for ID1 & ID2 cycles and the Gulf Stream market allocation process.  I will have my Blackberry unit with me and should be able to receive emails (except when at the ski resort in Colorado) and pages with no problem.  (Blackberry phone number is 877-550-7985.)  Sheila

Shelley:

  Yes, we can!!  My Bible Study starts at 5pm. I have an hour!  We may change 
the Bible Study to an earlier time though due to the Super Bowl and then I 
will have more than an hour. Either way...I know I will be there.  Please 
know I am praying for you for strength and perseverance as you contine to be 
with Enron. I am sure things are not really comfortable right now but I sure 
am glad they have a wonderful light of Christ's witness like you to be among 
all the darkness.  My heart is still mourning the gentleman who ended his 
life. I pray there will be no one else. Alina grows in leaps and bounds each 
day. I see her at ACEC and she is pure delight. She yells a greeting to me 
when she sees me and it lights up my heart.  I am not sure what she is saying 
but we know each other and it really thrills me to see her smile and her 
little hand waving.  She is such a blessing!  Everyone shows her so much 
love. At Sunday school last week we all really gave Chad encouragment and 
affirmation that he is now the big brother.  He seemed pleased and a wee bit 
shy about all the attention.  Hope and pray we were not toooo much for him.  
Shelly, if you ever get stuck for someone to keep the kids for a while...I 
would be honored if my schedule permits.  Just wanted you to know! 
Thanks for all you do and are doing! I can't wait to begin beating the drum 
for VBS.
In Him,
Patty

State Bar of Texas
Texas Bar CLE

"THE ENRON DEBACLE: NAVIGATING THE PERFECT STORM", a new course by Texas Bar CLE, will be presented March 1, 2002, at the Radisson Astrodome Hotel in Houston. 

Course directors Richard Orsinger and Craig Ball are presently recruiting a top-flight faculty for this timely and important program, which promises to examine discovery issues; employees as plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses, and whistleblowers; class actions; shareholder remedies; insurance; the collision of criminal and civil matters; juror focus groups; managing the media; and jury selection in a high profile case. Obviously, many important facts about Enron are yet to be determined, so the program topics will be presented in the hypothetical voice. 

Register for  $195 and receive extensive written materials. 
MCLE Credit: 6.25 hours (.5 hr. ethics credit)

Please visit http://www.TexasBarCLE.com for more details and registration information.

Shelley - 
See when Patty is available, and I will attend if I can.  All the dates you 
mentioned are possible but not certain for me, except for Sunday, which is 
bad for me. (We will not be in church this Sunday.)  I am particularly 
interested in seeing what the Children's Church curriculum looks like...
Thanks, Shelley!

Shelly:

I have a visitors luncheon on this Sunday but can meet between 1:30 and 
5:00pm if
Sunday would be good for you. I have the Covenant College on Saturday. I can 
meet during the day most times...I can shift my schedule to meet yours 
anytime. I am thankful for your continued work in this ministry!  I am hoping 
we can proceed with our ministry team for children's church as we discussed 
prior to Christmas.  I will meet with you whenever the others can meet. Okay? 
 Thanks!
Patty

Thank you, Shelley, for your offer.  Our clubhouse was not available, so I 
have decided to have the shower  here at my house.  I am dealing with my 
"problems" and have decided life goes on!  It will be fine.  I am looking 
forward to entertaining - we haven't done anything like this in a while - too 
long!
Yes, I will add those names to the guest list.  I am very comfortable with 
the number of guests.

Received your thank-you letter and appreciate it, especially with the picture.  My prayers are with you and your family.
Just wanted you to know what a great job Alma Carrillo did in planning your shower, ordering the cake and punch, and collecting money for the gift.  I think she deserves a very special thank-you.
See you tomorrow at the staff meeting.
	Alma G.

Attend the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring Conference: Power Markets 2002: Risk and Reward, April 17-18, 2002, at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed. 

Come hear the experts who will help you survive and thrive in 2002! 

Topics 

Transmission and RTOs: Representatives from PJM, Cal ISO and Midwest ISO on their respective regions.

Credit: Susan Abbott of Moody's on evolving credit standards in our industry

Insurance: Scott Ettien from NCM, Lynda Clemmons from Element Re and Pat Toner Goudarzi from ACE, on Credit Insurance, Weather-risk Insurance and Innovative Insurance Products, respectively

Exchanges: Monte SImpson of InterContinental Exchange and Brad Leach of NYMEX on the growth in the use of exchanges.

Markets: Chris Pollatos of Mirant, Dave Freeman of Panda and Mike Young of Aquila on the state of various aspects of the power markets.

And More! Cabell Poindexter of Wyndham Mills on job prospects! John OBrien of Skipping Stone on the outlook for Transmission! Henwood on outlook for powerplant construction! Adrian Palmer of Caminus Corp on European Markets! 

Fundamentals of Power Marketing. On April 16, Scott Spiewak will be repeating his "Fundamentals of Power Marketing" preconference seminar. Essential for the new industry participant, it is also a valuable overview for the industry professional.

	NNG - Called SOL Sunday morning for Sunday's Gas day.  The Reps
	called as many customers as they could to let them know.  We had
	the SOL posted on the WEB before 9:00 a.m.  We also did a pop up
	on TMS for any customer logging into the system.

	New TW HOTLINE will be implemented this week.  We are working with
	Kim Watson and TK.

	We did a production migration last night (Sunday).  So far everything is
	OK.  

	TW was quiet this weekend from a scheduling perspective.

	Thanks. Lynn

Dear Shelley:
Sounds like a good start on your list.  Feel free to add more as you think of 
them - you only have 15 names, and I am comfortable adding more.  
One question - is Kidsave International the organization you worked through?  
 Where are they located? 
We can talk more this weekend.  I'll see you Sunday!
Thanks,
Barbara

	I talked with Barb Bishoff who is setting up the Measurement
	meeting for Mary Kay and Dave Neubauer.  She said it will
	probably be next week since she is having trouble getting both
	Mary Kay and Dave at the same time.  

	I told her it was critical that Shelley be in the meeting.

	I told her Steve, Rick and I are optional for this discussion.

	Thanks. Lynn

Crucial factors that will be discussed include strengthening data security and protecting against cybercrime.  The planning and creating inherently resilient infrastructures and assisting policymakers in developing adequate legislation to safeguard the nation's energy supply and distribution.  Hear about Security measures that these industry leaders are adopting: Utilicorp United, Inc., Rochester Gas & Electric Corporation, PEPCO, National Regulatory Research Institute, National Association of Regulated Utility Commissioners, Electric Power Research Institute and many more.

Representative Jeff Morris of the Washington State Legislature and Chair of the House Telecommunications, Technology and Energy Committee will keynote at CBI's Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry. http://www.cbinet.com/events/PB231/index.html  The Federal Bureau of Investigation will discuss how Houston's National Infrastructure Protection Center benefits the energy industry.   

Join this outstanding group of speakers at the only conference that gives electric power executives the chance to benchmark their security procedures with peers and experts.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/>	 Three trading conferences under one roof...
at the Hotel Okura, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2001	 
 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/>

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Aquila, Systeia Capital Management, Mirant, LIFFE, Element Re, Entergy-Koch Trading, Risk Management Solutions, Centrica, Utilicorp, weatherXchange, Aon Capital Markets and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c459583>...

UBS Warburg estimates that profits
from European power trading alone
will top $2.4 billion in 2002

Add natural gas and oil and you're looking at a huge pot of pure profit, only available to those companies that know how to best take advantage of the rise of deregulation and online trading in the European market. 

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

"Carbon credits represent a significant asset that companies ignore at their peril"
Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it - you really can't afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

BP, European Commission, Shell, Amerada Hess, Powergen, RMS, Fortum, Natsource, RMC Group, EcoSecurities, Rolls Royce, KfW, Point Carbon, IETA, TransAlta, UK Dept of Environment, and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c45bbc4>...

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Subject: FW: Americans - The following was supposedly written by a dentist in Australia.  In the event that isn't true, it's still a nice piece. 

"You probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but there was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American.  So I just thought I would write to let them know what an American is, so they would know when they found one. 
  
An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. An American may also be Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Australian, Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan.  An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot, Navaho, Apache, or one of the many other tribes known as native Americans. 
  
An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim.  In fact, there are more Muslims in America than in Afghanistan.  The only difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of them choose.  An American is also free to believe in no religion.  For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God. 
  
An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each man and woman to the pursuit of happiness. 
  
An American is generous.  Americans have helped out just about every other nation in he world in their time of need.  When Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country.  As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in Afghanistan.  The best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes. 
 
Americans welcome the best, but they also welcome the least. The national symbol of America welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed.  These in fact are the people who built America.  Some of them were working in the Twin Towers on the morning of September 11, earning a better life for their families. 
  
So you can try to kill an American if you must.  Hitler did.  So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the world.  But, in doing so you would just be killing yourself.  Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place.  They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom.  Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.  
  
So look around you.  You may find more Americans in your land than you thought were there.  One day they will rise up and overthrow the old, ignorant, tired tyrants that trouble too many lands. Then those lands, too, will join the community of free and prosperous nations.  And America will welcome them! 
 
Pass this around the World!

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 2
>From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16
>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

Energy Info Source's U.S. Transmission Report is a 550-page, 4 part report which provides all you need to know about the fast changing transmission industry. The report takes a wide-ranging look at changes in the structure of the business, assesses current and projected reliability issues, examines how transmission is effecting bulk power markets, and analyzes the FERC-mandated RTO filings. 	
  <http://www.pmaconference.com/imagesemail/id000013/ustran1.jpg>	
Now in its 15th year of publication, Wheeling & Transmission Monthly is the only source of comprehensive information on transmission and bulk power filings at the FERC. Every filing at FERC during the past month is summarized, complete with docket number for pulling the entire file. The most important filings are featured in "Bulk Power Highlights."

Hi Shelley:
I am getting out invitations for the shower today.  I am sending one to you 
and Alina so you can see it.  Here is the guest list so far:
Giok Boothe
Lisa Corder
Linda Corredor (co-hosting)
Jacque Daughtry
Sydney Free Duvall
Peggy Erwin
Nancy Ginsburg
Dawn Goddin
Ange Grout
Wendy Houghton
Barbara Howard
Stephanie Keesling
Carla McGinley
Kathy Mynarcik
Becky O'Reilly
Dorothy Pledger
Letha Russell
Pam Thyssen
Ann Turney
Patty Wehn-Glowski

I do need to clarify the following:
1)    Did you say yes to inviting Tami Head?  (My notes aren't clear.)
2)    You listed Cherie Otto on your list.  I know that she and Barbara 
Bakanic are very close friends.  Barbara is also in our S/S class when she is 
not teaching.  Do you think we should invite both of them?
3)    You were going to get me Gabby's (sp?) address.
4)    I thought of Maggie Van Syckle.  Are you close with her?

If there's any one else you think of, just let me know.
Thanks,
Barbara

Whether 'tis nobler to face the sunshine and warmth of spring or take shovels to driveways of snow, and by opposing end them...

Dear Domestications Shopper,

"To be or not to be..." though not quite as philosophical a dilemma as Hamlet's, this is the question that will confront the world's greatest prognosticator, Punxsutawney Phil, a.k.a.-the groundhog-as he makes his annual prediction between winter and spring on February 2. 

Regardless of Phil's forecast, spring is already in the air at Domestications. Our newest catalog will be arriving in your mailbox any day. It's filled with great new products like our Down-in-a-Bag set, a down-filled revision on the classic Bed-in-a-Bag(R); Concerto Comforter Set, a woven jacquard comforter set that beautifully combines textures; and our luxurious 100% cotton Sateen Bed-in-a-Bag(R) sets that capture the richness of sateen at an incredible price!

Friends,
 
David Duff's mother (73 years old) was killed in a car crash this morning at around 9:30 in Denver, CO.  He will be flying out tomorrow and will fly back next Thursday.  He will be out tomorrow and all next week.  
 
David's dad has died previously.  His mother was apparently on the way to pick up one of the grandkids, accidentally ran a red light, and was hit by an SUV.
 
Please remember David and his family as he travels to Denver.

send this to one person at a time to ensure all names get added to same list and @ 500 it can start over with another and another until the government gets the message. PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION BELOW AND PASS THIS ON UNTIL THERE ARE 500 NAMES THEN SEND TO: President@whitehouse.gov <mailto:President@whitehouse.gov> 

Dear President Bush: Many of us were deeply touched to hear you recite a portion of Psalm 23 in your address to this great nation in the dark hours following the terrorists attacks. We were encouraged and comforted to know that we truly had a believer working with us and for us in our nation's highest office. We the people of America are requesting that you lift the prohibition of prayer in schools. As the pledge of our great country states, we are to be "One nation, under God." Please allow the prayers and petitions of our children in schools without the threat of punishment.Currently, adults and children in the schools are prohibited from mentioning God unless of course His name is uttered as part of a curse or profanity. Madeline Murray O'Hare is dead. Let her legacy of atheism in our schools die with her!             &nb! sp; Sincerely,  The People of America 

Mark 10:13-14 "People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."

Ancillary Services Conference

 

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

 

The brochure for the Ancillary Services Conference, April 10-12, 2002, Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link below:

are 8:30, 10:15, 10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:15, 12:45.  Hope you can donate!

We sincerely regret to inform you of a tragedy that occurred earlier today.  Cliff Baxter passed away this morning.  Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes.

The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates. 

How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?

Thanks: John Buchanan

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the "other" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says "empty deleted items folder upon exit".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call us at:


ETS Solution Center - Houston		713-345-4745

Hi! The invites are nearly ready to go. I just need the map to Rosemary's
home. 

Also, Shelley -- we discussed that you may want to direct people to certain
things or places for gifts (e.g., books). Let me know what you the invite to
say and, if clothes are still an option, remind me what sizes.

Thanks!

Attend the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring Conference: Power Markets 2002: Risk and Reward, April 17-18, 2002, at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed. 

Come hear the experts who will help you survive and thrive in 2002! 

Topics 

Transmission and RTOs: Representatives from PJM, Cal ISO and Midwest ISO on their respective regions.

Credit: Susan Abbott of Moody's on evolving credit standards in our industry

Insurance: Scott Ettien from NCM, Lynda Clemmons from Element Re and Pat Toner Goudarzi from ACE, on Credit Insurance, Weather-risk Insurance and Innovative Insurance Products, respectively

Exchanges: Monte SImpson of InterContinental Exchange and Brad Leach of NYMEX on the growth in the use of exchanges.

Markets: Chris Pollatos of Mirant, Dave Freeman of Panda and Mike Young of Aquila on the state of various aspects of the power markets.

And More! Cabell Poindexter of Wyndham Mills on job prospects! John OBrien of Skipping Stone on the outlook for Transmission! Henwood on outlook for powerplant construction! Adrian Palmer of Caminus Corp on European Markets! 

Fundamentals of Power Marketing. On April 16, Scott Spiewak will be repeating his "Fundamentals of Power Marketing" preconference seminar. Essential for the new industry participant, it is also a valuable overview for the industry professional.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Hi! Are you going to get a ticket for the Best Dressed Luncheon?  Do you want to buy a ticket? $500 each.  Rosemary said she would get us good seats!  The luncheon is Tues. April 2.  Would Cindy want to go too?

I just bought a ticket from Rosemary.  It benefits the March of Dimes (and we probably aren't going to have an Enron team this year).  Also, Rosemary said we could sit at Nancy Kinder's table.

The Receivables relating to the imbalances in A/R should not be considered income exposures.  However the IES imbalance receivable needs to be resolved by March 2002, if we are to include the amounts in the next UAF tracker filing.

Subject: Status of A/R


This memo is on behalf of myself and Lynn Blair.   

The following is an update on the status of our effort to resolve/clear past due receivable items currently sitting in the a/r aging report. 

A/R-Imbalances, Transportation, Late Pay charges 
The attached report reflects all of the remaining A/R items over 30 days related to imbalance, transportation and late pay charges including any unapplied cash.  Gas Logistics has worked very diligently to ensure the A/R is up to date.  Where there were problems, they recruited the help of Marketing and were very successful in bringing closure to some A/R issues.  The items to be included in the write off package (totaling ($3,486.75)) are designated as such and summed separately on the attached report.  Gas Logistics has provided explanations/resolution plans in the right hand column of the report.  To summarize the report, there is exposure of $1,534,792.  Of that, $1,563,897 is made up of four customer issues (Hutchinson Utilities, IES Industries, MidAmerican Energy and Utilicorp-CCI bankruptcy).  There are currently reserves set up for MidAmerican, $221,429 and Utilicorp, $98.496.  

Beginning immediately Gas Logistics will include an aging report for all outstanding a/r as part of the customer accounts status package.  This package has been and will continue to be distributed to all  account managers monthly.

Gas Logistics has the initial responsibility to collect payments from shippers and will involve the account manager when an issue or collection problem occurs.  However the account manager will also have the responsibility to keep themselves informed as to the status of their shippers accounts.  The reports provided to them in the customer accounts status package will help them do so.

Work orders 
Outstanding work order receivables are being researched and reconciled by Tim Bayles in John Cobb's organization and they plan to resolve these balances independent of the transportation-related effort.  Currently it is our understanding there is approximately $1.2m of outstanding work order receivables with $.6 reserved in December, 2001.  Mike McGowan has offered Laura Lantefield's assistance with getting these resolved.   

OBA's 
OBA's were not originally included as part of our a/r focus however Gas Logistics is already putting the same effort into resolving/clearing any OBA issues.  Currently OBA's over $200,000 are included in the customer accounts status package.  Gas Logistics is preparing a report similar to the a/r report for OBA's under $200,000.  This report will indicate which OBA's are reconciled and which ones need a resolution plan.  

Please let Lynn or I know if you have any further questions.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.  Each block of numbers will experience an outage of a few minutes during which calls made to an affected number will not go through and will not roll to voice mail.  The numbers affected are: 345-5000...6999; 713-646-6000...6599; 713-646-7000...7999; 713-646-8200...8399; 713-646-8600..8699; 713-646-9700...9799; 713-345-0200...2999.  The number 713-345-7000 to access voice mail will not be affected by this maintenance.  However, any number within these maintenance groups will be affected regardless of whether it was moved from 3AC.  This change will impact ETS users.

TECHSTRATEGY RESEARCH

Building Tier Zero Auto Collaboration - Report
W. Daniel Garretson, January 2002
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,13024,00.html

     Collaborative product development promises big gains as automakers
     bring better vehicles to market faster. But to capture benefits, OEMs
     must use emerging online tools to shift process ownership to tier
     zero suppliers.

Canada's Collaborative EBPP Future - Report
Ron Shevlin, January 2002
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,14374,FF.html

     Today, Canadian companies and consumers eschew online bill
     presentment. To spur growth, epost and e-route must build a
     cooperative hub for all billers and re-focus their competitive
     efforts on front-end services.

Making Mobile Gaming Pay - Report
Carsten Schmidt, January 2002
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,14049,00.html

     130 million Europeans will play mobile games by 2005 if the industry
     can move past today's broken business models. Operators must track
     and share revenues while marketers sponsor branded games.

Sizing US Consumer Telecom - Report
Charles Golvin, January 2002
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,12812,FF.html

     New communication options already displace plain old telephone
     service in 1.7% of households. Traditional telcos' share of the
     consumer communication budget will drop from 49% in 2001 to 33%
     in 2006.

How To Choose Online Partners - Report
Anna Glos, September 2001
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,14389,FF.html

     Online financial service providers look to distribution
     partnerships to carry them through this period of slow sales.
     This strategy guarantees financial success only if firms select
     the right online partners.

The Net Tames The Pension Beast - Report
Nastasja Senn, September 2001
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,14197,FF.html

     Financial service providers (FSPs) must implement Internet
     solutions to reduce service and administration costs of Germany's
     new pension system. Firms that act now can use pension networks
     for cross-selling in 2004.

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.

FYI - 
The Dynegy team that visited last Friday will be on site this Thursday AM, to review items from the "NNG Request - Revised".

We do NOT plan on having a group mtg, but they would like to review individual items that are available.So...if you had items available for last Friday's mtg. but they were not discussed please put them in EB43C2. (As previously mentioned I will also send out assignments on the new items Dynegy added to the "NNG Request - Revised".)

To help facilitate data review, Bob Chandler and John Cobb will begin working more closely with Dynegy (Carolyn Stone and Biren Kumar), and they will contact you on an as needed basis.

Thanks for your continued assistance.

Call me if you have any questions.

Sandy

Please move the attached AR lines items to Enervest - customer #4000002858

These invoices had been billed to Enervest but recorded under ENA's customer number.  In the past, the invoices were paid by ENA; however, the invoices for November and December 2001 will be paid by Enervest.

thanks

We sincerely regret to inform you of a tragedy that occurred earlier today.  Cliff Baxter passed away this morning.  Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes.
