Doug,

Lots of traveling going on over here.  How about yourself?  We're still
producing bucket loads of CL2, but are always open to seeing what kind of
deals you have to offer.  I think I still owe you a beer.  Let's plan on
lunch one day.

Steve

Steve,

What is happening out there? Still busy producing bucket
loads of chlorine
or are you slowing down ready to do some power??

Trust all is well,

take care,

Gentlemen,
??? As you probably know, my  brother Rich is jumping on the matrimonial 
hand-grenade this August 25.? To  provide him with sage-like advice and help 
him prepare (in what may be called a  double-vision quest) for his day of 
reckoning, my brothers and I are planning to  take Rich on a pre-wedding 
retreat. In all likelihood this weekend will be the  last one of July 
(27-29), with the first one of August (3-5) as a backup  date.? The locale 
will probably be Lake Travis outside of Austin (see www.bartoncreek.com for 
more information  about accommodations).? Early morning golf, swimming, 
evening entertainment  in Austin are the planned activities.
??? Certainly more information  will be forth coming, but if joining Rich for 
this weekend is something you  would be interested in doing, then please 
contact me.? My home # is  860-435-1389.? My emails are 
tom_pastore@indianmountain.org  and pastore@discovernet.net  .?? I hope to 
hear from you.
?
Tom Pastore

Happy New Year!  I hope you and your family are all happy and well, and I
just wanted to send a little hello from snowy Boston.

I finished my first semester at Harvard Business School relatively
unscathed.   It's really strange to be a student again!  I am enjoying it,
and am
learning a ridiculous amount, and there is just way too much information to
actually ingest.  It's good fun,
but some of the people are really arrogant!  The people are not as nice as I
thought they would be.
They're all very interesting, but a lot of them are just investment bankers
who want to back into investment banking.
The profs here are fantastic, however, and it's been a very interesting
semester.

I would love to hear about how you're doing, about Enron North America, etc.

What ever happened to the S. Texas wind deal?  You know I am going to keep
asking you about it... I hope that the turbines have ALREADY been built
and you're making tons of money off of them!

All the best, and Happy New Year!


Claire

Mike,

By now Dave Delainey's office should have received by fax signed copies of 
the PPA and GPSA.  I am attaching a redline version of both documents for 
your review as well.   



I am also attaching a copy of the most recent Garrad Hassan letter describing 
their view on the project at this time.  

Concerning your question about the timing of the energy production, as we 
discussed  the GH analysis is focused on the factors which decrease the 
energy production of the project.  They have not questioned the accuracy of 
our hourly data collection, or when the wind blows.  As you can imagine, 
determining when the wind is blowing is the science and definable part of 
this work.  The art and interpretation lies in forecasting the factors which 
decrease the energy.  As a result, there have been no changes in the on-peak 
off-peak ratio.  In other words, the production curve should be identical 
other than the downward shift.  Please don't hesitate to call me if you would 
like to discuss this further.



I will be in CA and reachable at 661-823-6855, or by cell until 11:00AM PST 
Thursday, returning to the Houston office Friday morning.  Please also feel 
free to contact Bob Gates at 661-823-6730 should I be unavailable.

Thank you,
Michael

Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 
2001.  There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the 
other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load 
data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most 
directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), 
although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the 
two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% 
higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days 
before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously 
have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 
3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year 
from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

In addition to the proposal made by Manny, we'd like to propose the the 
attached
as a further modification to the unit specific dispatch for consideration by 
the
RUG on Dec 6 or 7.  This language proposes to base premiums on the Resource 
plan
rather than current output.  This is consistent with what ERCOT has proposed
with OOME and is more appropriate than basing the premiums on unit limits.

These are the two presentations I had already done before, I hope they are 
what you are looking for. I'll work next week making a paper about all I had 
found. I would send you a copy when I get finish it.

That's right!? I will be joining Global Energy Markets (G.E.M.) as a managing 
director of coal and emissions trading.? Last month, Allegheny Energy 
announced the acquisition of Merrill Lynch's energy trading division, G.E.M., 
for $490 million plus 2% equity interest in Allegheny. The main purpose of 
this transaction is to combine G.E.M's established trading and risk 
management business with Allegheny's substantial portfolio of low cost 
generation. The transaction is expected to close before the end of this 
quarter.? I will be trading and optimizing Allegheny's coal and emissions 
positions.? G.E.M. will continue to be headquartered in Manhattan.? Allegheny 
has a great portfolio of coal and gas generation (approx. 18 million tons of 
coal consumption per year) and has a dynamic five-year plan for further 
growth through acquisition and development (18,000 MW by 2005).? I am 
extremely excited to be back in the 'coal game' and especially to work with 
the deep pool of trading talent at G.E.M.? 

I will be starting my new position as soon as my obligations to Sithe have 
been fulfilled.? In the meantime, I can be reached by cell phone (917 913 
8873) or at home in Manhattan 646 840 1300 (fax 1515) or email?? 
btubaron@aol.com .? I really appreciated the assistance I have received over 
the past several months that has ultimately led to me choosing this 
position.? Thanks to all involved!

Happy New Year!

The Operating Guides WG, with much support from Bob Brodie of KEMA
Consulting, have been working to conform the ERCOT Operating Guides with
the new market structure as defined in the Protocols pending approval at
the PUC and scheduled to be implemented on June 1, 2001.

Attached is a zip file containing a complete version of the 'NEW' Operating
Guides for your review and comment.   The intent is to have the Guides
ready for review and hopefully approval by TAC's newly created
subcommittees at their first meetings of 2001.  This message is being sent
to the members of the 2000 TAC subcommittees (ES/RSS/TMOS) in anticipation
that there will be significant overlap between the membership of the 2000
subcommittees and the 2001 subcommittees.

There will be a meeting/workshop in Austin on Tuesday, January 9 to collect
and discuss your comments on the attached document.  The specific location
will be provided later,  but the meeting will start at 9:30 and end by
4:00.

The first thing you will notice is a very different document structure and
format.  Of note, they contain Hidden text.  If you are using a WORD
version earlier than 2000, there are a couple of options you will want to
enable to be able to see and/or print this text.  From the Word tool bar,
go to  Tools / Options.  Select the View tab and make sure the Hidden Text
box is checked to be able to see it on your screen.  Select the Print tab
and check the Hidden Text box to have it printed.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this effort as you start your busy
new year.


Feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss.

Clement, 
Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties for the 
Indian Mesa II project.? In each, we have changed the materiality threshold 
from $50M to $100M and removed the brackets from Oregon as Enron's state of 
incorporation.

Team:

We had a very productive meeting with ABB today.  Attending the meeting from 
Enron's side were Drew Tingleaf, Scott Laidlaw, Carlos Sole and Mike Curry.  
Dave Duran and Louise Kitchen spent time emphasizing our commitment to this 
project and some of the steps Enron is taking to see it through to 
conclusion.  

Attending from ABB's side were Svante Svenson (president of ABB HVDC 
division), Lars Carlson (project manager) and Mike Sandridge (sales rep).  

Both parties agreed to the following actions and schedule:

1.  Enron will by April 30, 2001 (Monday):
 a.  draft a letter amending and reinstating the EPC contract of 10/27/00 
(the "Letter") and send it to ABB for their comments.
 b.  draft a revised Exhibit Q (cancellation payments).

2.  ABB will, by May 4, 2001, provide Enron with the following: 

 a.  propose a new schedule to the EPC contract (to replace the old schedule 
A-2) providing for both notice to proceed ("NTP") and corresponding 
guaranteed completion dates ("GCD") between May 1 and December 31, 2000 on a 
daily basis.  ABB verbally stated their strong commitment towards achieving 
an overall project schedule of 15.5 months between NTP and GCD.
 b.  Revised Exhibit A-1 and Y.

3.  ABB and Enron plan to execute the Letter by May 9, 2001.

I will schedule a team meeting next week to bring everyone up to speed on 
exactly where we are with other aspects of the project.  Please call me with 
any questions you might have at x36649.

Michael,  Wanted to follow up our conversation today with a note summarizing 
EPMI's thoughts.  I know neither of us thought that Garrard Hassan's analysis 
would drag on this long (since end of November) so I thought it would be 
appropriate to re-address where we are.  At this point, I think EPMI is 
looking for two things from EWC:

1) We understand EWC's concern with Garrard Hassan and the affect their 
estimates for wind speed have on the economics of the Indian Mesa project, 
but EPMI needs EWC to place a deadline on when EWC will have enough 
information in order to sign the agreements.  My expectation is this should 
be in the next two weeks (after another meeting with Garrard Hassan)?

The reason for this request is that opportunities for EPMI to resell some of 
its renewable energy position (should EWC sign the agreement) are now 
starting to appear in the market and those opportunities will be lost if EPMI 
is unable to consummate.  Also, as you know, the power market is volatile and 
any large movement could quickly kill the economics of our PPA from Indian 
Mesa.  Lastly,  EPMI will soon need to make decisions regarding dedicating 
time and money in preparation for accepting and managing the intermittent 
wind power.  Bottom line is that the deal's value will start to decay the 
longer delay in EWC's signing.  

2) EPMI expects EWC to not compete with EPMI on renewable energy 
opportunities in Texas (specifically the Austin Energy RFP).  EPMI has in 
good faith negotiated this agreement with EWC and needs to be able to pursue 
these opportunities with EWC's cooperation in anticipation that EPMI will 
have a signed PPA from Indian Mesa. 

At your earliest convenience could you please give me a call to address these 
concerns.

Thanks, - Mike

I concur 100% with Doug on this issue.   We need to stop dancing around the 
issues.   The hybrid proposal does not satisfy the trading organization's 
needs for an efficient real time market with a supply and demand curve.

I am not confident that Tabor's will deliver a credible message that will get 
the changes we need in ERCOT.

Subject: Tabors visit to ERCOT

Jim,

I have just reviewed Tabors' proposal for a hybrid solution to RTOs and I do 
not feel that, at this point in time, this does the ERCOT desk any good 
whatsoever. It is simply a continuation of what the PUC has already seen from 
his counterpart, Dr Oren, and does not meet my expectations for a feasible 
market. I have not been impressed with Tabors understanding of our trading 
business and do not feel that this latest model forwards our efforts at all.

The purpose of the meeting on the 15th is to review the real-time congestion 
management mechanisms currently proposed and not a forward hybrid market. If 
we have two associates who are saying the same thing we do not achieve our 
goal of changing this situation. Furthermore, it simply means we end up 
signing on to a flawed market design which, I am sure, is not in anyone's 
best interest; commercially or politically! We have not been implicated in 
the failings of California's design because we did not sign up to the initial 
proposal there. It would be very foolish to sign up now to an equally flawed 
model.

I would like to have a quick meeting to discuss this so that we can forge 
ahead with the ERCOT gameplan. I will not accept a bastardised version of the 
current proposals as a solution for this market. It does not allow either EES 
or ENA to operate productively and will ultimately fail. I am confident we 
can get over any hesitations we have using other market experts to present 
the case and I know that there has been great interest in this. This should 
also fit in well with the efforts being led by Jeff Brown on the RTO side and 
is consistent with our discussions Tuesday.

I trust you will be able to accommodate us with a request to hammer this out. 
The business opportunities far outweigh the 'issues' we have with ditching 
Tabors' model in this market. We believe that having Hogan present at the PUC 
will undoubtedly forward our various causes in a much more effective manner. 
Furthermore, his cache with the utility crowd is an important consideration 
in getting them to understand our business and transact with us. 

I look forward to hearing from you and trust we can get this resolved today 
so we can get back to business.

Thanks,

Doug

Attached are five (5) pages illustrating my discussion points on local
congestion issues for the December 14, 2000 meeting.  I do not plan to vote
on this -- simply to discuss issues and potential solutions.

Jim,

I have just reviewed Tabors' proposal for a hybrid solution to RTOs and I do 
not feel that, at this point in time, this does the ERCOT desk any good 
whatsoever. It is simply a continuation of what the PUC has already seen from 
his counterpart, Dr Oren, and does not meet my expectations for a feasible 
market. I have not been impressed with Tabors understanding of our trading 
business and do not feel that this latest model forwards our efforts at all.

The purpose of the meeting on the 15th is to review the real-time congestion 
management mechanisms currently proposed and not a forward hybrid market. If 
we have two associates who are saying the same thing we do not achieve our 
goal of changing this situation. Furthermore, it simply means we end up 
signing on to a flawed market design which, I am sure, is not in anyone's 
best interest; commercially or politically! We have not been implicated in 
the failings of California's design because we did not sign up to the initial 
proposal there. It would be very foolish to sign up now to an equally flawed 
model.

I would like to have a quick meeting to discuss this so that we can forge 
ahead with the ERCOT gameplan. I will not accept a bastardised version of the 
current proposals as a solution for this market. It does not allow either EES 
or ENA to operate productively and will ultimately fail. I am confident we 
can get over any hesitations we have using other market experts to present 
the case and I know that there has been great interest in this. This should 
also fit in well with the efforts being led by Jeff Brown on the RTO side and 
is consistent with our discussions Tuesday.

I trust you will be able to accommodate us with a request to hammer this out. 
The business opportunities far outweigh the 'issues' we have with ditching 
Tabors' model in this market. We believe that having Hogan present at the PUC 
will undoubtedly forward our various causes in a much more effective manner. 
Furthermore, his cache with the utility crowd is an important consideration 
in getting them to understand our business and transact with us. 

I look forward to hearing from you and trust we can get this resolved today 
so we can get back to business.

Thanks,

Doug

Parviz, complete information to answer your
questions is not part of our current systems at
ERCOT.  The operational systems do not
archive/retain data.  We are looking into what
information we can gather but this may take some
time.

For the cost questions the only available data is
redispatch for unplanned and planned service.  It
is posted in accounting reports and is available
on the Internet at the following address:

ftp://ftp.ercot.com/unplannd/redispth/uredispt.htm
l
ftp://ftp.ercot.com/planned/redispth/redispth.html

Realignment is at owner's cost and ERCOT does not
receive/collect this information.  It will be very
hard to determine total impact without this
information.

Steve Myers, Security Operations Manager and his
staff are looking into available data to answer
the operational questions.

Some information relating to unplanned
transactions is available in the "Monthly
Transmission Market Operations Reports"  available
on the Internet at the following address:

ftp://ftp.ercot.com/unplannd/mtmorept/mtmorept.htm

In addition, past performance of the system does
not denote future performance.  Generation and
transmission are changing on the system every
year. Traditional methods of analysis using known
generation resources and pairing them with known
load are no longer possible.  There is significant
uncertainty in the existing generation that will
be displaced by the addition of new generation.
There is significant uncertainty regarding  how
their operation affects existing resources and the
transmission system.  The CSC calculations we
provided are trying to simulate these possible
transactions and determine the limitations with
the ERCOT stakeholders.

Hope this helps.  Thanks Ken D.

questions.  If I come up with more, I will forward
them to you in advance of
the meeting.

On a historical bases covering 1997 through 1999,
and 2000 (if data is
available), could you please provide the following
annual information for
ERCOT:

1. The total cost ($) impact of realignment
(or redispatch)

ERCOT System Planning has prepared calculations
and data to support the identification of
Commercially Significant Constraints (CSC). A
meeting to discuss these calculations with
stakeholders will be held:

Wednesday, January 31
9:30 AM to 3:30 PM
Red Lion Hotel in Austin (I35 & 290)

The goal of this meeting is to identify which
transmission system contingencies and limiting
elements are commercially significant.  After
CSC's are determined at this meeting, ERCOT will
develop a recommendation and present it to TAC at
their February 7 meeting.

We have also set up an email account to receive
comments.  Its email address is

csccomments@ercot.com

it will be available throughout this process to
receive comments and input.

Subject: New Power QSE Agreement- execution copy

Michelle -- As discussed, attached is a redlined and an execution copy of the 
New Power QSE Agreement, for your review and transmission onwards to New 
Power's Anoush Farhangi.  The document is being cc'd to the EPMI recipients 
you had designated.  For their benefit I direct their attention to the 
confidentiality obligations stated in Section 7.2:  in particular, EPMI will 
be under obligations to keep New Power's scheduling and settlements 
information confidential from EES and EES personnel.
 
Michelle, please note to New Power that: (1) New Power still needs to fill in 
their contact/payments information on Schedule A. (2) the Enron Guarantee 
format was not referenced in the document as Schedule E and Schedule E was 
therefore eliminated.  Per the Credit Support Annex, each guarantee must be 
in a format acceptable to the other party.  (3) The lengthy ERCOT Calendar 
will be kept current on the MIS website, so it was not included as 
'Attachment X' to the document.

Please call me with any questions or comments. --David

Maybe I/you should complain to the benefits department regarding the dental
insurance situation. Serena (at Dr. Crowe's office) said she talked to a
Mary C. at Met Life in July, 2000. Mary said Met Life covered 80% of the
occlusal adjustment (code #9952). Then when I called yesterday they said it
has never been covered and MetLife has rejected the claim which means we
have to pay another $400. Let me know the benefits number and I will give
them a call.

Thanks!

Texas May Face a Glut of Electricity,
But It Won't Help in the Rest of U.S.
Pride and Policy Make State a Magnet
For Power Plants and an Island Unto Itself
By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVOand RUSSELL GOLD 
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
While California struggles to keep its lights on and New York City braces for 
possible electricity shortages this summer, Texas utilities could soon face 
the opposite problem: a power glut.

Texas' wide-open spaces and relatively weak zoning and environmental rules 
have helped make the Lone Star state a magnet for power-generation companies 
as it prepares to deregulate its electricity market next year. The result: 
Texas' electricity-production capacity this summer is expected to exceed its 
peak power demand by 11,000 megawatts -- nearly enough to light up New York 
City. By the summer of 2002, the excess may be closer to 15,000 megawatts, 
enough to power 15 million homes. And with 27 new generating plants under 
construction, more than any other state, some power producers fear that 
overbuilding ultimately could send Texas' wholesale electricity prices into a 
tailspin.
A Grid Apart
All this sounds like good news for the electricity-starved East and West 
Coasts -- but it isn't. That's because the U.S. is divided into three major 
power grids -- with the West on one, the East on another and most of Texas on 
a third, with very few links to the rest of the country. In the world of 
electricity, that makes Texas "an island with a couple of little footpaths 
over to it," says Larry Makovich, senior director for electric power research 
at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm.
Some Texas utility executives argue that their state's island status is 
principally an accident of geography. But no one disputes the fact that good 
old Texas pride -- and a deep-seated skepticism toward federal regulation -- 
also played a role in shaping the state's grid. So, too, did a renegade 
utility's desperate 1976 bid to save itself from a corporate breakup and the 
resulting four-year legal battle, which the industry later dubbed the "Texas 
Range War."
Texas' isolation isn't expected to end anytime soon. If Texas became fully 
interconnected, its big utilities say, the state could become more 
susceptible to blackouts, if other regions drew off too much power. "From a 
reliability standpoint, it would be a degradation to the Texas grid," says 
Steve Schaeffer, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Inc., the former 
Houston Lighting & Power Co.
Competing Interests
Moreover, the utilities estimate that building the transmission lines needed 
for a full connection to the nation's other grids would take at least three 
years and cost Texas ratepayers about $600 million. They don't want to invest 
that much money to sell power to California or New York to ease what they 
view as temporary imbalances.
Some in the state also believe low rates and excess power could give it an 
advantage in persuading businesses to locate there. "America will be shy 
enough electricity that this will be one of our greatest inducements for 
growing Texas," says Matthew Simmons, president of Houston investment bank 
Simmons & Co.
Texas is an extreme example of the haphazard way electricity grids developed 
in the U.S. Until the 1960s, most power plants were built near the customers 
they served. Then, utilities began building larger, more-efficient coal and 
nuclear plants, connecting them with their neighbors to ensure that if one of 
these big plants went down, there would be a backup ready to keep the power 
flowing.
'No Big Money'
But the old-line Texas utilities, which have long benefited from the state's 
plentiful supplies of fuels such as natural gas and lignite coal, were 
reluctant to join in this wave of interconnections. Back then, in the 
mid-to-late 1970s, electricity outside Texas was generally more costly. And 
surrounding states weren't planning big enough plants to back up the huge new 
ones Texas was building to power its fast-growing cities and energy-thirsty 
petrochemical industry. "There was no big money to be made by shipping power 
one way or the other over the lines," says Reliant's Mr. Schaeffer.
By confining their grid to Texas, state utilities also avoided oversight by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Thus, FERC couldn't force Texas to 
send power out of state in case of an emergency.
The state's dominant utilities -- Texas Utilities Inc., the Dallas-based 
predecessor of what is now TXU Corp., and Houston Lighting -- went to great 
lengths to ensure there were no interstate connections. The switches at a 
hydroelectric plant on the Texas-Oklahoma border were wired to prevent power 
from flowing between the states. Elsewhere along the border, a system of 
relays was installed to prevent unauthorized interstate transmissions.
Only one big utility didn't like the setup: Central & South West Corp., a 
Dallas holding company that owned power plants in both Texas and Oklahoma. In 
1976, it faced a crisis. If it couldn't show that its plants in both states 
were interconnected, it ran the risk of being broken up under a federal law. 
The law, which barred holding companies from owning unconnected utilities in 
separate states, was decades old. But, until then, it hadn't been strictly 
enforced.
On May 4, 1976 -- eight days before the Securities and Exchange Commission 
was set to consider the matter -- Central & South West took an extraordinary 
step. At 5:30 a.m., it sent one of its line crews to secretly rewire a 
substation in Vernon, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, allowing power to flow 
freely between the two states. For a few hours, the grids were connected by a 
minuscule thread. Later that morning, officials at Central & South West 
phoned other Texas utilities to tell them the company was engaged in 
interstate commerce.

Texas' other major utilities reacted angrily. "The sons of bitches are trying 
to steal my lignite!" Texas Utilities Chairman Louis Austin bellowed, 
according to former Texas Public Utility Commissioner George Cowden, who 
recalls Mr. Austin making the remark during a private meeting between the two 
men.
Around noon, Houston Lighting cut its system off from the rest of the state's 
utilities. Texas Utilities followed suit hours later. By day's end, the 
state's utilities had broken the grid into a half-dozen pieces.
That same day, one of Texas Utilities' chief lawyers, a 6-foot-6 former 
college-football star named J.A. "Tiny" Gooch, dispatched one of his 
company's crews to disconnect the link Central & South West had made between 
Vernon and Altus, Okla. "They made it so it was physically impossible to 
[connect] it again," says Mr. Gooch's son, Gordon, then a lawyer representing 
Houston Lighting. The elder Mr. Gooch, who died in 1986, is considered the 
patron saint of Texas' electrical independence.

At an emergency meeting of the utility commission three days later, Mr. 
Austin of Texas Utilities expressed disgust at the prospect of having to burn 
Texas lignite and natural gas to satisfy "Yankees," according to a 
transcript. And, he added: "I don't like federal regulations." (Mr. Austin 
died in 1997.)
A wire reputed to have formed part of Central & South West's brief 
Texas-Oklahoma interconnection later was cut into pieces, encased in Lucite 
and given out as paperweights by Dallas law firm Worsham, Forsythe & 
Woolridge, which represented Texas Utilities.
Alan Erwin, a state utility commissioner in 1976 who still has the souvenir 
on his desk, used the wiring episode as fodder for a 1979 novel, "The Power 
Exchange," in which a winter storm cripples Northeast power production and 
the nation turns to Texas for electricity. Texas refuses to ship the 
electricity, fearful that other regions would drain it of "what little cheap 
fuel was left." Ultimately, Texas becomes a scapegoat and ends up seceding 
from the union.
Real-Life Compromise
In reality, the outcome was less dramatic. The grid conflict wound its way 
through many courtrooms. Central & South West -- recently acquired by 
American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio -- lost almost every round. 
After about four years, the utilities hashed out a compromise, at the urging 
of the federal government.
Rather than link the Texas grid to the East, so that electricity could flow 
freely across state borders through alternating-current cables, they agreed 
to build two direct-current lines. Operators could control the flow over 
these bridges, which at peak capacity could carry a mere 820 megawatts. The 
parties to the deal, which included the federal government, agreed these 
links wouldn't bring the Texas grid under federal jurisdiction. Today, Texas 
power continues to be regulated in Austin, not Washington.
"It's just a Texas thing," says Pat Wood III, chairman of the state utility 
commission and a recent Bush administration nominee to FERC. "We want control 
of our own destiny."
That independent attitude has extended in recent years to Texas' 
business-friendly approach to deregulating its power industry. Unlike 
California, with its stringent emissions and zoning rules, Texas has made it 
quick and easy for power companies to locate their plants almost anywhere 
they can find a place to hook up to the grid. Last year, Texas completed a 
major upgrade to alleviate bottlenecks on the grid, and it has six similar 
projects under way. Unlike most other states, it decided to charge grid users 
a flat rate to move power anywhere in the state, so they could put plants in 
low-cost rural areas, far from their customers.
Those policies, as well as projections that the state's electricity demand 
would grow by a robust 3.5% a year, set off a flurry of power-plant 
construction, beginning in 1998. Since then, $11 billion worth of power 
plants have been completed or started in Texas, and more are on the drawing 
board.
By contrast to California's approach to deregulation, which largely failed to 
bring new plants online, Texas' strategy "encouraged an overbuild," says Mr. 
Makovich, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Consider tiny Seguin in south central Texas, where Constellation Energy Group 
Inc. of Baltimore is building an 800-megawatt gas-powered plant in a former 
cornfield. Fifteen miles to the west, Texas Independent Energy LP of Dallas 
recently finished a 1,000-megawatt plant. About the same distance to the 
north, American National Power, a Houston-based unit of Britain's 
International Power PLC, is building a 1,100-megawatt plant.
If generators don't get cold feet, Texas is on track to have a capacity 
surplus of 9% this summer and 11% by summer 2002, says Cambridge Energy 
Research Associates. That's in addition to the 15% surplus that most experts 
consider an adequate cushion. Some areas of the country, including parts of 
the Southeast, Upper Midwest, New York City and the West, are struggling with 
razor-thin capacity margins. After factoring in a similar 15% cushion, the 
West has an 8% capacity deficit and the Upper Midwest has a 4% deficit.
As a result, while electricity futures prices for summer are running at as 
much as $400 per megawatt hour in the Northwest and around $100 in the 
Northeast, Texas futures prices are averaging only $72 to $74 per megawatt 
hour.
Calpine Corp. of San Jose, Calif., is making the boldest wager that 
overcapacity and a lack of export possibilities won't sink Texas's wholesale 
electricity prices. The company has six plants under construction in the 
state, two of which are expected to come on line next month. And it plans to 
add an additional five plants over the next two years. Altogether, Calpine 
plans to spend about $2.8 billion in the state, its largest investment 
outside California.
"People from day one probably thought Calpine was crazy," says Darrell 
Hayslip, a company vice president. "But so far, we are absolutely convinced 
that this is the right bet." He says Calpine's newer gas-fired plants are 40% 
more efficient than older plants in the state, a third of which are at least 
30 years old. Calpine expects that edge to force rivals to retire older 
plants, thus keeping electricity prices from sagging.
Duke's Doubts
Others aren't so sure. After initially planning new plants in Texas, Duke 
Energy Corp. began to worry that the state was getting overbuilt. Last May, 
Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., sold its 80% stake in a plant under construction in 
south Texas to Calpine. "We sized up the market early, and then realized too 
many followers were doing the same thing," says Jim Donnell, president and 
CEO of Duke Energy North America.
If the electricity situation outside Texas grows too grim and too much supply 
sinks prices in the state, there could be "renewed pressure" for Texas to 
study interconnection options, says John Stauffacher, vice president for 
regulatory affairs at Houston-based Dynegy Inc., which has 1,000 megawatts of 
capacity in Texas.
Calpine, for one, wouldn't mind sharing Texas power with the East and West. 
"I would love to be able to wheel power from Texas to California," says Mr. 
Hayslip. But, so far, the Texas utilities haven't budged in their opposition 
to exports.
A few generators are trying to find the best of both worlds. Tenaska Inc. of 
Omaha, Neb., is building plants at the border between the Texas and eastern 
grids. Though utilities aren't allowed to be connected to both grids at once, 
the plants are designed to allow the company to switch between grids as 
demand and prices warrant.
In rural Grimes County, about 90 miles outside Houston, Tenaska plant manager 
Frank Carelli boasts that his 830-megawatt plant could disconnect from one 
grid, connect to the other and be back at full power within an hour. A 
similar Tenaska plant is slated to begin operations this month in Rusk 
County, near the Louisiana border.

The map listed in the blow message is NOT the
first pass of CSC ZONES.  It IS the study regions
and associated numbers we used in our anaysis.
You will need this map to help use the other
files.  CSC Zones will be developed with
stackholder input and calcualtion of shift
factors.  Sorry for the miscommunication.  Thanks

Doug,

I had two very positive meetings this evening  with Tom Martin and Jim 
Schwieger.  They are looking for a Carthage Hub physical trader.  Tom is 
planning on talking I think to Lavorato to discuss the details.  

It's interesting because with the HPL sale now their physical guys are moving 
into an environment where they don't have an asset to trade around and have 
to be flat daily.  Gee, I wonder what that's like?  Given ERCOT liquidity and 
vol I had to chuckle on the inside (welcome to the real world).  

I really appreciate your support during all of this.  Some bosses could 
consider a situation like this a slight against them and bear out their 
resentment personally or to others to stymie that person's movement.  You 
have been nothing but a class act in that regard, and although I indeed would 
have liked a look at the ST-ERCOT book, I don't hold that against you.  In 
fact I don't even hold it against management.  It's no different than 
trading.  Just because someone smart is selling it doesn't mean it won't get 
bid up and run through them.  I am confident that wherever I end up I will be 
successful -- no different than any other time in my life.  I don't know 
another way.  The one time that I had some short-term hardship last year, you 
and I agree that I was sold too early, and that too will become 
self-evident.  

As I stated yesterday, the end of this week looks to be the time frame where 
I will make my a final decision.

Thanks for all of you runderstanding,

Larry

Doug,

Doesn't look like we're going to be able to do anything with this for right
now.  The demand for chemicals has made it necessary to guarantee
production.

Let me know if anything else comes up.

  Steve,

  As we discussed, here are my indicative numbers for a $100
daily call for
  the winter and for march and april:

  J/F  $5.00 MWh
  M/A  $4.00 MWh

  These would be for a firm product. I was thinking that if we
could work on
  the structure alittle we could change that to UD with
intraday flexibility.

  Please call me to discuss when you get a chance,

  Take care,

  Doug

In a memo from Parvis Adib dated Oct. 31 (copy attached), the PUC describes
a serious concern on the part of the Commission regarding market abuse
through relieving Local Congestion under the current Protocols. John Meyer
has asked me to draft a suggested solution to this concern. I am
recommending the following solution and believe it should be very easy to
implement.

THE PROBLEM: Gaming whereby an entity deliberately and chronically places
itself in a situation to create local congestion in order to profit from
instructions to decrement its energy deliveries.

The current language states that when a resource  is instructed to
decrement its energy deliveries and a Market Solution does not exist the
resource's QSE will pay the minimum of the MCPE for that zone or 0. The
trouble with this approach is that if the MCPE is negative the QSE is
rewarded for having a resource causing local congestion. If the situation
persisted over time this could encourage inefficient generation to be built
on the same area so that it can profit by having its output reduced or even
turned off.

Note that this would only happen in a situation where the local congestion
is located within a zone that is also susceptible to CSC congestion as well
and the QSEs in such a zone are decremented most of the time which leads to
high incidence of negative MCPE for the zone. This does not appear likely
but could occur if a zone is relatively small; i.e., dominated by QSEs that
are few in number and that consistently overschedule across a CSC zone with
the anticipation that they will always be instructed to decrement energy in
real time.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION :

Do not compensate or charge a resource that is instructed to decrement its
energy deliveries by ERCOT when a Market Solution does not exist in
relieving local congestion.  However, the resource must obey the
instruction in order to maintain system reliability.

Please give me your comments on this solution concept  before Dec. 1. I  am
recommending that we add this as an item to vote on at the RUG meeting
scheduled for Dec. 6. I will also draft the recommended language changes
(very minor) to sections 6 and 7 and distribute it prior to the meeting.

Manny

Regarding the response to question no. 2:

In my reading and understanding of the Protocols, the only requirement for
the submission by QSEs of monotonically increasing ordered pair bids is for
balancing energy service bids.  This requirement does not appear to apply to
the submission of AS capacity bids by QSEs, although the selection process
does require the stacking of all bids in a monotonically increasing fashion.


Also, my understanding is that "monotonically increasing ordered pairs" does
not necessarily mean a linear function, i.e., there does not have to be a
"straight-line" relationship between all QSE bids.

Subject: Examples in Response to Staff Request in Project No. 23220




OWG members,

Jerry Ward has prepared the following set of responses to the request of the
Commission Staff for several examples of the operation and clearing of
Ancillary
Services markets.  The Staff has asked that the examples be provided prior
to
the next Technical Conference scheduled for January 19.

As chair of the Operations Workgroup, I had asked Jerry to develop the first
draft of responses so that each of you could then review and provide
comments
upon them.  Comments should be provided by the close of business on Monday,
January 16th.  All comments should be copied to the full workgroup by
e-mailing
them to operations@ercot.com.  Jerry and I will then incorporated the
comments,
as appropriate, into the examples and communicate to the workgroup the final
version of the examples prior to sending them to the Staff on the 17th.

(See attached file: 23220 Examples.doc)

Thanks -- Brad

Is Clayton reading it correctly?  I must admit that I am having trouble
interpreting the proposed solution as well.  Also, I would respectfully
disagree that the problem (i.e., potential for gaming) exists only when the
zonal MCPE is negative.

Subject: QSE project manager conference call on 12/13/2000


This is to invite you to the first QSE project
manager conference call. The QSE project manager
conference calls will be held on a bi-weekly basis
to provide a new forum for more timely discussion
of issues related to market readiness activities
for QSEs. This e-mail is being sent to all QSE
project managers and attendees of the QSE project
manager kick-off meeting on November 15, 2000 in
Austin.

The following is a draft agenda. Please e-mail any
suggested agenda items and I will e-mail a revised
agenda to all of you next week.

1. Conference call format, frequency, and time
etc.
2. Follow up on action items from Nov. 15th
meeting
3. Registration / Qualification update
4. Testing update (Ancillary services, RTU, ICCP,
Private Network)
5. Formation of task force for API/XML
6. Mock Market update
7. Questions and answers

Details of the conference call:

Date: Wednesday 12/13/2000
Time: 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. central time
Call in number: 1-800-291-0540
Participant Code: 186878

If your organization will have multiple attendees
to the conference call, ERCOT would appreciate
your cooperation in limiting the number of lines
into the conference call by sharing one speaker
phone from each entity. This will help manage
simultaneous conversations as well as costs of the
conference call.

Please put your phone on mute for the duration of
the conference call except when you are speaking.
If you do not have a mute button on your phone,
you may press *6(star 6) on your phone for mute
mode and press *6 again to un-mute the line. If
you are close to a personal computer during the
conference call, you will have the option to send
questions via e-mail to ClientRelations@ercot.com
during the conference call if you are unable to
ask your question verbally due to the voice
traffic. Your questions will be printed and
addressed during the Q&A session of the conference
call or logged for follow up in the next meeting.

Housekeeping:

Dial the assigned phone number 3-5 minutes prior
to the scheduled conference start time

Listen carefully to the recorded operator
instructions.

Have the assigned Participant Code at hand for
easy entry at the prompt.

Please do not put your phone on hold during the
conference call. This may introduce your company's
call waiting music or announcement to the
conference call.

A roll call of the attendees will be done at the
beginning of the conference call and at the end of
the first hour only.

You may press *0 anytime for conference call
operator assistance.

We look forward to your participation.

Thanks to all of those who participated in this week's Operating Guides
review workshop.  If you put your name on the sign-in list, you've been
added to a new ERCOT e-mail distribution list. (Check below)  All future
notices concerning the NEW Operating Guides will be sent to this Operating
Guides list (ogr@ercot.com)  If you would like to be included, please
contact Kurt at ERCOT.

There will be a 2-day workshop to discuss comments on the next version of
the NEW Operating Guides on January 24-25 at the Holiday Inn - South in
Austin.  On Wednesday we'll run from 9:30 to 5:00 and Thursday from 8:30 to
4:00.  I intend to start by reviewing Emergency Operations (new Part 4),
then Parts 2 (ERCOT Operations) and 3 (Interface Operations / QSE and
TDSP).  We will then move through the Appendices, in order, and go back and
pick up Part 1 (Introduction) last.

Any comments you would like to have considered for inclusion in the next
version may be forwarded to Bob Brodie at rbrodie@kemaconsulting.com


Additionally, I have attached the presentation I made at today's TAC
meeting.

February 16, 2001
Public Utility Commission of Texas
Sent via email

Commissioners,

         Once again, I thank you for the courtesy of including me in
yesterday's PUCT workshop on the ERCOT protocols.  It has been my
experience that such open discussion of market design issues, with full
pursuit of any problematic features, is essential in achieving a successful
electricity market.  Unfortunately, the subject is complex and the details
matter.  It is not possible to anticipate every problem, but the evidence
shows that ignoring obvious problems in the hope that the rules can be
easily adapted has not been a successful strategy.  This makes what you are
doing all the more important.

         On reflection after the workshop, I am more concerned about the
argument that emerged about the role of the ISO.  In many instances, to
explain away problems of the type identified by Shmuel Oren, an argument
was made that some administrative rule along with discretionary choices of
the ISO would counteract perverse incentives created by the pricing
system.  If this argument were correct, it would seem to place a
substantial burden on the ISO to undo what the pricing incentives have
done.  When faced with such conditions in California and elsewhere, the ISO
developed a more and more intrusive role in what became less and less of a
market.  To make this unhappy practice part of the official design, to the
point that the ISO is expected to ignore the information in schedules and
do what is right, would seem to be especially problematic.  At a minimum,
it would make the ISO responsible for any difficulties that develop,
without giving the ISO the market tools to avoid the problems.

         Commissioner Wood asked at what point how a coordinated spot
market would differ from the ERCOT protocols.  We pursued the most
important feature--eliminating the balanced schedule requirement--but did
not have time to pursue all the other details.  The presentation I handed
out contains a summary of the key features on page 20.  After the workshop,
I received an email with a recent presentation by John Chandley, a
colleague of mine, that addresses the issues of market design with a focus
on California.  As I indicated in Austin, there are important differences
between ERCOT and California, but on the matter of wholesale market design
there is a great deal in common, such as requiring balanced schedules,
relying on congestion zones, applying different treatment for different
kinds of congestion, using ad hoc pricing rules, and so on.  John's summary
of the recommended reforms for California would apply in large part to the
ERCOT protocols.  I have attached a copy of this presentation for your
information.

         I remain both impressed with all that you have accomplished to
date, and worried that fundamental assumptions in the market design will
recreate problems that we have seen elsewhere.  My recommendation to adopt
a coordinated spot market more like PJM won't solve all problems, but it
would go a long way.  Whatever the difficulty now, it will be much harder
to fix these problems later.  Furthermore, the coordinated spot market role
for the ISO is much more robust.  If the simplifying assumptions of the
ERCOT protocols are true (which I doubt), the coordinated spot market will
end up looking much like the zonal model with a few constraints and easy
bilateral trading.  But if the ERCOT assumptions are wrong, the ERCOT
protocols will face serious problems and the coordinated spot market would
be a solution.  Furthermore, we now know from experience that the
coordinated spot market is neither more complicated nor more expensive than
the alternatives.  The sooner you make a commitment in Texas to adopt this
successful market design, the better.

         I offer these further remarks as I did my comments yesterday, in
the hope that you succeed.  I would be happy to discuss these matters
further, as you decide.

Best Regards,

William W. Hogan

p.s.  I do not have the mailing list for the workshop participants, but I

can forward to the participant list.

I just sent this to Lloyd.  Appreciate your confidence on the matter...as you 
can see not everybody is onside with things.  Unbalanced schedules go hand in 
hand with LMP - logically we won't/can't get unbalanced schedules in ERCOT 
without admitting we favor LMP for dispatch.  We can and will minimize this 
point during the discussion about balanced/unbalanced schedules but 
eventually one leads to the other.  Anyway the way in which LMP uses price 
signals to clear congestion is in our commercial interests.

 I really don't understand what is going on...how can this possibly be just a 
case of not understanding how things work?

 Yesterday I was at a meeting of the Protocol Review Committee in ERCOT.  At 
lunch, Brad Jones from TXU approached me with some shock and surprise.  
Apparently there is a fairly strong rumor going around that Enron has 
retrenched back to the no "pool" zonal model, that I have been completely 
marginalized, and that Robin Kittel resigned in response to this reversal.  I 
assured him that this was not the case.  Then I receive a note from Bill 
Hogan this morning (see below) which indicates what Rick Shapiro is saying 
publically.  I know that I am prone to overreacting, but I don't see how his 
statements help our efforts in ERCOT or SPP (or Florida for that matter) all 
they do is allow other market participants to think we (I?) don't know what 
is going on.  Why couldn't Rick have simply said that, as a general rule, for 
the real time aspects of the market, we favor PJM?  He could have indicated 
that we think there are problems with the FTRs, ancillary services and the 
scale/scope of the RTO but for real time dispatch we think PJM has some real 
benefits.  This would have been consistent with what we have been saying in 
ERCOT and SPP - and what we will eventually have to say in the Alliance if we 
are to be successful in changing that RTO.  Lloyd I really don't know what 
else I can do...

Regards, Ron


Ron,

         I was on a panel yesterday with Rick Shapiro at an AEI Conference 
in DC.  In response to a question about Enron's position regarding  PJM 
type models, he said that there had been a filing in Texas which might have 
created the impression Enron was now in support of a PJM 
approach.  However, he said, it was more complicated than that, and in any 
event that Enron had "withdrawn the filing in Texas."

         Has the filing been withdrawn?  What happened here?

Bill

Subject: Kevin's RTO Ideas for East

TJ-Please forward to all of Kevin's trading group.  Thanks.
_____________

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy 
buses."

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.

Controllable Infrastructure will be billed for 2001 as follows:

Long Distance -  Will be billed to cost centers directly on account 52502000 
and will consist of actual charges for long distance from your phone, calling 
cards, and calls to the 1-800-97-ENRON number.

Market Data - Will also be billed to cost centers directly on account 
52502000 and will consist of actual charges for market data obtained through 
the providers (Bloomberg, Reuters, etc)

WAN Links -  Wide-Area Network links are used to connect remote offices to 
the Houston network.  These charges will be billed on actuals and directly to 
the cost center.

Trading Turrets -  Special Phones used by the traders.  This will be billed 
on plan.


The following items are part of infrastructure, but the costs are driven by 
system development projects.  These items will be billed according to plan, 
which was derived from analyzing your expected system development costs.  As 
the year progresses we will examine your system development charges to 
determine if the portion of the infrastructure charges you are receiving 
should be adjusted.


Application Integration -  Whenever a new client level or web-based 
application is employed or an existing system is upgraded the application 
integration team ensures this system is compatible with other systems and 
will not cause system failures or downtime.

Change Management -  This group works with the development teams to provide 
scheduling and contingency plans for bringing new systems online and for 
maintenance on existing systems.  This includes scheduling downtimes and 
providing the expected impact on the company.

Architecture and Planning - The primary function of the Architecture group is 
to provide overall design and integration of technologies and products for 
Enron's network.  This includes ensuring server space for scalability and 
security is in place for the network.


If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Mike,

1.  Please see attached spreadsheet.
2.  Ditto.
3.  Attached spreadsheets have some info.  I am working on more detail for 
you.
4.  I am seeking response from TPS engineering.
5.  I am seeking additional info from TPS environmental.
6.  See spreadsheets.  No duct firing.

- Frank

P.S.  On the Heat Rate Spreadsheet, look@ the 2x1 and 1x1 tabs (it is a work 
in progress).

What about the 'operational tools' you referred to that you may have on the 
shelf and can provide to me?


>>> "Curry, Mike" <Mike.Curry@ENRON.com> 04/11/01 01:54PM >>>
Frank, here is the list of operational info that I think would be
helpful to our team:

1) Ramp Rates for plant (ramp up and down)
 - zero to 139 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 140 to 230 MW
 - 231 to 280 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 281 to 460 MW

2) Heat Rate Curves
 - vs. output
 - vs. Temp. / Rel. Humidity

3) Start charge (in MMBtu) -  please define each, i.e. cold start means
plant has been down x hours
 - cold start
 - warm start
 - hot start

4) Is there a maximum number of starts per year?

5) Is there any permit limitations other than below?
 - In 1x1 must operate only between 140 MW and 230MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - In 2x1 must operate only between 280 MW and 460MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - Annual limit on run time or tons of emission?
 - What is a violation, is it any deviation or must the deviation
occur for a min. amount of time?

6) Operational limits
 - In 1x1 operates between 140 MW and 230MW approx.
 - In 2x1 operates between 280 MW and 460MW approx.
 - Any other level that can be operated?  Any duct firing?

Thanks for your assistance with these, - Mike

Process for Identifying
Commercially Significant Constraints (CSCs)

1. The ERCOT Engineering Subcommittee (ESC) Steady
State Task Force (SSTF) will complete preparing
the Summer 2001 On Peak base case around December
1, 2000.

2. Using that base case, ERCOT System Planning
will conduct an analysis of the base case
identifying transmission constraints and possible
congestion zones.  The performance criteria used
in evaluating the system will be the ERCOT
Planning Criteria.  These results will be provided
for stakeholder/market entity review and input in
January.

3. Based upon this input, ERCOT will develop a
recommendation and present to the TAC the
identified transmission constraints and related
CSC zones in early February.

4. Once CSC's are identified, shift factors will
be calculated on each transmission constraint
relating to each CSC.  These will be provided to a
stakeholder working group for development of
average shift factors for use in applying
congestion management to the market transactions.

-------------------------------------------------

ERCOT System Planning is preparing calculations
and data to support the identification of
Commercially Significant Constraints (CSC).  This
work will be posted on the Internet very soon for
stakeholder review and input.  A meeting to
discuss these calculations with stakeholders will
be held:

Wednesday, January 31
9:30 AM to 3:30 PM
Red Lion Hotel in Austin (I35 & 290)

The goal of this meeting is to identify which
transmission system contingencies and limiting
elements are commercially significant.  After
CSC's are determined at this meeting, ERCOT will
develop a recommendation and present it to TAC at
their February 7 meeting.

We have also set up an email account to receive
comments.  Its email address is
csccomments@ercot.com  It will be available
throughout this process to receive comments and
input.

Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

There is a new version of Stack Manager which is being released this evening, 
for use on Monday morning.

Changes

1) "Inactivate Suspended Children" - New menu item available by 
right-clicking on a Parent Product. It will change all Child Products of the 
highlighted parent from "Suspended" to "Inactive". Note that this will be 
applied only to the product which you highlight. It will also show available 
when highlighting Products which are not Parents, but it will have no effect.

2) The transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those 
transactions completed on the calendar day (problem has affected Australia 
and Singapore).

3) A Constant Spread which is changed from the front page of the Stack 
Manager will stay as changed for that Product. The spread will persist even 
if transactions occur.


Background

Suspended Child Products continue to have their prices updated as the price 
of the Parent changes. Inactive Child Products do not have their prices 
updated. The price update process slows down EnronOnline processing and Stack 
Manager response, so it is advantageous to ensure all non-active Products are 
in an Inactive state. 

If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline call 
center at:

North America: 713 853 4357 (HELP)
Asia and Australia: +61 2 9229 2300

After corresponding with various members of the OWG, PIWG, ISONP, and
ERCOT,  Reliant would like to propose the following change to compensation
for relieving local congestion:

When a resource is instructed to reduce its scheduled deliveries in order
to help relieve local Congestion and a Market Solution does not exist, the
compensation mechanism will always result in a zero sums gain to the QSE
for that instruction to the resource.  Basically, whatever the QSE is
charged or credited due to resource imbalance due to such an instruction
will be offset by the OOME payment so that the net effect is always zero.

The recommended language changes to section 6.8.2.2 are attached.

Doug, 

This is a recap of my understanding of our damages calculation in the Calpine 
matter:

For the year 2000, EPMI relied primarily on the contract with Oxychem to 
fulfill its obligations to LCRA.  EPMI paid $1 per kilowatt month for a total 
of $1.2 million for capacity under the Oxychem deal.

In addition, we had costs and expenses to supply energy to LCRA when it 
exercised its option. [Doug, I need to revisit our calculation here to make 
sure I understand it. Ed, this is information that I will need to supplement 
for you.]  We also paid liquidated damages on, as you recall, two occasions, 
when we could not physically supply power.  I received documentation from 
Mike Curry that shows LDs of $55,821.50 for 5/12/2000. We are attempting to 
locate documentation of the other day for which we had to pay LDs, but you 
believe it would have been a similar amount.  We also discussed the issue of 
additional damages caused by LCRA's ability to select an 8 hour peaking 
option rather than a full 16 hour on peak day.  EPMI would generally need to 
purchase a full 16 hour piece in order to fulfill LCRA's 8 hour peaking 
option.  EPMI could then attempt to sell the extra 8 hours, but could only do 
so on the spot market and typically at a substantial discount over what EPMI 
could have sold the full 16 hour piece.  The process of pulling documentation 
to show what we used to fulfill the days when LCRA selected the peaking 
option, and what part of the remainder of that piece we were able to resell 
(and at what price) is a very labor intensive process, which we currently 
have underway. You estimate that this "scaler" issue resulted in 
approximately $250,000.00 additional damages, which we will confirm as we are 
able to locate the documentation.  Your estimate of total damages related to 
the year 2000 is $1 to 1.5 million.  [I need to clarify whether this is in 
addition to the $1.2 million capacity charge.]

For the year 2001, we are primarily relying on the Frontera contract.  We 
paid Frontera $6.2 million for the year.  We do not know how much of the $6.2 
million we will be able to recoup from sales to LCRA and others, because we 
do not know with certainty what the price of natural gas will be and how many 
days LCRA will exercise either the daily 16 hour option or the 8 hour peaking 
option.  Thus, we can, at best, estimate what our total costs will be for 
2001.  Thus far into the year, LCRA has only exercised its option a handful 
of times.  Your approximation was 5 times.  This results in minimal recovery 
based on sales to LCRA.  When LCRA has chosen not to exercise its option we 
have gone into the spot market to sell the power.  Our records indicate that 
we have sold the Frontera piece, when we could, and have recovered a total of 
$515,084 from 1/1/2001 through 4/18/2001.  ( This is from a schedule provided 
by Eric Saibi.) For the remainder of April 2001, we can estimate perhaps  an 
additional $129,408.  (I arrived at this figure by taking the average profit 
per mwh for the 1st half of April and applying it to the last 8 week days of 
the month).

Assuming that LCRA will exercise its option for most of the months of May, 
June, July and August 2001, we can arrive at an estimated recovery as 
follows:  Taking an average natural gas price of $5.00, our variable costs 
for purchase of energy from Frontera will be $41.29 per mwh, and our variable 
costs for sales to LCRA will be $56.70; thus, we will recover approximately 
$15.41 per mwh sold to LCRA.

There are 89 weekdays from May 1 through August 31.  LCRA is expected to 
purchase full 16 hour days at times and choose only the peaking option at 
times (8 hours).  We can blend this amount to average 12 hour days.  $15.41 x 
100 mw x 12 hours x 89 days = $1, 645,788.  We may be able to sell the 
remaining half days when LCRA selects the peaking option on the spot market 
at a reduced price.  If we are able to sell these 8 hour blocks at an average 
profit of $5.00 per mwh, we will recover an additional $178,000.  We may 
occasionally  be able to sell weekend hours during the summer months. Again 
assuming an average of $5.00 profit per mwh, we might recover an additional 
$272,000 ($5.00 x 100 mw x 16 hours x 34 days).  

We expect that LCRA will not exercise its option as often during the months 
of September through December.  Using similar modelling, we can expect to 
recover perhaps an additional $750,000 to $1 million for the remainder of the 
year.  

Using these estimates we anticipate that we will recover approximately $3.75 
million of our expenditure of $6.2 million, for a total loss of approximately 
$2.45 million for the year 2001.  Because of the imprecision of our ability 
to estimate future variables, we should call this estimated damages of $2 to 
2.5 million.

I understand that we do not have our cover for 2002 finalized, but that we 
can expect losses similar to 2001, although perhaps a little lower.  For 
purposes of estimation at this point, we would forecast a loss of $ 1.5 to 2 
million for 2002.

Doug, Please review this damages discussion at soon as you can, and then call 
me with any clarifications.  Thanks.

OWG members,

Jerry Ward has prepared the following set of responses to the request of the
Commission Staff for several examples of the operation and clearing of 
Ancillary
Services markets.  The Staff has asked that the examples be provided prior to

accompanying comments.  You'll be interested in the following sections.  Let 
me know your thoughts.

Comments:

See last section dealing w/ (1) running voluntary certificates through REC 
program; (2) not adding unnecessary market complexity; (3) impact of 
voluntary credits could have on REC program; (4) customer education re: 
difference between green & renewable 

You might also look over the definition section of the redline.

Please let know your comments by 1 p.m.  Comments have to be filed at 3 p.m.  
Call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Team:

Here's a list of things that I came up with that I believe we need to 
prioritize and act on.  I'd like to discuss it with you during our meeting on 
Friday.  Please think about it this week and let me know what I've forgotten 
- or any other ideas you might have.  I've also attached the beginnings (very 
rough - needs a LOT of work still) of a business plan.  Please review it and 
let me know what you think.  Here's the list:

1.  Finish business plan - what are our goals?  How do we achieve them most 
efficiently? etc.
2.  Review current coverage strategy, i.e. who are we calling, how often, 
what have results been, etc.
3.  Determine exactly who our key targets should be (most likely industrial 
in my opinion).
4.  Get our marketing materials in order:
 a.  QSE pitchbook; and
 b.  Enron/Risk management pitchbook.
5.  Conduct marketing seminars (if it seems like a good idea and we think it 
will bear fruit):
 a.  list of invitees;
 b.  agenda; and
 c.  organization, i.e. who speaks, where, how many , etc.
6.  Manage current deals - i.e. how often should we have group meetings? is 
our current hot list accurate? what do we have on the horizon? etc.
7.  Recruit analyst (assoc?).
8.  Recruit mid-marketer.
9.  Establish and maintain liaze with services desk.
10.  Coordinate with financial products group.



Thanks for you help folks.

Somewhat regretfully, I have decided to resign from ENE.  I have taken a 
position with Raintree Capital located in Houston.  My first day should be 
Wednesday, April 25.  While I have thoroughly enjoyed my nearly three years 
at ENE, the opportunity at Raintree is directly in line with my long term 
professional goals and was an opportunity I could not pass up.  I enjoyed 
working with (or the interaction with) each of you and look forward to 
meeting again in the future.  Please make a note of my new contact 
information and do not hesitate to give me a call.

Staff distributed another list of ten questions to those who attended
today's pre-hearing conference at the PUC regarding Docket No. 23220 (ERCOT
Protocols).  A copy is attached for your information that includes a
question related to confidential documents filed by ERCOT.  ERCOT did not
object to sharing this question with you.

You may remember that an early commitment was made on behalf of ERCOT to
file written answers to question numbers 2 through 5 of Staff's first list
of ten questions.  (You got that list as an attachment to my earlier e-mail
on January 4, 2001.)   Today, we also requested that written answers to be
filed by ERCOT on January 17 to cover question numbers 3 & 4 in this
attachment.   In addition, a draft copy of a paper by Dr. Shams Siddiqi,
"ERCOT Local Congestion Management: Potential for Market Abuse," was
distributed today to facilitate related discussion on January 19.
Unfortunately, I do not have an electronic copy of that paper to share with
you.

See you on January 19 Technical Conference.

Ken,

Thanks for the opportunity to review the initial studies performed by the 
ERCOT
System Planning Technical Operations group and to have the opportunity to
comment on them at the January 31, 2001 CSC meeting.

After I began reviewing the reports that you sent out, I noticed the need for
the following items to be addressed quickly in order for all market 
participants
(including ERCOT) to perform meaningful transmission studies:

1)  A listing of single element contingencies that PSS/E and/or MUST performs
that aren't valid (phantom) contingencies from a physical perspective (i.e. 
the
protection schemes in place would not allow this issue to occur anyway).  The
easiest to explain example of this situation is when parallel step up
transformers are used at a power plant.  When one transformer is outaged by
automatic single element contingency functions of PSS/E or MUST, the remaining
transformer is reported to experience massive overloads that aren't really
relevant since the protection scheme in place wouldn't allow this to 
physically
occur.  While step up transformers of this nature can easily be screened from
the output of PSS/E and MUST, other phantom contingencies that are reported on
transmission line outages can't be.  This listing of phantom contingencies
should be developed and stored in such a fashion that allows it to be included
in PSS/E and/or MUST runs as an exception file of contingencies to be ignored.
A separate file should be maintained and posted on the ERCOT website for each 
of
the dataset A & B cases that are prepared annually.

2)  A listing by load flow bus number of all special contingencies that should
be included in PSS/E and/or MUST simulations to reflect the actual response of
protection schemes in place needs to be provided by the TPs.  A simple example
of a special contingency from a PSS/E and/or MUST stand point that is really a
single contingency from a physical system stand point is when an 
autotransformer
is connected to the line side of a breaker in a station, rather than to the
station bus.  PSS/E and MUST needs to be instructed to remove both components 
at
the same time in order to accurately simulate what is really a single
contingency from a physical perspective.  A separate file should be maintained
and posted on the ERCOT website for each of the dataset A & B cases that are
prepared annually.

3)  A listing by load flow bus number of all double circuit lines that are
greater than 0.5 miles in length needs to be provided by the TPs.  This 
listing
is needed by market participants to simulate ATC during severe weather
situations and for evaluating planned transmission additions using PSS/E 
and/or
MUST.  A separate file should be maintained and posted on the ERCOT website 
for
each of the dataset A & B cases that are prepared annually.

4)  A listing of valid operator actions that will be taken to alleviate post
contingency overloads should be provided by the TPs in a format that is
compatible with PSS/E and/or MUST.  A separate file should be maintained and
posted on the ERCOT website for each of the dataset A & B cases that are
prepared annually.


In addition, the following requested information would better allow all market
participants to understand the planned expansion and operation of the ERCOT
transmission system:

1)  Prepare an annual transmission plan document that is posted on the ERCOT
website which graphically and verbally illustrates the following aspects of
proposed projects: location, electrical connectivity (i.e. one-line
representation), estimated cost, anticipated system benefits, and proposed
in-service date.  The projects proposed and described in this expansion plan
document should be of the same scope and timing as the ones modeled in the 
SSTF
dataset A & B cases.  Ideally, this document would be posted annually on the
website at the same time as the dataset A & B cases.  The California ISO
currently provides this information on their website at the following address:
http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/transassessments/.

2)  Prepare an annual document that will be posted on the ERCOT website, which
explains how the commercially significant constraints (CSCs) will be handled
(i.e. preventative generation redispatch or post contingency operator action 
to
reconfigure the transmission system through opening or closing breakers).


To the degree that is possible, please include these issues in your agenda for
discussion at the January 31, 2001 CSC meeting.  Thanks

ERCOT System Planning has prepared calculations
and data to support the identification of
Commercially Significant Constraints (CSC). A
meeting to discuss these calculations with
stakeholders will be held:

 Wednesday, January 31
 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM
 Red Lion Hotel in Austin (I35 & 290)

The goal of this meeting is to identify which
transmission system contingencies and limiting
elements are commercially significant.  After
CSC's are determined at this meeting, ERCOT will
develop a recommendation and present it to TAC at
their February 7 meeting.

We have also set up an email account to receive
comments.  Its email address is

 csccomments@ercot.com

it will be available throughout this process to
receive comments and input.

The actual mwh growth from Q12000 to Q1 2001 was 3.56% (59,426,845 mwh to 
61,543,268 mwh).  Through my calculations, which I will describe below, I 
arrived at a weather-normalized growth of 4.28% (59,114,067 mwh to 61,646,157 
mwh).  While I would not say that load growth exactly matches my figure, I 
feel confident that load growth in ERCOT was in the range of 3.5% to 4%, year 
over year.

Methodology

To arrive at the 2000 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/97 through 12/31/99) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2000.  I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2000 loads.  The 
amount of data I used to estimate the ERCOT model in this example is standard 
for each of the load forecasting models I have developed (when that amount of 
data is available). 

To arrive at the 2001 typical loads, I estimated the model using two and one 
half years of data (7/1/98 through 12/31/00) and inserted typical ERCOT 
weather for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2001.   I used the 
resulting loads in my analysis for typical first quarter 2001 loads.

I then compared the results, which I have summarized above.

Let me know if you have any questions.

CC list suppressed...

Compassionate Competition?

(Utility Spotlight) Maybe it's the new tenant in the White
House. Or maybe it's just the natural rivalry between
Republican pork rinds and Democrat brie and Chablis.

At any rate, around mid-January I found my email box
stuffed with "pushed" press releases touting the Texas
solution to utility restructuring. According to the
clippings, the Lone Star State has at last created a
regional power market that will actually work-and with no
help from California.

One such clipping is a new consultant's study commissioned
by the Association of Electric Companies of Texas. It
checks off all the mistakes that California made, one by
one, and then purports to show how the Texas model sets
things right. "This study provides an effective analysis
of the course Texas has followed on the road to
competition versus how it was done in California," said
John Fainter, president of the AECT. "It provides
compelling evidence that Texas is on track to achieve
significant benefits from competition."

But as I see it, the Texas law (Senate Bill 7, the Texas
Electric Choice Act, signed in 1999 by then-Gov. George W.
Bush) contains the same basic failing as did Assembly Bill
1890, the California law-it creates a tariff structure for
Texas that will surely run aground if electricity prices
don't behave as expected. Just like California, the Texas
law creates a rate freeze keyed to revenue levels set
under the old regulated regime, and then mandates a
guaranteed rate cut on top of that for residential and
small commercial customers (6 percent in Texas, instead of
10 percent, as in California), good until Jan. 1, 2007
(both with adjustments allowed for fuel cost increases).

So if power prices in Texas should spike out of control
between now and 2007, more than warranted by fuel costs,
you could have the same mess as in California-utilities
buying high and selling low.

Yet the Texas model does lack one drawback. It doesn't
have FERC. That's because Texas enjoys its own private
power grid, the ERCOT ISO-formed by the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas-which operates entirely
within the state and thus stands largely exempt from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That gives Texas an
advantage-a state-regulated ISO, dedicated to state
interests.

"WE DON'T PERCEIVE ANY IMMEDIATE THREAT OF GENERATION
SHORTAGES." That's what I heard from Bill Bojorquez,
ERCOT's director of settlement, when I talked with him on
Jan. 12. ERCOT is generally seen as friendly to merchant
generation, and the PUC has already OK'd standards for
ERCOT for generation interconnection, to help create a
climate that encourages construction of new power plants.

Bojorquez calls ERCOT the nation's largest ISO in terms of
load (peak demand last summer of 57,600 MW), and tells how
it's doing things differently from other regions. For
instance, ERCOT will create no central power exchange or
auction market for wholesale power or ancillary services.
"We won't settle any markets," says Bojorquez. And ERCOT
will rely on socialized uplift charges to recover
congestion costs, beginning June 1, 2001, when pilot
programs start up in Texas for retail electric choice, and
continuing at least through 2003. It will not create a
scheme for tradable transmission congestion rights (TCRs)
unless congestion costs exceed $20 million in any 12-month
period. However, Bojorquez concedes that ERCOT is
"transitioning" to a new single control area, and is
building new control area facilities in Wheeler, Texas,
with a backup office in Austin. (That effort proved a
budget buster in California.)

And ERCOT offers another unique feature. As I learned from
two technology experts from Lodestar, which has signed
software deals with the ISO, ERCOT will perform all the
forecasting, load profiling, and customer aggregation, and
will initiate most of the required data transfers between
utilities, suppliers, and the scheduling coordinators,
known in Texas by the delightful acronym of QSE-pronounced
as "quesy"-which stands for "qualified scheduling entity."

According to Steve Doroff, Lodestar's senior vice
president of product development, and Jason Iacobucci,
product manager at the company, the Texas law barred
utilities from passing along to their ratepayers any new
cost incurred for any new services associated with retail
choice. That rule was enough, they said, to convince the
utilities to delegate all the ordinary marketing functions
to the ISO, including the development of data formatting
and communications protocols between suppliers, utilities,
and scheduling coordinators for customer enrollment and
load and revenue estimations, using electronic data
interchange (EDI) and XML software systems.

This feature has proved a godsend to the Texas market,
says Lodestar. It centralizes the myriad of data transfers
under the control of one player-with one software
network-instead of fragmenting the job among various
utilities, marketers and aggregators, and new players such
as the "meter data management agent," as in California.
That means Texas will be spared the trouble of having to
estimate and allocate the dollar cost of sales and
marketing functions between utilities and unregulated
retailers. That task has become a minefield for PUCs. (See
News Digest, Jan. 1, 2001, p. 8.)

Nevertheless the retailers, suppliers, and utilities are
free to develop their own software systems to interact
with ERCOT. "If the QSEs are smart, they won't take
ERCOT's word for it," Doroff told me. "They'll do their
own calculations."

"THIS SCENARIO MAY BE MORE PROBLEMATIC FOR TEXAS THAN
CALIFORNIA," says Mark Krebs, the outspoken attorney from
Laclede Gas.

Here Krebs was talking about generation siting, not ISO
market design. Yet his words show that Texas eventually
may face the same problems we saw last year in California.

Writing on Nov. 30, on behalf of the American Gas Cooling
Center, Krebs told Jim Linville, of the Texas Natural
Resources Conservation Commission, that the new draft
rules proposed in Texas in November 2000 governing air
emissions for distributed generation and small-scale
electric generation (comments taken until Feb. 5) might
spell trouble for the state. (See www.tnree.state.tx.us.)

Krebs criticizes the Texas policy of forcing all DG plants
statewide to comply with emissions rules designed for the
Houston/Galveston ozone nonattainment area, where many
cogeneration and DG units are planned.

"The potential impact," writes Krebs "would appear to be a
ban upon all DG (with the illusory exception of renewables
and fuel cells) on the ostensible grounds that, as stated
in the rule, 'increased use of small electric generating
units could undermine the emission reductions achieved
with recently permitted combined-cycle power plants.'"

Senate Bill 7 requires a 50 percent reduction for NOx
emissions and a 25 percent cut for SO2 for grandfathered
plants by May 2003. As ERCOT acknowledged in January 2000
in a study of generating plants in the Dallas/Ft. Worth
area, such rules may force power producers to take
generating plants out of service in the Dallas area. ERCOT
commented further in a report on potential electric system
constraints released Oct. 1:

"The DFW area could experience significant problems of
peak period supply adequacy and voltage stability if
significant amounts of the in-area generation become
unavailable and no new in-area plants are built. ... A
number of new merchant power plants are being planned or
built in North Texas, but all are outside the ... metro
area. Greenfield sites for new generation development are
limited and are likely to encounter public opposition."

I know Wiese has already talked to each of you about this, but I wanted to 
make sure both of you understand the REC situation for Green Mountain.  Using 
the current load profile, here is a summary of the annual mwhrs (and REC's) 
we are obligated to deliver to Green Mountain:




If the plant comes on line by 11/1/2001, and there is still a 75 MW 
transmission constraint, Enron Wind is contractually obligated to sell the 
following quantities in 2001:

 Nov-01  29,160
 Dec-01  27,396
 Total for 2001 56,556

If all transmission constraints are removed prior to 2002, the most Enron 
Wind is obligated to provide is 475,000 credits.  Therefore, we will 
definitely be short REC's in 2002.  The current pricing model assumes that we 
will only receive 360,000 REC's in 2002 (75 MW constraint exists for the 
entire year).  Any incremental REC's are purchased at $3.50 for both years.

Staff distributed another list of ten questions to those who attended
today's pre-hearing conference at the PUC regarding Docket No. 23220 (ERCOT
Protocols).  A copy is attached for your information that includes a
question related to confidential documents filed by ERCOT.  ERCOT did not
object to sharing this question with you.

You may remember that an early commitment was made on behalf of ERCOT to
file written answers to question numbers 2 through 5 of Staff's first list
of ten questions.  (You got that list as an attachment to my earlier e-mail
on January 4, 2001.)   Today, we also requested that written answers to be
filed by ERCOT on January 17 to cover question numbers 3 & 4 in this
attachment.   In addition, a draft copy of a paper by Dr. Shams Siddiqi,
"ERCOT Local Congestion Management: Potential for Market Abuse," was
distributed today to facilitate related discussion on January 19.
Unfortunately, I do not have an electronic copy of that paper to share with
you.

See you on January 19 Technical Conference.

Attached to this email is a report on the
Transmission Constraint Projects in MS Excel
format.

In addition, ERCOT System Planning Technical
Operations staff is currently examining and
preparing three project proposals for review by
ERCOT Stakeholders. These projects are:

Paris-Anna & Anna-NW Carrollton 345 kV Lines
Venus-Liggett 345 kV Line
San Miguel-Laredo-Bates-Edinburgh 345 kV Lines

We are planning on submitting these projects
separately for stakeholder review via TAC and the
ERCOT Board starting in March or April.

ERCOT is leading five regional planning groups
(North, South, Houston, West and Central) to
determine additional actions needed to resolve
transmission constraints.

We hope this information is helpful and your
cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

Pursuant to my assignment from the last RUG meeting and for consideration at
the next RUG meeting, attached is a redline of Section 6 to include language
to allow IDR-metered loads in NOIEs to have the right to participate through
their respective NOIEs in the Balancing Up Load bids (BUL).

To make the current revisions easy to spot, the attached document is
redlined version of Floyd Trefny's draft of Section 6 with the OWG revisions
from 11/14/01 with all changes accepted.

There are four changes:
(1) pg. 28 -- language to define BUL participation requirements by a
dynamically scheduling QSE.
(2) pg. 50 -- language to account for BUL participation by a dynamically
scheduling QSE in the uninstructed deviation calculation.
(3) pg. 78 -- language to recognize that NOIE BUL loads will not have an ESI
Id, and providing and alternative form of identification.
(4) pg. 86 -- language to account for BUL participation by a dynamically
scheduling QSE in the SCE calculation.

Changes (1), (2), and (4) apply only to dynamically schedulings QSEs with
BULs.  Change (3) applies to all NOIE BULs.

If I am reading this correctly, it appears that rather than provide an
adjustment for decremental units relieving local congestion, they will be
required to either pay the market clearing price of energy for the zone or
redispatch another unit in the same zone to counter act the decremental
instruction.

I believe we can support this change as long as few questions are properly
handled:

If there are multiple units that can clear the local congestion problem, who
gets selected?  (best shift factor, submitted dec bids, ERCOT flips a coin?)

If a generator fails to follow this instruction will it properly show up as
an uninstructed deviation, or will ERCOT follow performance to these direct
instructions some other way?

Can this similar methodology be used on the incremental side to curb abuse
by those who manipulate their resource plans to create congestion they will
be the only resource to correct?

Have a great day!

> In a memo from Parvis Adib dated Oct. 31 (copy attached), the PUC

> THE PROBLEM: Gaming whereby an entity deliberately and chronically places

>
> The current language states that when a resource  is instructed to

> persisted over time this could encourage inefficient generation to be
> built
> on the same area so that it can profit by having its output reduced or
> even
> turned off.
>
> Note that this would only happen in a situation where the local congestion

> the anticipation that they will always be instructed to decrement energy

> real time.
>
> RECOMMENDED SOLUTION :
>
> Do not compensate or charge a resource that is instructed to decrement its
