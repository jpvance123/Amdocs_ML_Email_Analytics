Louise,

I know you are appropriately focused on the Netco sale, yet I had Tammie place me on your calendar for 4:30 p.m. today.  I want to discuss my withdrawal as a potential employee of Netco and my desire to remain with the Enron estate.  Consistent with my ongoing concerns regarding the Chicago office, I also want to ensure those employees remain with that business to preserve value to the estate.  They have done an amazing job on behalf of the joint venture and PEC has voiced their desire that they are retained on PEC's behalf, no matter the counterparty.

I wanted you to know my direction even if your schedule would not permit for our meeting today.

Thank you,

Laura

Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office=
 Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the e=
state's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment onc=
e a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate=
.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these=
 services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser=
vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has n=
o way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enro=
n for everything from email, internet, network services and office applicat=
ions as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are c=
oncerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in =
Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastruc=
ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support =
services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy=
stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our =
Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support=
 their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications =
into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal w=
as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  =
Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it=
 may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges=
t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on =
the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro=
m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee=
n the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog=
ether a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

Subject:=09Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary



Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by =
Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books=
, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some co=
de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens=
ure the applications still talk to each other.=20
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio=
ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app=
lications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional perm=
utations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degr=
ee.=20
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin=
g their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise =
that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio=
n system level before the enterprise integration test starts.=20
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point).=20
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es=
tate and New Co.=20
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex=
ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to=
 support go live to production.=20
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve=
rsion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integrat=
ion Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too=
 tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility.=20
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co=
nversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical pa=
th for New Co.=20


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi=
ng first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down=
 dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and fina=
ncial on Jan 20.=20
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=
EP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=
 HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=
 to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=
e're in synch.=20
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=
icense of Unify.=20
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=
terparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=
ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=
g hard coded reference id risks.=20
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =
potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=
red to support day one trading.=20
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=
iderations. The time window will be very small.=20


Core Conversion Team =20
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen

7) John Warner

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Adds comment from CFO Fastow in fourth paragraph, Enron's
short-term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its
finances. The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends
on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to
finance day-to-day operations.

     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13
billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,
any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to
$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declined
to comment.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.

     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying two
partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership
of them was a conflict of interest.

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books.

     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may have
to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's
debt ratings fall too far.

Enron CFO: Company Has Sufficient Liquidity
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.
In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
The procedures were "rigorously followed," Lay said. 
In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were "reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties." 
Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. 
The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. 
During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. 
Lay said the company would be providing a list of "Frequently Asked Questions" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. 
After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
Lay said he was "extremely disappointed" in the current stock price. 
"Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business," he said. 

During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. 
Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a "worst-case scenario." 
However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. 
Moody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. 
According to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. 
"We are committed to maintaining our ratings," Lay said. "Moody's said they would work with us," he added. 
Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have "sufficient liquidity" to meet all its capital requirements. 

Enron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. 
Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
"Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that," Lay said.

Enron says shareholders' 'best interests' were sought in all LJM dealings

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp said it sought the "best interests" of its shareholders in all its dealings with LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships which were set-up and run until recently by Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
"The board (of Enron) was fully aware and kept a real Chinese wall between Enron and LJM. Enron's shareholders best interests were sought in all LJM dealings," said Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay, in a conference call with analysts.
The company scheduled the call after Enron's stock slid 21 pct yesterday, when it revealed the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. 
Overnight, two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against Enron and its officers, alleging that operating results were also "materially overstated" as a result of the company failing to timely write-down the value. 
In its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, of 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders' equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow resigned from the partnerships in July, due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests. 
During the call, Lay said that he, and Enron's board of directors, have "the highest faith and confidence in (Fastow)." 
Lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations, and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating. 
Analysts have raised the possibility that, should Enron's credit rating and stock price continue to fall, the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with.

US class action suit filed against Enron for misleading statements

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against Enron Corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between Jan 18, 2000 and Oct 17, 2001, thereby inflating the company's share price artificially. 
The suit was filed on behalf of Enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the US District Court in Houston against Enron Corp, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned recently, and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
The suit claims that Enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy.
The company's operating results were also "materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships" managed by the company's CFO. The suit additionally alleges that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. 
On Oct 16, Enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non-recurring charges of 1.01 bln after-tax, or 1.11 usd per share, which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's chief financial officer. Enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd. 
Enron's share price consequently fell sharply. During the class period, Enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally-held Enron common stock. 
Holders of Enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than Dec 21, Milberg Weiss said. 
Yesterday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions.

Word of SEC probe puts Enron into deep dive: Problems mount

NEW YORK - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20% yesterday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.
The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. 
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took US$1.01-billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined US$5.49, or 21%, to US$20.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shaving off almost US$4.2-billion of its market capitalization. 
The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8% yesterday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related-party transactions" involved the partnerships. 
"Related-party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Mr. Fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy- and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported US$35-million of its third-quarter loss of US$638-million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. 
"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." 
The price of shares in the company is down 75% this year.

City - SEC inquiry sparks Enron share fall.
By Simon English.

in New York 
ENRON, the American power giant, saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which Mr Fastow has, or had, links. 
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement: "We welcome this request. We will co-operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." 
Questions were raised last week on Wall Street after the company announced a write-down of more than $1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses. 
The disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23pc. Yesterday they fell another $5.30 ( #3.80) to $20.75 in early trading. 
According to the annual report the "related party transactions", as Enron describes them, took place in 1999 and 2000, resulting in losses of $16m and $36m respectively. 
Mr Lay said that auditors approved the deals, but would not give further details of what they were. 
They are understood to have been hedging transactions against Enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment JP. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," added Mr Lay. 
The relationship between the investment losses and the SEC probe is not clear, though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions. 
Enron owns Teesside Power Station and Wessex Water in Britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the US. Investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company's credit rating. 
An Enron spokesman said Mr Fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion. 
The SEC inquiry is "informal", says the company. The watchdog contacted Enron last Wednesday, the day of the results announcement. The SEC declined to comment. 
Enron made a loss of $638m in the third quarter, its first in over four years.

Shares of Enron Plummet 21% Energy: SEC requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive.

Shares of Enron Corp. set a 52-week low Monday on word that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the Houston-based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said it had voluntarily provided information on "certain related-party transactions" that had been previously disclosed to the SEC.
"We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive. 
"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest," he said. 
The SEC request is the latest in a parade of bad news for Enron, which has seen investments sour in telecommunications, retail electricity sales and water. 
Investors have battered the company's stock, which once sold for nearly $85 a share in the last year, and many have criticized Enron's stingy meting out of financial information. But several Wall Street analysts remain upbeat on the stock, noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn. 
In August, Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, one of the main architects of the company's strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit, stunned Wall Street by resigning. 
Skilling cited personal, family-related reasons, but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company's stock price contributed to his departure. 
On Monday, Enron shares plunged $5.40, or nearly 21%, to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron's stock has lost nearly 40% of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third-quarter loss of $618 million after $1.01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments. 
But the charge also included $35 million related to what Enron described only as the "early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity." 
In a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings, the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions. 
But investors were stunned when stories last week in the Wall Street Journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and that Enron had whittled $1.2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $1.2-billion note it had received from the partnership. Shareholder equity now stands at $9.5 billion. 
The limited partnership, called LJM2, and Fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved Enron assets and stock, the Journal reported. 
Lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed. 
A shareholder lawsuit charging that Enron's directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in Texas state court. 
Many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes, but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them, analyst say. 
Investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that Enron has guarded financial information, making it difficult to analyze the company's complex web of businesses. 
And many are not confident that all the bad news has been released. 
Analyst M. Carol Coale, who follows Enron and other energy companies for Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron to a "hold" from a "buy" rating Monday out of such frustration. 
Coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of Enron. 
But Bob Christensen, energy analyst with First Albany Corp., said that despite Enron's recent difficulties, the bulk of the business remains strong. 
"I continue to tell investors that 70% of this company's business is growing at a 26% rate, and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on," he said. 
Investors are panicking because of a "bad news story that doesn't reflect reality," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with the Raymond James & Associates brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
"They are the world's largest energy trader, and they are very good at that," Cartwright said. 
"The reality is that everything is fine here," although more charges, perhaps $500 million worth, are expected in the next few quarters, related to businesses that Enron is selling.

I'd like to send the following from Greg Whalley to North American employees.  It is a quick update on the timing of the North American wholesale gas and power business auction.  Given the number of media reports out there, groups of employees, particularly those in the Wholesale business, are asking for some info.  Before everybody begins to leave for the holidays, we'd like for them to know what's going on with this process.  

Hopefully, by sending this out from Greg, we can avoid the longer process of receiving and responding to input from the broader group of legal advisors.  I have included everybody, though, and if anybody takes exception to my view, please send me your comments.  Otherwise, I'll ask Brian Rosen to approve the following for accuracy.  Once I receive his approval, I'll plan to send this out:

There have been several media reports regarding the status of our efforts to preserve the value of our North American natural gas and power business.  As we've said, we'd like to form a joint venture with an entity with a strong credit rating so that our trading business can continue to deliver value to our company and our creditors.  We'd like to update you on the timing of the process as we currently see it.

This Wednesday, December 19th, we will ask the Bankruptcy Court to approve bid procedures for potential suitors to follow as they proceed to make offers for a joint venture.  If we are successful, we will ask the judge to set a bid deadline of January 7th, 2002.  Additionally, we will continue to try to close a deal prior to January 7th, which would be subject to competitive bids from other counterparties.   The number of counterparties interested in a deal continues to grow.  We plan to ask the court to approve the highest and best offer on January 11th, 2002.

Between now and the bid deadline, we will continue to work with all interested parties and assist them in their respective due diligence processes so that they can make the most informed bids.  Many of our colleagues will be working very hard over the holidays to move this process along and help ensure that our efforts to come out of bankruptcy are successful.  Please give them your full cooperation and support.

Big Pig:

Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?  


UBS:

Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI.

Based on my discussions with Jeanie Slone, I believe she has been severed.  I consistently followed the sitiuation to ensure she was retained and it was my understanding this was the way it was to be handled.  I know there is not a policy manual on this situation, but I spoke with Jeanie to ensure coverage.  It is my understanding Jeanie was discussing this matter with David Oxley or you.

Michelle/Jeff,

John Donnolly, Head of HR this potential partner, asked me this afternoon for the following data. We have this and can send it, but can you confirm that it is ok:

Employment agreements for "top 5"
Summary of last 12 months total compensation (including Base, Bonus, LTI, Keysop, retention and contracts payments).

I promised to get this to him tonight or tomorrow.

Seems to me if they have signed a confidentiality agreement and we are close to a deal with them this maybe appropriate. I'd volunteer to take the names off and just have  our GIS numbers as a code, but suspect this will confuse everyone.

David

David -

Tana expressed concern last night that Sally Beck's world doesn't seem to have much direction and with Bob Hall deciding not to go to NETCO, there is a lot of talk/speculation about why he is not going.

Just wanted to bring this to your attention - Lavo asked that we add Sally back on the NETCO list, but then said for us not to tell her.  I think with Bob's departure, we need to identify and communicate who the lead is so that the team can be given direction and get things back on track.  

Let me know your thoughts - any help that you can give would be greatly appreciated.

Amy

Well our "Administration" feels a lot more like a liquidation.  I am not sure how much longer I will have access
to Enron House in London.  They shut off my outgoing calls on my cell phone yesterday but our email still works. 
They are totally focused on preserving value for our creditors and will spend little resource on protecting Enron
or Directors of Enron companies outside of EEL.  Michael and I are still trying to work these other issues
on Enron's behalf. 

Two critical things that Michael is working on:
*  Working with the regulators on an orderly windown of our business.  This is a challenge because PWC's
   initial take on the situation is to nominate everything at zero.
*  Getting an agreement in place to have some Enron corp people get access to the building and files so
    that we can work on other Enron companies and issues that do not fall under the EEL umbrella.  But
    they have the keys to the building and they hit pretty fast.  For example to save paper, they have now
    shut off all the printers.  We are using Jim Hughes as the focal point for this.  And here the major
    contact besides Michael is Eric Shaw at 3

So anyway here is how you can get ahold of me if our normal Enron communications break down further:

FYI

my home number is 01732-832-807
email address LSherriff'btinternet.com
home cell number is 07811454933

And Michael's home number is 011-44-1582-760-140

John,

This is a little rough. I have taken the Enron current short form and made one or two adjustments. Perhaps you would review this as a draft for discussion. 

Michelle, can you check the things I've added/adjusted.

Louise
Have a few questions on the list of key personnel you gave to me

1.	There is a "Will" listed - sorry but I don't see anyone with
this last name in my list.
2.	There is a "Woulfe" listed - I couldn't find this so I presumed
this to be "Wolf" - am I correct.
3.	Also, there were a few people on your list who are analysts or
trading assistants - rotation 2.  Is it correc that these are people we
would deem key, ie., potential provide incentives to stay in order to
ensure the business' success?
4.	Brad Mackay was listed twice - FYI

Many thanks

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. 
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. 
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while "we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well." Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. 
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was "very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about." He added "we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy." 
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. 
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. "There's the appearance you are hiding something," said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. "You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board." 
Mr. Lay responded, "We're trying to be as transparent as we can."

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. 
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. 
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. 
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. 
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' 
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' 
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. 
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' 
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. 
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. 
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Options Report
Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. 
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. 
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. 
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. 
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. 
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Lay tries to assure Enron investors 
Company's credibility questioned 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an "informal inquiry" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. 
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. 
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. 
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. 
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. 
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. 
"I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions," he said. 
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. 
He did say Enron was aware an "inherent conflict of interest" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. 
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. 
"There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron," he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. 
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the "highest faith and confidence" in Fastow, he added. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. 
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. 
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. 
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. 
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. 
"I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call," he said.

Busy signal 
Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.
Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about "developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels". 
But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to "address investor concerns" about its financial dealings. 
Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. 
Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. 
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. 
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. 
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." 
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. 
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. 
Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc.

Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750-million loan, ensuring access to credit if the beleaguered company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter. 
Enron's shares and bonds plunged after the firm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its finances.
The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75% this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends on a $3-billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations. 
As a second-tier commercial paper borrower, any ratings drop may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market and raise costs of short-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped 86 cents to close at $19.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars over the next 18 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, treasurer Ben Glisan said. The possible shortfall related to about $3.2-billion (U.S.) in notes that related entities sold to investors since 1999, he said. Proceeds from those notes were invested in various Enron assets. Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.

Abreast of the Market
Everest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay Resilient
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. 
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. 
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. 
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. 
Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. 
"Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market," Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. "Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it." 
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. 
Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. 
Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. 
Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. 
There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. 
Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. 
NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. 
Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. 
EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. 
AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31.

U.S. Energy Giant Weighs a Move To Pull Out of India

NEW DELHI -- Following Enron Corp. U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the "expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management" by the state government and its agencies.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. 
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled.
"The issue is timing," Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. 
"Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term," he added. 
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. 
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. 
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have "consequences." 
"I wouldn't be surprised by project delays," he told Reuters. "This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment." 
"I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before," he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. 
STOP AND THINK 
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. 
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. 
"There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered," Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, "The only risk is things might be delayed." 
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. 
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. 
"We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender," Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. 
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. 
"It's a good time to wait," said Saverys.

INDIA PRESS:British Gas Seeks ONGC Deal For Field Control

10/24/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- British Gas has offered India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) are claiming operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields following Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.'s 30% stake sale to BG, according to the report.
State-owned ONGC holds a 40% stake in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and Reliance owns 30%. 
The Enron Oil & Gas stake sale will fall through if BG isn't given the operatorship of the oil fields, Nigel Shaw, vice president of BG India said in the report. 
Shaw said the equity partners are in discussions on the issue of operatorship, the report said. 
British Gas is a unit of BG Group PLC (BRG). Enron Oil & Gas is a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE).

BG Offers ONGC Brazilian Assets to Get Managing Rights in India
2001-10-24 01:12 (New York)


     Mumbai, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- BG Group Plc has offered Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. a stake in exploration projects in Brazil if
India's biggest oil producer allows BG to run the oil fields it
bought from Enron Corp. in India, the Economic Times reported,
without citing any officials.

     BG's purchase of Enron's 30 percent stake in the three oil
and gas areas in India is contingent on winning the right to
manage the developments. Reliance and ONGC, which together own 70
percent of the exploration venture, have both claimed rights to
run the oil and gas fields.

     BG has asked ONGC to waive its right to decide the operator
after Enron quits in return for a stake in its oil and gas sites
in Brazil, the paper said. It didn't give details on the Brazilian
interests BG may offer ONGC. BG has set Oct. 31 as a deadline to
resolve the ownership dispute, the paper said.

     The purchase from Enron would give BG a 30 percent stake in
the Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63
percent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The
assets hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas.

     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian
partners, ONGC and Reliance, as well as from the nation's biggest
refiner, Indian Oil Corp.


House stimulus bill would give billions to huge companies; Senate Democrats present alternative
By CURT ANDERSON
AP Tax Writer

10/23/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals. 
Seven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits.
IBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chain Kroger, $9 million. 
In addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that could total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million. 
Counting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief over 10 years. 
The generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly. 
"It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is," said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
For individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than under the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier. 
The primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation "is a shot of adrenaline" that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation. 
"Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy," wrote Thomas, R-Calif. 
While bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid. 
The legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2002, far below the House GOP level. 
"This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly," said Baucus, D-Mont. 
Other Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines. 
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending. 
"Everything in this package needs to be stimulative," Grassley said. "There needs to be more done on the investment side."

KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKETS IMPACT: Both the Dow and the Nasdaq lost ground today after another big round of earnings news. 
FRANCIS: Lets go to Keith in Alaska with a quick question for Don and Don let`s give us a zippy answer to. 
LUSKIN: All right. 
CALLER: Hey Don I like to know as far as Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) is concerned, how representative of the energy sector is this because I`ve been watching as a small investor that`s kind of brand new, watching it just kind of plummet. So and I`m only investing a little bit every month in it but you think that`s pretty wise idea just kind of keep on doing small investments? 
LUSKIN: Well as a general investing strategy yes but Enron is a special case where we have a company that`s in bad trouble. We had a CEO who basically left without explanation a couple of months ago, then yesterday the CFO has been accused of some pretty strange looking self dealing issues. We don`t know how that`s going to resolve but this is a company under a cloud so you might want to hold off on your buying program until that cloud lifts a little bit. 
FRANCIS: All right Don, thank you very much; we appreciate it. Don Luskin. 
LUSKIN: All right.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much=

Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 1=

the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Rev=
iews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit.=20
"A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third q=
uarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next =
year," said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist.=20
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on a=
bout $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a reco=
rd $42.3 billion in 2000.=20
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated "BB-plus" or lower by=
 S&P and "Ba1" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will rea=
ch 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate.=20
"The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession," said S&P Chief Economist Davi=
d Wyss in a statement. "Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relativ=
ely mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is=
 high."=20
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a thr=

wngrade in September alone on the attacks.=20
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS=20
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons.=20
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal compani=
es to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed=
 merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlin=
es, insurance and travel.=20
"Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dr=
y up and be pushed over the brink," said David Keisman, managing director a=
t S&P Risk Solutions.=20
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines.=20
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world=
's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock,=
 at a time S&P said the company's "growth prospects for the future are less=
 optimistic."=20
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it a=
gain. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confid=

weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business.=20
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part beca=
use interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets =
more conservatively.=20
"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing=
 costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost busine=

Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgr=

Enron's stock continues slide on credit woes

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s stock slid to new lows on Monday, pushed down =
in part by Moody's Investors Service announcing a possible downgrade of the=
 company's credit rating pending a review.=20
The downgrade came as Enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit l=

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)
2001-10-29 16:46 (New York)

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)

     (Adds bondholder quote and background on commercial paper.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares declined
a ninth day as Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit
rating, raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut off
from raising the cash it needs to fund day-to-day operations.

     Moody's lowered Enron's senior unsecured long-term debt
ratings to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1'' and also
placed the Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.

     Moody's may downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, which
would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short-term cash
needed to run its trading businesses. Ahead of a potential cut,
Enron took out bank lines to repay $2 billion in commercial paper
last week, largely removing itself from that borrowing arena.

     ``They've pretty much already written off coming to the
commercial-paper market,'' said Shannon Bass, who holds Enron
bonds in the $50 million he helps manage at Pacific Investment
Management Co. ``The real issue now is trying to get their house
in order.''

     Pimco is ``well underweight'' Enron bonds relative to bond
benchmarks the portfolios are matched to, Bass said.

                             Shut Out

     Companies such as Xerox Corp., which was shut out of the
commercial-paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were
reduced, were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access
cash. Investors in commercial paper, borrowings due in nine months
or less, also stopped buying Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies
Inc. short-term debt, forcing the firms to restructure borrowing,
sell assets, and find alternative financing sources that typically
cost more.

     Enron shares plunged $1.59, or 10 percent, to $13.81,
continuing a slide that dates back to Oct. 17, when Enron reported
$1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of
energy trading.

     The stock traded near $90 in September 2000 and touched a
seven-year low of $13.55 today. Enron has lost more than $50
billion in market value this year. On Dec. 31, the company had a
market capitalization of $62.7 billion. Today, the market value
was $10.5 billion.

                           Deterioration

     While Enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week, its
bonds are down about 20 percent. A company's stock typically falls
faster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on
assets after bank loans are paid.

     The company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents
to 80 cents on the $1 of face value after the Moody's downgrade.
Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before that
downgrade, traders said. The bonds were trading at 100 cents the
week before.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before this
month, which ``led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,''
according to Moody's.

     ``A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their
borrowing power,'' said Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for Wayne
Hummer Investments LLC in Chicago. ``That's not a good place for
them to be. They have somewhat aggressive expansion plans.''

     Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-
rating reduction. ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen,
who holds Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he
helps manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     There are about $15.8 billion of Enron bonds outstanding,
almost $9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006,
according to Bloomberg data.

                            Cash Needed

     Last week, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed. In August, Jeff Skilling quit as Enron chief executive,
eight months after taking the position, and Chairman Ken Lay moved
back into the position.

    Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when Fastow's partnerships
were disclosed.

    Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``When you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings.
It's likely their trading volumes will go down'' as other energy
and financial firms seek higher-rated trading partners, said Sean
Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which gives
Enron's credit a junk grade of ``BB+.''

     Enron's long-term ratings outlook was changed last week to
negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the firm's
rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
``We are still investment grade.''



Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.59, or 10 percent, to
$13.81. The stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months.



Enron May Be Royal Dutch/Shell Takeover Target, Newsletter Says
2001-10-29 13:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
the second-largest publicly traded oil company, may be interested
in buying Enron Corp., which has seen its stock price plunge in
the last two weeks, industry newsletter Power Finance & Risk
reported, citing unnamed sources.

     With Enron's market valued dropping below $11.5 billion from
a high of more than $55 billion, companies such as Royal
Dutch/Shell would be able to buy it with ``little trouble,'' the
newsletter reported.

     Royal Dutch/Shell, based in London and The Hague,
Netherlands, had approached Enron about a buyout in August, and
has sought to purchase the company for three years, the newsletter
said, citing an unnamed banker in London and an unnamed analyst in
New York.

     Shell spokesman Mary Brennan said the company wouldn't
comment on market speculation. Enron didn't immediately return
calls seeking comment on reports of possible buyout offer.



Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

     (Adds yield data in fourth paragraph; adds Moody's comments
in sixth and seventh paragraphs.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
was cut by Moody's Investors Service after the largest energy
trader wrote down the value of its assets because of losses from
private partnerships.

     Moody's also said it may downgrade Enron's commercial paper
rating, which could make it harder for the company to borrow the
short-term cash it needs to run its trading business in the
future. The company borrowed from banks to repay $2 billion in
commercial paper last week.

     ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen, who holds
Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he helps
manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as much as
4 cents to bid at 80 cents on $1 of face value after the Moody's
downgrade, traders said. The bonds tumbled from about par value a
week ago. Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before
that downgrade, traders said. Shares of Enron fell as much as
$1.85, or 12 percent, to $13.55.

     Moody's lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings
of Enron to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' The
ratings company said they may be lowered further. Moody's placed
the company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper on review for
downgrade.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before.

     Enron's recent disclosures have ``led to a substantial loss
in investor confidence,'' Moody's said in its news release.

                            Cash Needed

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses this month from
investments outside its business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
quit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed.

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when the partnerships were
disclosed.

     Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the  cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``Enron definitely depends on higher ratings,'' Dineen said.
     Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed last
week to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed
the Houston-based company's rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of
Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
`` We are still investment grade.''

ds its shares half off their 2001 highs? Internet? Telecom equipment?=20
Surprise! The stock is Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary) , and the ind=
ustry is electric utilities.=20
Three other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides=
 as well, only to find themselves well off their 52-week highs: AES (AES:NY=
SE - news - commentary) , Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary) and NRG Ene=
rgy (NRG:NYSE - news - commentary) .=20
These four companies also have something else in common: Insiders at all of=
 them are signaling that their stocks are oversold. When there is significa=
nt insider buying in so many related firms, we cannot help but think there =
is a positive industry trend to profit from.=20
Utilities may not seem like a sexy sector, but these particular stocks have=
 proved that they can move as well as any small-cap, high-tech play. Their =
volatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not re=
gulated utilities paying fat dividends, but independent power producers (IP=
Ps) that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs=
.=20
In some ways, IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was=
 to the Spanish Armada. IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography=
 of their business movements. This has spurred a more entrepreneurial cultu=
re at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when c=
hasing after business opportunities.=20
The insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting. They al=
l had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period, and =
many of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies' sha=
res. Several were also adding significantly to their holdings.=20
At AES, for example, three of the eight executives that purchased shares in=
 late September for $13 a share or less, were also smart sellers over the p=
ast few years when AES fetched between $40 to $60. And at Mirant, the five =
insiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average=
 of 53%.=20
This confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me =
researching these companies and this industry further, and I like what I se=
e.=20
"There's been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy," rema=
rks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP st=
ocks are weak now. "But while supply may be fine right now, you also have t=
o look at the quality of [that] supply. There is such a tremendous opportun=
ity to replace infrastructure."=20
Out With the Old, In With the New
The fact is, there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened ba=
ckbones in the power industry, and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from =
replacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy=
 in the U.S. and abroad.=20
With more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present, aging facil=
ities exacerbating price spikes, municipalities and industry would much rat=
her choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are ava=
ilable.=20
Although most IPPs use oil, gas, coal or a combination of these fuels to po=
wer present facilities, the vast majority of plants they're building now ar=
e a new generation of natural gas-powered turbines that are much more effic=
ient than old gas-fired facilities. An IPP will typically build one of thes=
e new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity n=
eeds, and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business.=
=20
But it's not really fair competition. New plants can generate up to 40% mor=
e energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs. The new na=
tural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than t=
heir predecessors, and can therefore be located closer to where the power i=
s needed. Can you say lower transmission costs?=20
So with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two-thirds of a gen=
erator's cost, less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmissi=
on infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP's bottom line=
.=20
As older gas-fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned, IPPs will continu=
e to increase the amount of product (and profits) they produce. At the same=
 time, the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increa=
ses in overall demand for natural gas, and keep the cost of this commodity =
from reaching stratospheric levels.=20
Although, as previously mentioned, IPP stocks are well off their highs, ana=
lysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now. Most analysts =
following the four IPPs I've recommended rate them a buy or strong buy.=20
This is not too surprising considering that bottom-line growth for NRG, AES=
, and Calpine next year is forecast at 24% to 25%, while analysts expect Mi=
rant to boost earnings per share by 30% in 2002. All of these shares are tr=
ading for 12 times or less the low end of next year's EPS expectations.=20
Chartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I've mentioned st=
ill look weak, and may choose to wait for a better entry point. But longer-=
term investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now.=20
Postscript
Readers will note that we have not included Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commen=
tary) in our group of recommended IPPs. Although we cannot boast of foresee=
ing its present travails (resulting from too-clever-by-half off-balance she=
et investments), we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive in=
sider signal like its peers.=20
Insiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug. 2 of this year when the s=
tock was nearly half off its highs, and although there was one insider purc=
hase in August, there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP sto=
cks we've recommended. There was no buying after Sept. 11.=20
If Enron's problems are unique to it, as the industry insiders we talked to=
 believe, this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellen=
t signal of relative attractiveness of stocks within an industry.=20


A Debacle Like Enron's Can Undermine the Entire Market

Sometimes one stock can completely transfix the market in a negative way.=
=20
Right now that one stock is Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . It trans=
fixes us because it acknowledges a simple truth: We are just dealing with p=
ieces of paper here, pieces of paper backed up by nothing but the honesty a=
nd culture of the people who work at the company.=20
When you put it that way, you realize how fragile this game can be. We have=
 to believe that the system of checks and balances we have -- outside accou=
ntants, lawyers and the SEC -- can put enough pressure, honest pressure, on=
 execs to keep them from doing the wrong thing.=20
When they don't we have no clue of what we are buying.=20
I keep thinking back to Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which colla=

up Cendant was a bogus company: CU International. Who knew what the company=

ho knew what the company was worth? Who knew how to value it?=20
When you don't know, you don't average down. You sell. You ask questions la=

That's what is going on with Enron right now, and it is freaking out everyb=

Anytime you get a stock that is widely held that loses billions in market c=
apitalization overnight, whether it be Lucent (LU:NYSE - news - commentary)=

that is doing more than just pulling down utilities. The market is about co=

Moody's downgrades Enron's debt
Enron asking banks for more credit=20
Lisa Sanders
CBSMarketWatch.com
10/29/01
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Shares of Enron fell further Monday after Moody's Inves=
tors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt a notch.
Enron, which hit a 52-week high of $84.88 on Dec. 29, was well on its way t=
o another year low Monday. Heading for a ninth straight day of losses, Enro=
n shed more than 9 percent, or $1.41, to $13.99. The stock was again the mo=
st active mover on the New York Stock Exchange as close to 28 million share=
s had changed hands.
Moody's said it cut the senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, =
and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades. The a=
ction follows Enron's reported $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter an=
d was driven by the expectation of further write-downs and the swift deteri=
oration of the company's financial picture, said Stephen Moore, vice presid=
ent at Moody's.=20
"However, we do feel the move Enron made to draw down their revolvers to pa=
y off their commercial paper was a smart business move," said Stephen Moore=
, vice president at Moody's. The rating agency said it would review the Pri=
me-2 rating on Enron's commercial paper.
Last Thursday, Enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide=
 more than $1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $2 billion to=
 pay down commercial paper.
The decision to pay off the commercial paper, he said, accomplishes two goa=
ls.
"It increases liquidity on a short-term basis, and additionally, it enables=
 them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now," Moore said.=
 "They are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital=
 to support their wholesale trading business."=20
Karen Denne, an Enron spokesperson, confirmed Monday that the company is in=
 discussions with banks for further financing. Additional credit would help=
 boost Enron's liquidity position.
The lingering concern for Moody's is that there "yet may be something else =
out there that gets to the credibility issue of Enron itself," Moore said.=
=20
At the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships -- LMJ a=
nd LMJ2 - created in 1999 by former CFO Andy Fastow and since dissolved. En=
ron ousted Fastow last week. See related story. </news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B=
FCA73BA9%2D55D0%2D4EE8%2DB6E7%2DBD924898CA4B%7D&siteid=3Dmktw> "The market =
was unaware," of the existence of the partnerships, Moore said.
"Quite frankly, we don't think there is anything else," he said. "But Enron=
 is huge, and if this could happen...there is a lingering concern that some=
thing else might happen. We cannot confirm or deny that this is true. We wi=
ll be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these."
Moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week.
"Should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein becom=
e impacted by these events, that could lead to the slowing growth of the wh=
olesale business, the Enron engine," he said.=20
Moody's action Monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts --=
 Marlin Water Trust and Osprey, which have combined debt of $3.2 billion. M=
arlin is now rated Baa2, while Osprey carries a new rating of Baa3, both do=
wn a notch.
The potential issue for the trusts may be "how much equity Enron would have=
 to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn't enough to pay of=
f the debt." Enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of asse=
ts to meet its obligation.

Enron Goes Begging=20
Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com </news>, 10.29.01, 11:40 AM ET=20

NEW YORK - Enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for addit=
ional credit, as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six-year=
 low and several large energy groups put their dealings with Enron on hold.=
 Last Thursday, the energy trader drew down about $3 billion from a credit =
line, causing its bonds to fall sharply on Friday.=20

Enron (nyse: ENE ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business p=
artners since Oct. 16--after the company reported its first quarterly loss =
in more than four years. The $638 million loss included $1.01 billion in ch=
arges on ill-fated investments. A week later, it disclosed that the U.S. Se=
curities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships =
run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Fastow w=
as forced to step down from the company last week.=20

The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron's problems weren't solved=
 by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.


In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks=20
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001
By BILL WHITE=20
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should n=
ow take the time to say "thanks" when the company has experienced some high=
ly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous=
ton and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encoura=
ged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by mak=
ing a big difference in their community.=20
Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a=
 multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it c=
ompeted hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other n=
atural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark=
et of electricity. The downtown concentration of these firms -- industry le=
aders including Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy -- led London's Fi=
nancial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricit=
y.=20
This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- with the average age=
 of Enron employees at under 35 -- and they in turn helped fuel an explosio=
n in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in turn, helped revita=
lize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's construction of a larg=
e Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone in Houston's growth,=
 an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office sp=
ace.=20
Virtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on=
 Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volu=
nteer activities. If Enron or its chairman, Ken Lay, led a visionary effort=
, such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers, or more recently the p=
rivate funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center, Houstonians knew it wou=
ld be done right. Without Lay our town would have lost major league basebal=
l and status as a big league town.=20
Employees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees base=
d on their potential, with no glass ceilings. Women have run large division=
s and subsidiaries. Many military officers find that Enron called on their =
talents after illustrious military careers, even at ages well past normal c=
orporate entry level. The most highly recruited young people flock to a com=
pany that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far =
and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them.=20
Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees =
who have lived the American dream. With the habits of work learned on a fam=
ily farm in Missouri, Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degre=
e at the University of Houston, served his country in government and began =
a career in the gas pipeline business. When Northern Natural Gas acquired t=
he smaller Houston Natural Gas, Northern's chairman surprised folks by inst=
alling Lay as his successor. I was at Northern's headquarters in Omaha the =
week after the merger 16 years ago when Northern's chairman reassured folks=
 that they could count on "best young executive in the business, Ken Lay," =
to direct their future in a changing marketplace. Within 15 years, most of =
Enron's revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist w=
hen Lay had taken over, all of which had been created from within the firm.=
 This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness t=
hat attracted top talent to his team.=20
Enron rewarded innovation, while many firms afraid to alter the old formula=
 wondered why their leadership eroded. Year after year, top executives thro=
ughout the country voted Enron our nation's most innovative corporation. En=
ron recognized, even when financial markets do not, that innovative firms a=
re secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of o=
ther successes.=20
Rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace, as had m=
any American businesses, Enron welcomed the challenge of the international =
market, confident that American firms could compete and win. Enron also wel=
comed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship, and called on=
 industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies fea=
red the impact of pollution control on their bottom line.=20
Enron's phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expe=
ctations, as early this year when the stock market valued the company based=
 on 20 percent annual growth, forever. Enron's size and success made it a c=
onvenient target for politicians in California and India, even as Enron sup=
plied the electricity they so needed. Sometimes it seemed the company's ups=
tart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm's perc=
eption that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog.=20
And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as stro=
ng people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than =
a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh=
o hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne=
ver to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story.=
=20
Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find s=
o many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live a=
nd work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to expre=
ss thanks and steady support.=20

The MNA covers form commodity and trading agreements entered into between specified Dynegy and Enron entities.  I spoke with Sheila Tweed (who did the Sithe deal) about this and  we got comfortable that no aspects of the Sithe deal were done under the form trading agreements or between the specified entities.  In addition, the Enron Corp. Guaranty that will be used in connection with the MNA will not supersede the Enron Corp. Guaranty issued in connection with the Sithe transaction.

Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process.  I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute.  I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.

I am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven't received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure. 

It is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren't for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with "it's safe," "don't worry about it," "all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate," "low probability that there will be any issues," ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.

When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  
Because the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.
Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue!
Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.
Because we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.
Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.


Since I am not "on the team" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people "on the team" versus not "on the team."  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.

Furthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.

To be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:
the deal as it exists plus
retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.
indemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.

I expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.

In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  

Finally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.

Tim

For Rings 4, 5, 6, and 7(all PJM) I noticed that there is an inconsistency between (1) the "Term" section, which refers to "Central Prevailing Time" and (2) the "Scheduling" section, which refers to "Eastern Prevailing Time."

Working under the assumption that the "Term" for PJM is supposed to refer to "Eastern Prevailing Time,"  I changed the "Term" section of Ring "H" to EPT to match the Scheduling section.

I suggest we check with Melissa Murphy tomorrow to confirm the correct time zone for the "Term" section of PJM, so that we can make appropriate corrections---either to Ring H, or to Rings 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Frank,

We have already done a number of things to help reduce AEP's exposure to Enron, none of which were required contractually.  We made a margin payment of $50,000,000.  We arranged ring-trades with Allegheny which reduced your exposure by over $90,000,000.  We have proposed a number of assignments which would reduce your exposure to Enron incrementally.  

Conversely, pursuant to our contracts AEP has failed to pay a $1,311,625.46 swap settlement that was due on 11/8/01.  Additionally, a margin call which was due to Enron on 11/8/01 in the amount of $19,250,000 and remains unpaid.  Additionally, AEP has failed to continue to trade with Enron which was not our understanding of the agreement.

Enron maintains its investment grade credit rating and is receiving $1.5 billion of additional funded equity capital from Dynegy as announced on Friday.  We are more than happy to continue helping you to reduce exposures in mutually agreeable manners but do not agree to the below list of requests.  We need you to address these above issues before we can progress on these exposure reductions.

Regards,
Bill

Per our conversation on November 12, 2001, AEP has reassessed it's risk tolerance for Enron Corporation.  In light of the current status, we propose the following things to be done to allow for normal trading and other business activity to commence: 
        A fully executed Master Set Off Agreement (MSA) with an Adequate Assurance provision and no MAC clauses. 
        An agreement that allows for same day margining 
        Cash collateral or Letter of Credit to bring exposure down to zero 
        Work towards executing an EEI Agreement 
        HPL post closing settlement payment must be paid as agreed by both parties 
        Settlement of all payments due and past due 

These are the critical issues we feel must be addressed to get things back to normal.  We appreciate all that has been done thusfar in working to mitigate our exposure, however, we now feel that more should be done to protect what we have at risk. 

I look forward to your reply, should you have any questions, comments or otherwise, please give me a call. 

Best Regards,

Louise,

I have master counterparty lists from credit, legal and eol.  Milnthorp and I are getting input from the various desks - we have "national accounts", large regionals and customers.  They are ranked by volume and include type of contract, entity name, credit limits, etc. There are approx 50 counterparties that we want to hit in the first week of business.   We will have some good detail by jan 7.

Regards,

Chris

Please let me know if you guys are still willing to do 3-way offsets/netting/sleeving or whatever you call it. Your pjm trader wants to charge  about $100k for 600mw in summer 02 with el paso.

Thanks. Also my assistant was checking with yours to see if any alternative to 9am tomorrow. If not we will still take it.

I was responding to Louise's request. I understood her request as one of id=
entifying what we used and then deciding whether it made sense to bring the=
m. If I can't have any of below systems we will be ok, but I will probably =
need one or two more people and a budget to buy a personnel database of som=

I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change.   His current salary is already Director level type comp.   I potentially may need another 25k, but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff.   Please talk to Doug directly on the justification.

Subject: CSFB IPP Weekly: DYN/ENE Deal Mitigates Overhang; MIR
MeetingPre view; New Regional Spark Spread Analysis


 <<IPW111201a.pdf>> 
Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Summary:
1. IPPs Rise 3.8%   Last week our IPP composite rose 3.8%, outperforming the
S&P 500 (+3.0%), but underperforming the NASDAQ (+4.7%).  Mirant, which was
up 12.9%, was the strongest generator in the group.  International Power was
the weakest performer, declining 2.4%.

2. Generation Oriented Utilities Rise 5.5%   Our universe of generation
oriented utilities rose 5.5%, outperforming all major indices including the
UTY (4.0%).  Constellation Energy, which was up 8.6%, was the strongest
performer in the group.  Cleco Corp was the weakest performer, improving
3.4%.

3. DYN/ENE Deal Removes Overhang   We attribute last week's strong
performance to indications of an imminent resolution to Enron's financial
difficulties in the form of an investment from Dynegy.  Late on Friday,
these reports proved true with Dynegy agreeing to acquire Enron and provide
immediate liquidity support.  Over the last few weeks, the group came under
pressure owing to concerns about Enron's deteriorating credit quality.  In
particular, IPP investors were concerned about the level of receivables
exposure of various companies to Enron.  Further, some industry observers
suggested that a damaging reduction in trading liquidity could result if
Enron were forced to withdraw from the natural gas and power markets.  

4. New Feature: Regional Spark Spread Analysis   Inside we include a
regional spark spread analysis looking back 2 years.  Going forward, this
analysis will be a regular feature in the Weekly.

5. Valuations Remain Attractive; Focus On the Major IPPs: Highlighting CPN,
MIR and NRG   Given diminishing Enron concerns, we would expect investors to
refocus on attractive valuations across the sector.  The pure play power
producers are trading at a 12% average discount to their private market
asset values.   We continue to highlight Calpine, Mirant and NRG Energy.  

6. MIR Hosting Analyst Seminar   On Tuesday (11/13), Mirant will host its
second major analyst meeting in Atlanta, Georgia.  We expect management to
discuss the following: 1. Business plan update; 2. 2002 earnings visibility;
3. Financing plans; and 4. Reaction to DYN/ENE deal.

7. CSFB Philippines Energy Forum; Relevant to MIR   On 11/15 at 3.30 pm CSFB
will host a Philippines Energy Forum at the Waldorf Hotel in NYC.  The
meeting will feature 3 speakers: 1. Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal Arroyo,
The President of the Philippines; 2. the Honorable Vincent S. Perez, Jr.,
Secretary of the Department of Energy of the Philippines; and, 3. Rick
Kuester, CEO of Mirant Asia Pacific.  The forum will focus on upcoming
developments and opportunities in the power and oil/gas industry in the
Philippines.

Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal

10/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 
Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss.
However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. 
In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. 
In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company "unwound" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a "structured finance vehicle" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. 
The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply, the report said. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, "the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this," Causey said. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described the capital reduction "as just a balance-sheet issue" and therefore was not deemed "material" for disclosure purposes.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 
The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 
GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 
The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 
Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

USA: Enron's stock slides as equity reduction digested.

10/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock fell sharply on Thursday as investors digested news of a $1.2 billion reduction in the energy giant's shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week. 
In afternoon trading Enron's stock was off $2.96 or, 9.2 percent at $29.24 per share.
Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on Tuesday after taking charges of $1.01 billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations. 
The reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company's earnings statement but was discussed by Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on Tuesday. 
"Confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure. This is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much," said one analyst who asked not to be identified. 
The reduction in equity was prominently reported in the Wall Street journal on Thursday, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience, analysts said. 
Lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of Enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some Wall Street analysts. 
As a result of the operation, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent, but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year, Lay said. 
Moody's Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several Enron businesses. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings.

Brazil's Copene, Elektro Plan to Sell 820 Mln Reais of Bonds
2001-10-18 13:53 (New York)


     Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Two Brazilian
companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell
820 million reais ($279 million) of bonds, raising the amount of
pending local market bond sales to 7.5 billion reais.

     Brazil's Copene-Petroquemica do Nordeste SA, a Petrochemical
company, has asked Brazil's government for permission to sell 625
million reais of bonds according to the country's security and
exchange regulator, the CVM. Banco Citibank SA, the Brazilian unit
of Citigroup Inc., will manage the sale.

     Elektro Eletricidade e Servicos SA, an electricity utility
controlled by U.S.-based Enron Corp. that distributes electricity
in Sao Paulo state, has asked for permission to sell 195 million
reais of bonds, according to a CVM filing.

     No further details about the sales was immediately available.
     Brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as
the local currency, the real, plunges against the dollar, making
dollar-denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as
the local currency value of dollar debts soars.

     So far this year, about 9.1 billion reais of local market
debt has been sold. Meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or
dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $1.7 billion in the
third quarter from $4.5 billion in the second, not including sales
through offshore subsidiaries, according to Bloomberg data.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Louise,

As I mentioned yesterday, I would like to have a meeting with all the ENA Estate troops some time mid to late morning today. Prior to that meeting, I believe that it is important for someone to have spoken with Ed.  Also, it would be great if you could be at the meeting (at least at the beginning) to, in a sense, toss me the "hot" potato.  I need to send out an email and wanted to know if you have a preference for the time?

Thanks,

Don

Louise,

I am in town and would like to meet up with you when you get a chance but have a hot question for you.

We have a new steel trade in London that is a back to back where we make $100,000.  It has us issuing an LC but we will be receiving an LC from the purchasers. Note we will get the LC from the purchaser prior to us posting an LC to the producer. If we need to post cash we can discount the LC from the purchaser to post cash. 

I think this meets the objectives but want to check with you. 

thanks and I will set up a time on your schedule.

regards
bruce

Louise, we may also have a buyer for our entire Ontario operation (staff + contracts). As you know, we have a ton of contracts/alliances that have never been marked as they are conditional on market opening. It would be a crying shame to have all of those terminate. By cc to peter, please see Louise to explain further.

I chatted with Jim - everything's cool. Call me when you need me. 

One question (Sally mentioned it) - is Bob Hall 'in'? She saw a list that had him in and excluded myself - is that an old list - hopefully....?

If I'm a first reserve for Bob or am I incremental? Just keep me posted. I won't be offended.

To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

Ken

Christi Nicolay and Sarah Novosel are the two best regulatory people.   In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.   Obviously, that will not work anymore.   I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.   I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner.   If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.

You are not off base with Steffes at all.

My issues with Rick have never been related to competence but were based on costs of his unit.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

Just talked to Leslie Reeves about the meeting today.
 
Did I miss something?  Did we ever talk about a presentation
around readiness for a January 20th implimetation?
 
Maybe I missed something or it went to the other Bob Hall.
 
After the holidays, I would like to get in your calendar and 
discuss how Operations gets included more upfront.
 
thanks

I make this about 15 full time people and probably the equivalent of another 7-10 for these other functions, plus their expenses. If you want I can try to nail down some names for these people but I'm not sure that makes a whole lot of sense. They are more efficiently pooled.

Blowback 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine </forbes>, 11.12.01 

Did Enron use partnerships to artificially boost earnings? Lawyers are rubbing their hands.
If the truth sets you free, the top echelon at Enron Corp., present and past, should be feeling positively footloose these days. Just in time to get shackled by a slew of shareholder suits. 

Private securities lawyers and the Securities & Exchange Commission are looking into the Houston energy trading firm's complex relationships with outside partnerships it used to hedge against fluctuations in the value of its investments. Where Enron sees 21st-century financial engineering, lawyers see possible earnings inflation. (Chairman Kenneth Lay says Enron is cooperating with the SEC inquiry.) 

One partnership, run by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, added $236 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2001, boosting Enron's $425 million in net income in that period. The partnership's contribution plunged to $5 million in the second quarter ended June 30, but investors only found out Aug. 14--when Enron filed its quarterly 10-Q with the SEC. Oddly enough, that was the day Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling unexpectedly resigned. 

Expect class-action lawyers to go after the profits Skilling and other insiders made by selling $660 million in stock when shares were flying high. (They're down 78% from August 2000.) Since Skilling left, Enron has taken a $1.2 billion hit to shareholders' equity to unwind partnerships. 

"They certainly misled the market as to the size of [partnership losses]," says Thomas Shapiro, one of several lawyers filing shareholder suits against Enron. Who knows what will emerge from some of the other partnerships?

Enron Shares Rise, Rebounding From Nine-Year Low (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in sixth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares rose as
much as 19 percent, one day after falling to their lowest level in
more than nine years, amid speculation the company may be a
takeover target.

     Shares of the top energy trader rose $1.58, or 14 percent, to
$12.74 in midday trading of 19.9 million shares, compared with the
three-month daily average of 10.4 million shares. Earlier, the
shares hit $13.25.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen 84 percent this
year. They have lost more than half their value this month amid a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships
headed by Andrew Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer.
Fastow was ousted last week in an attempt to restore confidence in
the stock.

     ``There are rumors out there that they are a potential
takeover target, but I think it's very unlikely that anyone will
buy them out at this point,'' said Zach Wagner, an analyst at
Edward Jones & Co. ``There are too many uncertainties.''

     Enron is more likely to get a large cash infusion from an
investor, Wagner said. He has a ``reduce'' rating on Enron shares.
He doesn't own the stock.

     The Wall Street Journal today said General Electric Co.'s GE
Capital, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Royal Dutch
Petroleum Co. are ``among the names bandied about'' as potential
buyers for all or part of Enron.

Enron Shares Rise as Analysts Cite Bargain-Hunting, Financing Speculation
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- After losing nearly two-thirds of their value over the past two weeks, Enron Corp. shares regained some lost ground Wednesday.
Bargain-hunting and speculation were said to be behind the buying, with some suggesting that Enron is nearing a deal for additional financing, while others are said to be mulling the possibility the company may be acquired. 
In afternoon trading on New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares (ENE) were up $1.49, or 13%, to $12.65 on volume of 24.9 million shares. Earlier, the stock traded as high as $13.25. 
Enron, which typically trades an average of 10 million shares a day, was again one of the most actively traded stocks on the Big Board. On Tuesday, Enron shares set a 52-week low of $10.90, which was the stock's lowest level in a decade. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade attributed the jump in Enron's stock to investors attracted by its low price. Those buyers, he said, are hoping not to be hit by the "double swords" hanging over the Houston energy trader -- a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the financial dealings of its former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with an off-balance sheet financing vehicle and the possibility of another credit-rating downgrade by Moody's, which could trigger the need to issue additional stock and thereby dilute the holdings of existing investors. 
In addition, there is speculation "through the Houston circuit" that Enron may be close to securing additional financing, said Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale. If the speculation proves true, the financing would help Enron to shore up its financial condition and improve confidence among investors as well as its business partners. 
Investors also may be placing their bets on the belief that Enron shares have eroded enough in value to make the company a takeover candidate. 
A report in The Wall Street Journal Wednesday said several companies including General Electric Co.'s (GE) GE Capital unit, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA, BRKB) and Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) have been named as potential buyers for Enron. 
Ms. Coale said the takeover speculation was "unwarranted" and has surfaced each time Enron shares faltered. 
"It would be very unusual ... for a company to be interested in a takeover (of Enron) given the uncertainty of the SEC inquiry. Why add that uncertainty to your portfolio?" she said. 
Furthermore, Ms. Coale said, it might be difficult for a company such as Shell to clear regulatory hurdles because it already operates a substantial energy trading business. 
Commerzbank's Mr. Meade also discounted the takeover speculation. He likened such a deal to the acquisition of a financial-service company. 
"You are buying a human-capital-based business. You have to make sure you're not going to loose all your people," he said. "It's a trickier acquisition." 
But not everyone thinks the takeover speculation is implausible. Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John Hancock Value Funds, said Shell and Enron are "neighbors", and Shell has looked at Enron "on and off." 
Still, he said that if there is a buyer for Enron, the company would want to do it sooner rather than later in order not to risk damaging Enron's leading market position. 
Some marketwatchers said at least some of the pressure on Enron shares in recent trading sessions has come from mutual funds liquidating their positions to avoid having the company's name appear among their holdings in their annual reports. 
Despite the rise in Enron shares Wednesday, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty about the stock. 
In addition to the pending SEC inquiry and the lingering credit concerns, attention also is being paid to their effect on Enron's trading business. While several trading counterparties have said that they are watching the situation closely, at least one, Entergy Corp. (ETR), is said to be trimming its exposure to Enron. 
The New York Mercantile Exchange also plans to use Enron's weakness to recapture part of the over-the-counter energy derivative market by offering its own clearing services and trading tools for the natural gas market.

Enron trades higher after heavy losses 
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com 
Last Update: 1:27 PM ET Oct. 31, 2001 
  
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron, which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions, spiked in Wednesday trading after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target.
  
Enron (ENE: news, chart, profile) added 13 percent, or $1.46, to $12.62 in recent dealings. Volume was heavy at 25 million shares.
John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, pointed out that the heavy losses Enron sustained over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds. The calendar year for funds ends at the close of business Wednesday.

"Mutual funds who own Enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off Enron," he said. "Mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today."

A Wall Street Journal report Wednesday speculated on Enron's potential as an acquisition for a more stable company. Enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks, beginning when the energy merchant reported a $1 billion charge in its third-quarter earnings. A Securities and Exchange Commission probe into two of the company's limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service haven't helped.

Olson said he thought an Enron takeover unlikely at this point. 

"However, if the stock were to keep coming down, and their financial difficulties were extended, the odds would increase," he said.
Art Smith, chairman and chief executive of the research firm John S. Herold, said he'd be surprised if Enron was not entertaining offers. "It's one of the ways that Enron gets the genie back in the bottle."

On the other hand, Smith said, it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business. 
"It's doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly," Smith said. He said it's likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a "look-back provision," which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value.
Smith said he could see either General Electric's (GE: news, chart, profile) GE Capital or Royal Dutch Shell (RD: news, chart, profile) making a bid. Both were mentioned in the Journal report.

"GE Capital is big enough that if it didn't work out it won't cripple GE, and they've been opportunistic on things like this," Smith said. "And Shell always keeps us guessing."
Olson also included AIG (AIG: news, chart, profile) and Citigroup (C: news, chart, profile) as potential acquirers. 

"Enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture," he said. 
Smith said that even without Enron, the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive. 

"Even if Enron went away, it would not change what has developed into a healthy market for commodity forward markets and hedging," he said.

USA: U.S. tech stocks up, blue chips shed gains.
By Haitham Haddadin

10/31/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Technology stocks held gains in early afternoon trading on Wednesday after the U.S. economy shrank less than Wall Street feared in the third quarter, but blue chips dipped as an early rally faded on worries the worst is yet to come. 
"You will need a lot of fortitude to see the mountaintop when we are in the depths of the valley," said Jay Mueller, economist and portfolio manager at Strong Capital Management Inc., which oversees $42 billion.
The economy suffered its worst contraction since the first quarter of 1991, the government said in its "advance" or early estimate of gross domestic product. GDP, the broadest measure of U.S. economic health, shrank 0.4 percent in the third quarter. The number still managed to beat economists' projected 1 percent drop and helped spark an early rally. 
Wall Street still faces a heavy economic calendar this week and is girding for readings on the manufacturing sector and job market. Some economists expect the U.S. economy will give an even worse performance in the fourth quarter as the Sept. 11 attacks haunt the nation. 
The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 28.65 points, or 1.72 percent, to 1,696.06, after snagging a gain of more than 3 percent earlier in the day. Sun Microsystems Inc. jumped 77 cents to $10.31, or 8 percent, after the network computer maker said orders were tracking higher this quarter than they were this time last quarter. 
The Dow Jones industrial average was off 6.23 points, or 0.07 percent, at 9,115.75, after climbing more than 1 percent. Eastman Kodak Co., down $2.69 to $25.11, or 9.7 percent, pressured the blue-chip gauge after Moody's cut its debt rating and warned it may lower the long-term rating again amid falling profits. 
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 4.03 points, or 0.38 percent, at 1,063.82. The stock market had sold off in the last two days after rallying last week. 
Wall Street widely expects the economy to slip into a recession. But investors are hoping more tax cuts and lower interest rates will lift the economy by 2002. President George W. Bush urged Congress to pass a stimulus package by the end of November in a speech at the White House. 
Most economists expect the economic contraction to last at least to the end of the year and if it does, the third quarter would mark the start of the first U.S. recession in 10 years. A recession is loosely defined as at least two straight quarters of falling GDP. 
In other economic news, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its October index slipped to 46.2 from 46.6 in September, but this beat economists' estimates of a drop to 43.0. 
The October index that showed less weakness than expected suggests regional manufacturing could bottom fairly soon, but does not necessarily mean Thursday's national survey by NAPM will follow suit, analysts said. 
"What it's showing is that the economy, although it's slowing now, is slowing at a gradual pace as opposed to rapidly plunging off a cliff," said John Herrmann, chief economist at IDEAglobal. "We think the NAPM index falls a little bit more than this because NAPM will capture corporations in New York and outside the region of Chicago." 
The October National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index, due shortly after the open on Thursday, is forecast on average slipping to 44.3 from 47.0 in September. 
Intel Corp., a Dow member and Nasdaq heavyweight, added 63 cents to $24.17, or 2.6 percent. The world's largest chip maker sounded a bullish note for long-term growth, saying the billions it's spending this year will yield profits and market share gains once the high-tech recession abates and growth resumes. 
Motorola Inc. rose 51 cents to $16.65, or more than 3 percent, after the wireless giant said its global market share rose in the July-September quarter from the second quarter, boosted by sales of new products. 
Adobe Systems Inc. fell $3.41 to $25.34, or nearly 12 percent. The publishing software vendor said it would cut 150 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, and lowered its revenue and earnings guidance, citing weakening business after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Enron Corp. rose $1.47 to $12.63, bouncing back from 10 consecutive days of losses. The Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday in its influential "Heard On The Street" column that with Enron trading at book value, some Wall Streeters see the beleaguered energy trader as a takeover target. Enron shares on Tuesday dropped 19 percent to hit 1992 levels amid fears of a credit crunch and concerns over management reluctance to discuss its finances.

US West Pwr Lower On New-Month Positions Despite Gas Rise

10/31/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Prescheduled power prices in the western U.S. fell somewhat despite higher spot natural gas prices in the region, traders said, attributing lower power prices to new market positions in the new month. 
"I think a lot of people came into November long," one trader said.
Western spot gas prices were down about 20 cents. Other power fundamentals were unchanged, with electric space heating demand remaining well below normal for this time of year due to mild weather. 
One trader said Enron had been aggressively selling down day-ahead power at Palo Verde as it covered a short position in the rest of the month. Later it bought day-ahead Palo Verde power, which drove the daily market back up. 
The short position at Palo Verde became a concern after rumors spread of a five-day delay in restarting a Palo Verde nuclear power plant unit that has been out for refueling since Sept. 28. 
The plant operator, Arizona Public Service, said the unit's restart had been delayed a day or two, not five days. 
On-Peak/MWh One Day Earlier 
Palo Verde, AZ $37.00-$39.50 $38.50-$41.50 
South Path 15, CA 37.00- 39.00 37.00- 40.00 
North Path 15, CA 37.00- 39.00 36.00- 39.00 
Mid-Columbia, WA 37.50- 39.40 36.00- 39.00 

Looking ahead, somewhat warmer temperatures forecast for Friday could cut heating demand in Thursday's prescheduled power market. Western U.S. electric space heating loads Friday are forecast to be 71% of normal for this time of year, compared with 76% of normal Wednesday, according to forecaster Weather Derivatives Inc.

UK: Enron close to exiting Indian LNG shipping deal.

10/31/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy major Enron Corp is close to exiting a joint shipping venture linked to its troubled Dabhol power plant in India, shipping sources said. 
"Enron has pulled out of the Lakshmi (the ship) and has dumped it on its partners in the deal, Mitsui OSK Lines and the Shipping Corporation of India," said one shipping executive.
"Essentially it's linked to the collapse of the Dabhol deal," he added. 
Enron has a 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant, which has been stalled by a long-running payment dispute with its only customer, a local utility. 
"We have been in discussions about Greenfield Shipping (the ship owning company), but at the moment it is not appropriate to comment on future plans," said a spokesman for Enron in Houston. 
The shipping source said the ship had been contracted at the above-market price of $223 million from MHI yard in Japan, and would need the high charter rate of $92,000 per day to cover its costs. This would be difficult to acheive. 
Enron said the ship had been financed through 70 percent debt and 30 percent equity, in which it had a 20 percent stake.

Delainey is recruiting everybody.  It will be very hard to meet the employee criteria set out by Umbrulla if this continues.  As you see below, he is even recruiting traders.  It's hard enough with the external companies.

Consensus now is that ALL gas and power systems and IP for trading will be put in Newco.  Enron will maintain all of its own systems and IP to support gas, power and all other commodoties.  Problem is this requires additional IT people immediately and may require additional hardware.  Think 50 additional workers for 1 to 2 months and $2 to $5 million for hardware.  Alternative is to provide Newco what it needs, get services back for gas and power and go dark on all remaining commodities (coal, etc.).

no idea - i got the impression a little more $ would do it.  He told me his mind is made up.  He appreciates the offer, but he wants to do structuring at a company that will have a lot of structuring stuff to do day 1 and will definitely be stable.  I told him to see you and have an open mind.

Jeff
The Amoco netting Agreement has been finalized and will be circulated for signature tomorrow as soon as I get execution sets from their attorney.  On the Coral side, the EEI and Guaranty issues have been agreed to and documentation will be executed no later than tomorrow.  My understanding from Harlan Murphy, a colleague of mine, is that Coral is NOT requiring the Netting Agreement in order to do the ring trades.

John L. suggested I pass of this request to you.  

As you work a deal for NewCo I wanted to make sure that we include the various tools we use in structuring for pricing and evaluating deals (i.e., we want to make sure the NewCo will have the exclusive rights to this information).  Kelli has provided a basic list of this information below.  Most relates to the exotica functions (and any associated code) that Research has created for structuring deals.  I am forwarding a copy of this to Jim Meyn to see if he has any additional needs.

Thanks.

We have offered re-employment to Dierdre McCaffrey and she has accepted effective today. We need to reinstate her back to December 5, 2001. Robert Jones is handling all needed paperwork,etc. Dierdre was in EGM-Freights Markets prior to being terminated on 12/03/01. Prior to EGM, she spent numerous years in various positions in wholesale gas structuring, trading, and origination. She was instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and negotiating most of our gas asset management transactions. She worked with Laura Luce and team on the Peoples' Gas transactions, and she will be critical in ensuring we maintain and optimize these contracts and positions going forward. She will be working with Laura Luce in the Enron Estate. 

Thank you.

Louise,

We highlighted the counterparties that we are currently working to reconcile margin amounts.  Other counterparties are listed for whom we might have differences, however in normal business practice we have established a mutual agreement on how to manage their account.  We will be in early in the morning, call us if you have any questions.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  Total Headcount at 874 and Total Bonus $s at 13,019,750 
Couple of things to note:
 Based on Zufferli sheet, I added 11 names to the Canada number but could not split btwn trading and orig
Probably need to verify Canda number with Milnthorpe.  I noticed Disturnal was not on the list.  Is that an error?
Did not see tax listed on Master cover sheet.  Tax would result in an add of 4 headcount and $220,000.
Portland had several changes adds in blue  

Please call with any questions.

750 total employees in Newco
Smaller phone switch, sized for 750 people organization
Email supported out of a larger corporation and not stand alone
No Help Desk, coverage from trading floor support techs
No 7x24 support, coverage for 5x12 (7am to 7pm)

Call with questions.  Thanks.   JR

...some bonuses this week (with some reclaw plus penalty), putting aside yourselves, the guys we already took care of, Colwell, Headicke, Beck and my people, is there anyone else in EA you would like to make a case to pay?

Plan today is to get these names and proposed numbers pulled together for Greg this evening. Plan was to ask Colwell, Headicke etc., separately, if you want to review their names I can let you see them later tonight.

I plan to sit over in old building (16.71) and do this this afternoon noon till 5pm. You can either call me on my cell or have Jeanie walk list across.

Hi Louise,

Gas is trading at the same pace as yesterday.  Power is almost as slow as yesterday, though.  That is particularly bad since yesterday we had the fire alarm in Portland.  Reliant is still going strong, despite yesterday's comments.

Any interest in taking a look at this?  If it is clean and NETCO can get it for $0.50 on the dollar and if they dont need to close for several weeks, it might be worth having Tycholiz look at it.

EES has been soliciting bids for some of its larger markets. (CA, IL, NY, OH, etc)  To date the bids have been dismal.  We are down to one player looking at one market and they are bidding $0.30 on the dollar. ($US)  These deals are clean and could be managed fairly easily by NETCo.  It might be a stretch, but this morning, management suggested we find out if NETCo can do some due dilligence at this time and determine if we want to bid on some of the book.  I am available at (713) 345 4441 if someone wants to discuss.

Ray,
The $958mm that Louise refers to on her slide is the sum of Sched C 09/27 ($667M) and Sched D 09/27 ($291M)..

The last schedule, 3Q01 Rolling Schedule C, is what we show Andersen, and includes EES Wholesale Sched C, which is not included in the schedules below (they're just North America). Please let me know if you need them and I'll try and track them down. 

Please call if you need any additional information. I'm  at x30352. Thanks!

Jeff / John,

We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals =
Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi=
ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und=
erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft=
er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co=
ncur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sh=
eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please =
let us know.

Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe Gold



Introduction

Enron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. =
 EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service=
s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining b=
rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i=
ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L=
ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato=
ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other b=
usinesses:
1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato=
ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus=
iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d=
isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.

2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst=
ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's p=
olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's cond=
uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship=
 to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th=
e FSA and the LME.

3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an=
d to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidi=
ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la=
ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co=
nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain =
prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi=
tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA =
regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc=
e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem=
ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be =
used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded =
as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ=
irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c=
ease carrying on business.

4)=09EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o=
versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for=
 a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines=
 and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members=
 under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r=
elating to directors' duties.

Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation

In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem=
onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng=
th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t=
he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation =
we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.

Issues Surrounding Liquidity

As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl=
ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th=
e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio=
n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the =
goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing =
of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t=
he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli=
shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp=
any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was=
 concerned =20

The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains=
 and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,=
 it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap=
ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its=
 day to day liquidity.=20
=20
In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp=
oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (=
LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater=
al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc=
ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and =
the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it=
 must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu=
al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre=
d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-=
money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th=
ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr=
ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest=
ions.

Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari=
os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce=
rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to =
fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from=
 the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l=
osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of c=
ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC'=
s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be=
 transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the re=
maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be =
withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid=
ity impact.

The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo=
r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have =
agreed to start to do the following
a.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid=
ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t=
he rest of the enterprise
b.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control=
 as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel
c.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints=
 of continuing to do business on a normal basis
d.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis
e.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a=
s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity
f.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi=
onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou=
r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis

Operational Risk =20

In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account=
s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash =
needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p=
ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca=
ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I=
f EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, =
it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco=
unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either=
 capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be=
 substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi=
ght create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much f=
aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.

Capital

As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and mu=
st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th=
at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan=
cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions=
 when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v=
iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo=
rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain=
s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer =
not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the=
 FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari=
se from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those =
violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga=
tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh=
t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM=
L's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily =
basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev=
el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces=
s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20

Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing

The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce=
narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML

1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte=
rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral=
 rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac=
count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME =
brokers
4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i=
nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca=
sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=20
5)=09Credit exposures leading to credit losses

Recommendations

The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following=
 changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov=
erall operational liquidity

1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s=
ubordinated facility
2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)
3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi=
ty by six months to July 2002
4)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi=
ts and other assets held by EML
5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch=
 to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol=
d for calling margin
6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th=
an a select group of key relationship clients=20
7)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c=
ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance


Current Situation

Unsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mm
Secured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mm
Subordinated Loans=09=09=09$107 mm
EML Cash Balance:=09=09=09$59 mm
Cash required to replace
Withdrawn guaranty=09=09=09($20mm)


EML Regulatory Capital Level:=09128%
Excess Reg. Capital over 110%:=09$30 mm

Conclusion

The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress test=
ing.
The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we w=
ould have liquidity issues.  Given these possible eventualities we would ur=
ge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to comple=
ting point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

Kalen/David-

What are the facts surrounding this process? Surely what is outlined below can't be accurate...if it is- we need to figure out what can be done to shorten the timeframe. Please respond directly to Sabra L. Dinari and copy me.

Thanks.

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

Subject:	Re-start/Integration Planning

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)

Louise,

I spoke to our contact at BMO and they confirmed the $11.25MM is due to us by the end of day Wed. Also mentioned they were awaiting to have off-setting discussions with John Arnold.  Let me know if I need to put another call into them Wed.

>From Kevin Presto:

Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.   I have added the additional columns everyone requested.   I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday.
 
With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following:
1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete
2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.

Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.

Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (Christi has started a list already).

The transmission agreement list attached can be used to prioritize or assign commercial people to transmission/pool agreements.  It is not correct on the timing under the pools, so don't rely on that column.

 

Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.

Raj Vaswani, the general counsel for Kiodex, called me to pass along two messages:

1.	If a new  joint venture is created to resurrect EnronOnline, Kiodex would be interested in pursuing a business relationship with the new joint venture.  I told him that it was much too early to predict whether this would be of interest to a new trading company, but I told him I would relay Kiodex's interest to you. 

2.	Kiodex may be interested in repurchasing the shares in Kiodex currently owned by Enron Net Works LLC.  He did not know what the price would be, but wanted to know if we would be interested.  Since Net Works is a filed company, we would probably have to get the bankruptcy court's approval to sell.   I assume that if the price is right we are interested in pursuing this.  Let me know.

Thanks, Anne

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.

Anne,

I received your voice mail. We are working with each vendor to assign the contracts or enter into new contracts as required in order to ensure that content is available on relaunch of the system.

Affected contracts are:

Intelligence Press - no agreement required.
Accuweather - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Dow Jones - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Reuters - working on new month-to-month contract with them.

We will work with Leslie on getting written consents.

Thanks,

Dave

Louise,

I think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions.  Bradford did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for aep, but now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash.  

If we are short np15 and we have an in the money sale to a muni that does not post collateral, we could sell that customer contract to cash-rich marketers - allegheny, duke, aep, dynegy

I know it is our core business, but it might be quicker than selling brazil. 

Target customers: munis, wapa, bpa,

With respect to the segregation of funds in Mexico to pay for potential labor liabilities as requested by John Lavorato, below is my proposed plan.

1 - We obtain a legal opinion from Mexican counsel explaining the legal obligation of any Mexican company to pay for labor liabilities and summarizing the possible liabilities for directors in case such liabilities are not paid for.

2-  The shareholders of Enron Servicios pass a resolution memorializing the desire to comply with Mexican law and resolving to open a segregated bank account to pay for any and all possible labor liabilities.  This bank account can only be accessed by any two directors of Enron Servicios signing jointly (this is my suggestion and can obviously be different).

3 - Our lawyers in Mexico will open the account and funds will be transferred forthwith.

4 - The resolution and the bank account will not be public record and no employee should know about these funds (we need to see how we can send funds to this bank account  without any Mexico employee's signature)

Purpose:  (i) Document our legal obligations in accordance with mexican law and the reason why the shareholders of the company wish to segregate funds and (ii) make sure nobody besides the directors can access these funds.  If the segregation of funds is ever challenged by ENE or ENA's creditors, we will have the legal background and justification for the segregation.

If this is okay with you, I will have the various resolutions and proxies ready for signature tomorrow and the account could probably be open and funded by Thursday.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.   Thanks

Note:  Lisa, I will fill you in tomorrow

Debbie/Bill - Enron Direct Canada Corp. (EES Canada) has 7 LCs expiring 12/31/01.  In order to continue serving current retail customers under existing contracts and adding new retail customers in Alberta, the security requirements will need to be met.  Enron Direct Canada Corp. has estimated what their requirements will be as of the time the LCs expire, and is outlined in the email below.  The total security requirement comes to approximately $6 million USD.  

The bank we now have the LCs with, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, has notified Enron Corp. Treasury that they will not renew the LCs.  Enron Corp. does not meet the credit requirements to provide a guaranty.  In order to continue to operate under these contracts in Alberta, it looks like our only alternatives at this point are to either provide new LCs or post cash.

At the end of November, we expect we will be requested to provide this security.  Please let us know what additional information you will need to consider this request for security.

At the time that the Enmax LC was put in place, Enmax would only accept Parental Guarantees from Companies with an "A " rating.  To my knowledge they have not lowered the threshold.

Theresa,

With respect to Enmax and credit requirements for a guarantor, there are no specific ratings thresholds in the legal documentation (Enmax' Terms and Conditions).  I will work with Kate to ascertain who in Enmax' credit department knows what these specific ratings thresholds are (if any).  Once done, either Kate or I will advise.

With respect to general processes surrounding holding cash at a Canadian bank, I know that Enron Canada's policy is to not take cash collateral by wire transfer into a bank account.  The primary reason for this policy involves risks associated with our Personal Property Registration System: to perfect a security interest in a wire transfer requires the registration of a financing statement (multi-jurisdictional, cumbersome); even with such registration one is not guaranteed priority. Again, this is Enron Canada's position with respect to cash collateral; I do not know why Enmax would not accept the C$600, but suspect that their reasons may be the same.  As far as the "process" of holding cash at a Canadian bank, I will speak with the relevant operations/credit person (perhaps Lori and/or Cheryl Dawes) and have them contact you.

Please let me know if you need further assistance with respect to this matter.

Derek

Darren et al - I have received and reviewed the info on each company's security requirements faxed to me from Leela and Derek.  What Derek had sent me is the same info that Mark Powell had sent me.  Based on what I have reviewed, the security amount required (approx total US$6,000,000) and acceptable forms of security are outlined below:

ATCO - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$450,000
Guaranty from A rated company
LC
Cash

Enmax (Calgary, Red Deer, Lethbridge) - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$1,850,000, C$75,000, C$65,000
Guaranty from guarantor that meets Enmax's credit requirements (it does not state what their credit requirements are)
LC
Cash

EPCOR - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$1,000,000
Guaranty from BBB+ rated company
Bank guaranty 
LC 
Cash held at Canadian Bank

Town of Ponoka - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$12,000
Guaranty from BBB+ rated company
Bank guaranty 
LC 
Cash held at Canadian Bank

Power Pool of Alberta - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$6,000,000
Bank guaranty
Letter of guaranty 
LC
Cash deposit drawn on Canadian Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council

Derek - please find out what Enmax's credit requirements are for a guarantor, as well as explain the process of holding cash at a Canadian Bank.  Previously, when we tried to post cash for a C$600 security requirement at Enmax (Calgary), they wouldn't accept it and required a Letter of Credit.  We need verification that posting cash is not a problem and we need to understand the process.  Once we have answers to these questions, we can determine how to proceed.

Thanks, Teresa

The current Bengalla purchase transaction for approximately $3.5mm is approved by credit and from a cash flow standpoint.  Please continue to approve transactions through credit.  However, for the most part we will treat the coal business, as business as usual.

George,

I would be happy to discuss with you.  It remains critical that we manage all cash requirements as our access to capital markets has been impacted over the past few weeks.  Hopefully the announcement on Friday will improve our ability to execute transactions like this in future, but prior to Friday this was a necessary precaution.  Unfortunately, you are working at a different company than you were a few weeks ago.

We can discuss next week.

Bill

The Bengalla deal was struck after I had given ECAP notice of the liquidity problems, and more importantly, without any RAC involvement.

>From a RAC perspective this deal is still unapproved.  If an invoice discount facility can be used, or some other means of performing without using Enron capital then you should move forward.  If these options are not available, then the issue should either be raised to Louise Kitchen for approval or unwound until the liquidity problems are resolved.

		John:

		I assume this does not apply to ECTRL business, as we have not been given a reciprocal recommendation for European biz.  Can you confirm this?  Also, can you clarify what the specific issue is with ECAP that is not an issue with ECTRL?  Is this specific to cash flow within Australian entities?

		Thanks,

		Stu

			In light of the current situation in Houston, I recommend we wait to finalize any physical coal sourcing or deliveries in the ECAP business.  In short, RAC cannot approve any purchase or sale until the liquidity issues are resolved.  Hopefully by the end of the week we will know more, have things settled, and business can continue as normal.

			Please call me if you have any questions.

Subject:=09Reps/Warranties

As we have discussed, we are not in a position to commit to convey all prop=
erties, assets, rights, etc. that are used in Enron's current business of t=
rading physical and financial natural gas and electricity and associated ri=
sk management products.  As the document is currently drafted, all items go=
, unless specifically excluded.  The danger to the estate is that, because =
the catch-all phrase is so broad, we know now that many items will not be i=
dentified, and then cannot be recovered.  The sellers will continue their b=
usiness, subject to the negotiated noncompete; however, most everything cou=
ld be deemed to be "used" in the business.  The requested reps/warranties a=
pply not just to the assets they are to receive, but to the business stated=
 above.  So they are, for example, demanding that we identify and list ever=
y employment and consulting agreement pursuant to which someone is performi=
ng services in the operation of the Business, and each contract with a term=
 of one year or more that has been made in connection with the Business, un=
less relating solely to identified excluded assets.  These constructs would=
 pick up literally thousands of other contracts - even confidentiality agre=
ements for example.

We propose the following solution:
1.  We have prepared a schedule of specific assets that should be transferr=
ed to Netco.
2.  We would give a sufficiency rep to assure the Buyer that the listed ass=
ets are all the material assets necessary for Netco to operate a business s=
imilar to the Business referenced above. We have communicated to the potent=
ial buyer that Netco would need to attain certain assets, and these would b=
e identified in writing in the rep.  For example, certain third-party licen=
ses, and some hardware items.
3.  The rep would have to be tailored to exclude certain items such as offi=
ce space.
4.  We would give negotiated reps on the specified Assets, and in limited, =
appropriate circumstances on the Business.  Other than the asset list, we w=
ould not list all of any specified requirement, but only necessary exceptio=
ns to the reps, as negotiated.
5.  We would give a broad "further assurance" covenant to provide, without =
further cost to Netco but subject to any required consents, anything that i=
s later identified as being appropriate for their conducting the business.
6.  We view this as an MBO type transaction involving the sale of assets, w=
hereby the people going to Netco know the underlying business best, and can=
 identify specifically the assets that should go, both for the contract to =
begin with, but also in a very short period of time post-closing (by using =
the further assurance clause).

After conversations with Kal Shah and Greg Piper, here is where we stand on the trade marks and domain names.
 
A.  Ownership of the following to be transferred to NewCo:
 
1.  Putting the energy into e-comerce
2.  One stop energy shop
3.  Pricedesk
4.  Pricedesk.com
5.  Retaildesk
6.  Retaildesk.com
7.  Trading Innovation
 
Note that there are trademark applications pending for 2 and 7 above, and 3-6 above are registered by Enron Europe.  The Sellers will agree to convey whatever rights they have in marks 2-7 above to NewCo but cannot guarantee that NewCo will ultimately own the marks.
 
B.  EnronOnline:  Seller will grant NewCo a limited license to use the EnronOnline trade mark and logo for a period running 6 months from the date of closing solely for the purpose of marketing the new site as a platform for wholesale gas and power trading in North America.
 
C.  EnronOnline.com/net/org:  Seller will agree to redirect from EOL to NewCo for 60 days after NewCo site is up and running (with a link back to EOL at the NewCo site) and for 120 days thereafter will provide a link on the EOL site to the NewCo site.  
 
D.  Enbank:  Kal proposed that NewCo own this mark, but Greg would prefer that the Estate retain this mark.
 
I will leave it to Tim and Greg to discuss this proposal from their end and then contact Kal and/or Dave Forster to discuss.  After you all have reached resolution, I would appreciate if both Greg and Kal could contact Roger Ross of Weil Gotshall (713/546-5018 or roger.ross@weil.com <mailto:roger.ross@weil.com>) directly to confirm the final disposition of marks and names. 
 
Please let Roger know who should receive drafts of the License Agreements relating to B and C above.  
 
Please do not hesitate to call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.

Leslie -- I have spoken to Dave Forster and we would like to update our request  from yesterday as follows.  Pls. forward this to Nancy Raber as well.
 
The ownership of the following mark should be transferred to NewCo.:
 
1.  Putting the energy into e-commerce:  Current Tagline for EnronOnline 

A one year usage license should be obtained for the following marks/domain names:
 
1.  EnronOnline:  Global Commodities Trading Platform 
2.  EnronOnline.com/net/org:  Global Commodities Trading Platform 
3.  Enbank:  Virtual Gas Storage Auction Product in Enron Europe
 
If possible, the ownership of following marks/domain names should be transferred to NewCo.  If it is too complicated/costly, you can leave this out.
 
1.  Electricitydesk 
2.  Electricitydesk.com 
3.  Energydesk 
4.  Energydesk.com 
5.  Gasdesk 
6.  Gasdesk.com

Nancy -- As per our conversation this evening, I am attaching the e-mail I had sent to Leslie Hansen.  I will contact Leslie  in the morning and determine what marks/domain names Enron will allow for inclusion in the deal.  I agree that if the new company is going to have a different name, it should be sufficient if Enron kept the EnronOnline marks/domain names, but allowed their use for certain period of time to the new company.  I also acknowledge your concern that granting use of the marks may be more complicated if they are owned by Enron Europe given that it's a separate entity.  We will need to work out this issue depending on which entity owns the marks.  I will work with Leslie to research this tomorrow.
 
With regard to the "nice to have" trademarks in the second list below, I know that most of the domain names are owned by Enron Europe, not Enron Corp.  I will research to see which entity owns the trademarks on them.  If the trademarks are owned by Enron Europe as well, we may forgo including them in the deal for now.
 
Please hold off any offers for trademarks/domain names your deal papers until I call to confirm our final position.  I plan to speak to Leslie and Dave Forster (head of EnronOnline) in the morning.  Thanks.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Jeff

I have been notified that TD Securities will be coming Wednesday morning for due diligence on NetCo.  They will arrive between 8 and 8:30am with a team of 9 people and plan on being here through Thursday night.   I will be coordinating things for them on the corp dev side.  Please let me know who your commercial coordinator is and the schedule for the first day presentations.  

The data room is currently located in ECN3371; however we are trying to find a room that would be more accomodating for such a large group.

I will send you the names and titles of TD's team as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Subject:	Getting A Deal Done

I recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now.  However, I feel that I currently don't possess the information that I would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in NewCo.  I will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what I have heard about structures so far.  Excuse me if I am off on any (or all) of my facts.  I am currently receiving mostly second-hand information from gas and power traders in Houston.

Here is the Citibank deal as I understand it:
Requirement to retain between 5 and 15 employees to do the deal.
Fund (at some unknown level) a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of the 800 NewCo people.
800 employees
$30 million of 1-Day 95% VAR
Total 2002 costs of approximately $300 million.
Bonus pool equals 20% of EBIT
Bonus paid out 75% in cash and 25% in restricted stock with a 3-year cliff vest.

Here are my concerns
The cost structure appears to be well above what a $30 million VAR trading operation can support.
My recollection from west power ROVAR is roughly 90% in 1998, 120% in 1999, and close to 200% in 2000 and 2001.  I'm not sure how to handicap expected future ROVAR, but without additional information from the two of you I have a hard time expecting more than 100% in a lower-priced commodity market.  Given that assumption, the $30 million one-day VAR becomes $480 million annualized VAR gives you gross margin of $480 million.  I don't know what the capital and credit charges will be, for arguments sake let's call it $30 million.  Bonus pool equals $480-$30-$300=$150*20%=$30 million of which $22.5 is cash and $7.5 equity.  I can't sign up for that math.  Please help me understand how/why my math is wrong.
I need to understand our cost structure in great detail.  We need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level.  If I look at West Power (everyone in Portland) assume that we have 80 people with an average of $200,000 for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of $16 million.  Add on another $4 million for rent, parking, travel and entertainment ... and call it $20 million of direct expenses here.  I figure that we can make $100 million in 2002 with lower VAR and starting up later in the year.  How much of the $280 million remaining costs should I expect to be allocated to the West Power desk.  With an EBIT of $80 million times 20% I can sell.  If we have another $50 million of allocated costs then I can sell this.
I recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk EBIT.  However, I think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk EBIT and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that.

Proposed Retention Structure for Three People in Portland
A dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years.  Price tag tbd.
Create certainty around the bonus/retention payments.
Indemnify against payback of deferred comp.
Clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the desk.
15% of gross margin for 2002.  20% of EBIT going forward.

Other Gripes
Labor has not been invited to the negotiating table.
Labor doesn't get to see the pro forma.
We are supposed to get paid based on EBIT yet I have no control over the expense side or the allocation side.
Labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating.
Labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn't appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure.

I want to make this thing work.  I am not trying to be greedy.  I am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that I have been given.

Tim

Louise,

I asked Tammie to call the presenters to make sure of their availability.  I also talked to Mari and she is trying to find a bigger room given the size of this group.  She indicated that approximately half the group will review documents and the other half will participate in the presentations.

Louise,

Attached is a list of the contact people that were used during NetCo's phase I due diligence.  I understand that you and John Lavarato may want to funnel questions and data requests from bidders through a smaller group of people.  Can you please let me know if you would like to make any changes to this list?  Suzanne Vann and I will be responsible for taking bidders' requests and getting the appropriate contact person to meet with them.

Thank you,
Mari

What does margin based on average of MTM?  If we have agreed an average mark - what is their number?  Are these just the counterparties we margin/have a collateral threshold with?

Louise,

We highlighted the counterparties that we are currently working to reconcile margin amounts.  Other counterparties are listed for whom we might have differences, however in normal business practice we have established a mutual agreement on how to manage their account.  We will be in early in the morning, call us if you have any questions.

Louise,

Here's what we've got. This list of MTM values is based on a list of prepay deals #'s from Greg Whiting and shows value as of COB 22 Nov 01.

Global Finance has the rest of the details we need to complete the picture. 

Give me a call if you need more.

I thought more about our phone conversation last night.  Based on what you said and assuming this document is ok, count me in.  Sorry my reaction was not as positive as you hoped but your comment about not being able to discuss who is on the team with anyone caught me off guard.  I don't believe I have any issues with financial terms that you said (again I want to see what it looks in writing).  I still don't fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 50% of the commercial people is all that we end up, this shop will still be better than any other on the street.  I guess get me this document to look at when ever you can.  

Thanks,

Tom

The distribution has been created - DL-NETCO.  However, is it possible for me to ask Tammie to enter all the names?  The HR generalists are meeting with all of the department heads to make sure that we communicate to their employees that they have been identified for NETCO so we are a bit short of resources this morning.

Thanks - 
Amy

That's pretty scary given that they are in default everywhere else in the

good standing and compliance mean???

Subject:	Update on SRP Margin Call
Importance:	High

Tim,

As you know, SRP made a margin call to EPMI on Monday, by letter, seeking $5.5 million in margin under a "one-off" contract.  Tracy and I sent a letter back on Tuesday, arguing that the contract does not permit SRP to call for additional margin unless ENE is downgraded to junk status.  SRP responded to our letter this afternoon.  Predictably, SRP disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin.  SRP says that it will treat our failure to post $5.5 million by Monday, November 12, in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit, as an event of default and will terminate the contract.  If this happens, EPMI would have to make a payment of $5.5 million within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from SRP.

As you know, Tracy and I strongly believe that the contract does not support SRP's right to call for margin at this time.  However, the contract is not perfect (they drafted it, after all) and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position.  

I recommend that we treat the SRP-EPMI dispute regarding the margining criteria under this Agreement as a "Dispute" under Section 17.  Disputes are first submitted to Authorized Representatives (each company designates an Authorized Representative) to resolve.  If the Authorized Representatives cannot reach agreement within 30 days, then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at SRP (the "Executives").  The Executives have to meet within 30 days to resolve the issue.  If the Executives cannot resolve the issue within 30 days, then both parties can choose arbitration, or either party can take the matter to court.  In summary, best case, this option gets us up to 90 days before we have to arbitrate/litigate the issue.  Otherwise, we better prepare to post collateral Monday.

If you want to handle this matter by taking the "Dispute" route, I should send a letter out tomorrow to SRP giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract's "Dispute" provisions.

Steve

(I should also mention that Tracy has informed me that SRP plans to issue a margin call on our WSPP contracts (approximately $4.5 million) as soon as it calculates the amount due.)

Revised again - commercial count down to 47.  Tim has file on its way that includes comm support.  The total Portland number is 73 (commercial and support) vs current operation of approx. 120.  

Who controls master list (s) for commercial and support?

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Umbrella is still requiring this type of information to be scheduled.  Although our position is currently not to provide it, we may alter the position and I am trying to get a head start since the time frames are shortening.  They will eventually want this on all counterparties, but we can start with the top twenty.  Further, early next week Andy Alter wants to discuss how we will contract initially.  Mark Taylor and I will discuss this with him, but it will be vital to have contact information ready sooner rather than later.  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Confirmed w mark taylor. Without the language on assignment in the lc, if you move the underlying trades to a permitted affiliate, the lc would not follow. So the language does have value.

Given the events of the past week and the creation of the Enron North America Estate team (which you are a critical part of) there will be a meeting held today, Monday, December 10.  The intent of the meeting is to gather the whole team together, update everyone on our mandate and our go forward plans, and address your questions. 

There will be a follow-up email shortly with the exact time and location of the meeting.

Jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue. Under Australian Law the Directors of ECAPPL need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid. Failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt. If the Coal Group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments   then that is the obvious way forward. One of the Coal Group in the Sydney office (presumably Paul McPhee) could replace Heidi Mason as resident director.

We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

Thks
Jez

It has been made clear to me that Jeff Shankman needs to clear this transaction through Bill Bradford and Louise Kitchen prior to any capital going out the door.  It is my understanding that this has not been done.

George:

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

Came up to the 6th floor to see you a little after 5:00 today, but it was very quite on 6.  Sorry that I missed you.   I had earlier delivered to Mary Cook 5 binders of operational information for EA.  Brought my copy by just to show you what we had put together.  Mary is planning to e-mail you the index list from the binders.  The binders are well-organized, color-coded and filled with information that appropriately addresses the controls and operational reporting that are used in managing the gas and power business.  

I will take my copy home with me over the weekend so that I can address any questions that may come up.  We expect to substitute a more updated version of our cash collections process flow on Monday, assuming that Leslie Reeves has returned from jury duty.  She apparently has the "prettier" version of the process flow, but has been tied up fullfilling her civic duty.  -Sally

Tomorrow is the final day to schedule December barrels, and we are currently short 1,220,000 barrels.  We have exhausted all measures of buying crude including: settling sales financially, buying from companies where we have short positions, and selling physical puts.  As a group, we have reduced our short physical position from over 10 million barrels to 1.2 under extremely difficult credit terms.  We believe we cannot cover the remaining 1.2 without prepaying a counterparty.  This requires a cash infusion of approximately $22,631,000 (1,220 X $18.55/barrel). 

Every effort will be made within the next 24 hours to reduce this position, but the outlook is not bright.  Please let me know as soon as possible what can be made available to us.

Sincerely,

Rob Fuller

Subject:Information on Trading Book

In order to advance the dialogue on any structures which involve taking
risk to
the trading business, we'll need to start out with the following
information.
I was hoping you could communicate this to the company.   Jeff had
previously
requested some of this; but we haven't gotten anything.  If you know of
people
internally who have some of the information, we can get it from them;
although
it's kind of important that all the information is recent and from the same
(or
very close) date.

1.  Break down of the balance sheet positions(unrealized gains and
unrealized
losses) by trading book and product type.

2. List of UG/L of largest counterparties on both the UG and UL side
(hopefully
20-30% of cpties make up 70-80% of UG/L)

3.  Break out balance sheet by type of contract (ISDA vs other contracts).

4.  Risk positions/sensitivities based on their standard units of
measure/methodologies; eg,
- price sensitivities
- vol sensitivities
- VAR
- stress tests

5.  Historical P&L statements for each trading book (monthly) going back
2yrs.

6.  Analysis of collateral/margin provisions.  How much currently posted.
What
happens with downgrades/upgrades.


Jeff - have I missed or misstated anything?

We shld discuss how it would be best to go through the info (over the
phone, we
go there, they come here, etc).  But first step is having them pull it
together; or tell us what they can/will provide.

Thanks a lot.

Andrew

Contains all of the fundamental analysis and application.   The fundamental analysis/databases contains documentation of all the process and applications we use.

m:electric directory & power2 directories
This directory contains the some of our trading information and regional data.  A directory under this one call swapco has been created and a all key apps used by traders that were on their hard drives and home directories have been moved here.
This directory also hosts the traders models, position managers, one off spreadsheets and custom databases.

Louise,

Just a thought - I think our pr people and outside law firm should stop refering to netco as a joint venture - it hurts our ability to get commercial and regulatory agreements in place.

Attached are people who have been slated for the new company but have been terminated in the system (are not on the payroll).
Do you want these people to be called?  And if so what do you want communicated to them.

Thanks,

Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "Adequate Assurances of Payment", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.

This is from Reliant's Cheif Risk Officer.  Please speak with Presto about facilitating these trades.  Also, Badeer was trying to ring positions out with MS and AEP and I told him not to do anything with AEP.

We have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3-way offset transactions. Much appreciated. Even today in the west. But I don't think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity. Pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won't even discuss. We are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all. I have informed our traders to be o
pen to such opportunities, but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. That's why the interaction of your traders is vital. There are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot. Hope you can help.

I also just got a writeup of a potential new 4-year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your EES supply desk. I am reviewing now. Of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure, so making room in other areas makes so much sense.

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=
c. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

Business
Briton who took trading online
Rupert Steiner

12/02/2001
Sunday Times - London
Final 1

(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)

   ENRON'S fastest-rising star was a British mother-of-two. Anonymous
in the UK, Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old former Powergen manager,
made her name with the audacious manner in which she set up the power
company's online trading arm, writes Rupert Steiner. It paid off and
her story is used as a case study in management schools throughout
America.

   In just seven months, Kitchen, president and chief operating
officer of EnronOnline, enabled the web-based trading of natural gas
in North America after developing the idea and progressing it to days
before launch without seeking board approval.
   She joined the company in London in the spring of 1994 and was
responsible for building its natural gas trading business in Europe.

   A self-confessed loudmouth, she established a reputation for being
larger than life. She is certainly no shrinking violet - her
colleagues describe her as blunt, pushy and inspiring.

   Her career took off one April morning in 1999. She was in a taxi
on her way to Heathrow airport, bound for a large gas-processing
plant in Teesside.

   John Sherriff, managing director of Enron Europe, and Greg
Whalley, Enron's chief gas trader in Houston, called and asked if she
would prepare some research on trading gas contracts online.

   She spotted the opportunity and set out to do more than just
review Enron's options for online trading. She enlisted the support
of Enron's sceptical top traders and scoured the company for software
developers and other experts.

   Her volunteers worked nights and weekends while carrying on with
their regular jobs. Kitchen did not attempt to get corporate approval
or seek permission to change the way the company traded, she simply
presented the project as a fait accompli a few weeks before it went
live.

   It was a huge risk but one which was credited with the remaking of
the company. By mid-summer 2000 it had revolutionised the energy-
trading business, notching up more than $1 billion in average daily
trading transactions and lifting Enron's sales by 75% in the second
quarter. It raised Enron's market value by billions of dollars.

   She has been promoted seven times in five years and is listed in
Fortune league table of the world's most powerful women. Her future
now looks uncertain.

There seems to be some confusion around who will own the intellectual property for the treasury workstation application.  It was Mary's and my understanding that the IP would remain with the estate and a license would be given to Netco to use the application.  Jay was under the impression that the IP was to be transferred to Netco.  Could someone please clarify.  

The estate (Mary Perkins) would like the IP to remain with the estate.  If this is a problem - please call Mary directly.

Thanks,
Beth

That is great news.  We are still pressing the lawyers to see if the Enron rep letter can be signed today or in the near future.  That way we can issue under the WLB committed LC line.

Hopefully once the bank meeting concludes on Friday, some of these guys may be more amenable to us using some of the uncommitted LC capacity we have unused at this time.

Cheers,

JR

All,

Barclays has agreed to accept cash collateral on an ongoing basis until such time we are able to post an L/C subject to the provisions stated below. 

Under the circumstances, I think that they have been very flexible and would be unlikely to negotiate on most of the points. We would need some clarification on point 1 (onerous if it applies to all contracts under the current ISDA), we would expect 1. to only apply to SO2 transactions (written into the SO2 confirm).

Vincent, Brent, I would be grateful if you would take at a look at these points. Our timeline is to get everything signed by 1pm today.

Regards

Soma

	Points needed to get credit sign-off
	
	1. Failure to pay in all documentation, reduced from 3 days to 1 day
(as per 2001 new ISDA amendment)
	2. Fix dates (if needed) on all master SOX documentation. (call me
to discuss this point further)
	3. Early termination language with regard to effected party needs to
be amended on the confirms
	4. Document waiver regarding failure to deliver L/C and subsequent

	5. Guarantees being checked, awaiting view from my legal team.

Basically, this acquisition puts NRG's interest up to 65%; NSP owns 64% of NRG but has 90% of the voting shares.  If you count the 64% ownership, NSP is below 50% and OK.  If you consider the 90% then NSP is over 50% and the QF is bust.

Our counsel (LaBeuf) didnot see a problem with this, but apparently they are the only firm that will give a good opinion.  The bank's counsel has set up an informal FERC meeting.  If the FERC staffers nod approval - we can get it done.  If not, we have a probem. Our original solution to this potantial problem was to sell them the loan, but this looks a little difficult for NRG to swallow in light of our now infamous innovative financing structures.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary
Portland
San Francisco
Chicago
Denver

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards,
Tammy

***********************************************************************

The collapse of the proposed Enron/Dynegy merger has sent a shock wave through
the industry but does not threaten the effective functioning of wholesale gas
and power markets in North America. Major market participants have had more
than a month to unwind positions with Enron, and thus the overall exposure has
been greatly reduced.

*  Wholesale gas and power markets in North America continue to function
effectively. There is no reason for the physical flow of gas or power to be
impeded this winter.

*  Liquidity for longer-term structured products has temporarily been reduced.
Others will move in to fill the gap, but this will take time.

*  Enron's problems do not represent a critical blow to deregulating gas and
power markets.

We are sending this Alert to Global Energy clients also because of Enron's
major role in the US gas and power markets.

Apparently, two things are happening.  One is that the perception is that the metals business won't survive the merger and people are closing positions.  Simultaneously, there is something going on in the copper market which is pushing volatility way up.  I'm told we got run over there.

Our most important, non-top 20 counterparty in the west is pacificorp (the utility, not ppm).  Pacificorp is the most important counterparty for both our short term northwest an short term southwest desks.  As we allocate scarce margin, please keep this in mind.

Jan,
Here is the breakout of margin.  We are still working with some of the other business units (EGM, EIM, and Europe) to further breakout their origination.  I will forward this schedule again after we get this detail.

Thanks,

Following up on Elizabeth Sager's conversation with you Corry as to terminated wholesale power contracts and related matters, and based also on EPMI's obligation to preserve assets for the bankruptcy estate, EAST Wholesale Power's scheduling of energy receipts and deliveries in Cinergy, ComEd, PJM, Entergy and NEPOOL and any other eastern markets should be halted following the close of business today, excepting those scheduling activities in NEPOOL required in order to perform the contracts in effect between EPMI and UI, NSTAR, Central Maine, and Vermont, respectively.  

If explanation is requested by our upstream counterparties, please respond that we are unable to receive due to the actions of our downstream parties (e.g., they're not taking, so we are unable to take).  If explanation is requested by downstream counterparties, please respond that we are unable to supply due to the actions of our upstream parties (e.g., they're not delivering, so we're not able to deliver).  Please contact me or Elizabeth Sager if there are questions relating to this change in our scheduling activities.

Please continue to take notes/ preserve a record of your scheduling communications.

It has been our understanding (credit area, both companies) that Enron must
prepay for all its purchases including all forward positions ever since
Enron was downgraded to BBB minus.  Unfortunately for Enron Canada Corp., I
cannot convince my Board nor my Bank to do otherwise.

Enron will still get interest from pre-payments that have not been used to
pay for gas that has already been delivered and invoiced.

With the above in mind, here is the current status:
					CAD$
$ carried forward from yesterday 		   2,725,000
Today's purchases			(14,225,000)	large part of which is Dec gas
Today's wire				   8,000,000 	which incidentally has not arrived as yet
Balance	(short)				  (3,500,000)

Jason, kindly
*	please followup with your Treasury area to see where CAD$8mm is?
*	please, for today's value date, arrange to send another CAD$3.5mm plus
whatever $$ your traders need for tomorrow?
*	your Calgary traders have another 30TJs of room for day gas at time of
writing this email (purchases so far today 3,660TJs).  Once the 30TJs is
filled, you will be halted.

We thank you for your co-operation.

As a reminder to our discussions last week on Rawhide - there was a $300 MM cap related to Letters of Credit as follows:

ENE and Principal Subsidiareis are prohibited from the following

(i)	The mandatory, accelerated or scheduled repayment of any Indebtedness of Enron or its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined in the Enron Revolver) after November 21, 2001 other than (w) accrued and unpaid interest on such Indebtedness, (x) up to $55,000,000 in respect of maturing commercial paper notes of Enron Corp., (y) up to $130,000,000 in respect of maturing commercial paper notes of Enron Funding Corp. and (z) reimbursement obligations in respect of letters of credit issued for the account of Enron and its Subsidiaries (subject to the cap specified below) to the extent not renewed

(ii)	The voluntary prepayment of any Indebtedness of Enron or its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined in the Enron Revolver),

(iii)	The incurrence of any Lien after November 21, 2001 to secure any Indebtedness of Enron or its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined in the Enron Revolver) other than (x) Liens on cash at any one time to secure reimbursement obligations in respect of existing or future letters of credit issued for the account of Enron and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business (subject to the cap specified below), (y) Liens required under the NNG Revolver and the Transwestern Revolver and (z) Permitted Liens, or

The aggregate amount of cash repaid under clause (iv)(z) and cash subject to Liens under clause (vi)(x) shall not exceed $300,000,000.

James - can you keep track of this related to the work you are doing on the L/C's.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,


George

Louise

Saw in the WSJ today that the judge allowed Enron to "end" 600-700 supply
contracts. Is that EES? If so are they going to still be in business? I ask
because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve-out. Is there
anything left to carve out??

Thanks

Rick

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=
ty --- Firm Will Pay Debt, Keep Cash Cushion

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump
By Theo Francis and Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=
al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount=
s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea=
r.=20
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=
n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the =
start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=
 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =
in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire=
d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=
 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi=
ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L=
ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, =
he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=
icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=
y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =
insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=
r option exercises.=20
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =
should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=
ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=
vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=
g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =
the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=
old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=
.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=
hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron=
's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=
 company and Mr. Fastow.=20
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=
, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=
 on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=
te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=
nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston=
, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose=
 problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th=
e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s=
uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil=
lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=
dit-Rating Concerns

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=
 amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =
issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=
 the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=
rop during the past two weeks.=20
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=
 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=
lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=
e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=
rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=
eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=
spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=
e B or lower.=20
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=
 late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=
ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =
investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=
terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=
onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=
cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=
 troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20
"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=
vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=
.J.=20
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=
elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=
- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=
e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=
ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=
cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=
pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=
rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=
 the noninvestment-grade level.=20
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=
le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=
ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=
tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=
g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=
inancial flexibility.)=20
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=
 the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=
tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =
independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed=
 yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=
ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=
ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=
 make good on its commitments.=20
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=
r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =
the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=
y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a=

Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=
 little about.=20
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic=
s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n=
ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f=
or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=
ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=
ure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=
d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=
ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=
ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =
bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=
ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=
rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =
it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20
"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =
. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =
it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=
ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =
lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20
"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=
 black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =
who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=
ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =
when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=
evel of trust."=20
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=
ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=
 on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.=
=20
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=
ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=
es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=
t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=
ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=
 issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=
y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =
and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=
ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=
e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.=
=20
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=
ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=
 level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=
 stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =
to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=
h not strongly.=20
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=
ll" rating on Enron.=20
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=
es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=
ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=
d.=20
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=
apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=
icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=
es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=
ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=
d other revenue.=20
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=
r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=
on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=
, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20
"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=
 hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=
, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=
ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20
He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=
e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=
vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=
n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=
erformed."=20
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=
 calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=
sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=
ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=
s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=
es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=
lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =
he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=
e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=
s an industry leader.=20
"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=
tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =
their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =
to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=
nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=
 financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron=
's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=
 "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=
d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20
"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=
 prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =
in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =
as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=
k doesn't have much further to fall.=20
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=
, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of=
 research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=
n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=
. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=
 news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=
t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =
analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=
nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=
mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=
 are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=
, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=
der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=
" she says.=20
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she=
 asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not=
 an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=
 of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's=

Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enro=

Corporate US on track for bailout
DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 1=
8bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app=
roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.=20
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year=
s, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by =
the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amen=
dment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour cor=
porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and=
 Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt "new deal", prefer to see i=
ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects.=20
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on=
 Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn =
to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying l=
ittle or no tax.=20
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative=
 minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid=
 all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be mad=
e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded.=20
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul=
ate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone,=
 while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll=
ars 671m.=20
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's thi=
rd largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United=
 Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy=
 - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced t=
o sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m.=20
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis=
like other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capi=
tal investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They =
say these amount to a "giant corporate giveaway".=20
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h=
elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs=
 and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely t=
o start in the new year.=20
"Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner =
down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of wo=
rking families," the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of Cali=
fornia, said.=20
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's=
 provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Do=
llars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of st=
ates.=20
* A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world =

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=
 and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =
is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=
ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =
reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=
is predecessor.=20
>From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =
respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=
y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =
doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=
en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt=
's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=
on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=
o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=
 could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =
fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=
estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=
an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=
counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=
mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=
ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=
te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=
. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=
o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=
re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=
n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=
, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=
ments and restatements.''=20
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=
d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=
gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =
a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=
 who try to resist misleading accounting.=20
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =
that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=
tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=
t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=
t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=
g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=
n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=
th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=
.=20
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=
ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=
es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=
ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=
rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=
ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=
ey," he wrote.=20
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =
(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=
 have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=
00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=
d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=
ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=
% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =
UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=
es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=
ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=
ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=
. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=
nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=
me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=
ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=
forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=
 the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=
nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=
haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=
r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=
r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=
perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=
gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=
he federal government.=20
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =
bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =
same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=
nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=
mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =
following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =
Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =
company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =
reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=
vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =
of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=
dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=
ence.=20
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=
nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=
ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =
day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,=
 Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=
ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=20
4. Gold Diggers=20
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=
, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. Accordin=
g to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty preci=
ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, =
with net inflows of $101 million.=20
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, dur=
ing the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion.=
 But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew=
orthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long.=20
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of =
a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=
08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=
mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody=
's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =
period, they were up 7.13%.=20
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades=
 -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =
seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in=
 prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Se=
pt. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will co=
nfront disappointment once again.=20
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become pro=
fitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma oper=
ating profit.=20
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in lon=
g-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit=
 is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningle=
ss aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn a=
n economic profit.=20
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announci=
ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren =
Jenson added the humble qualifier, "There are no guarantees." Amazon simult=
aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that s=
ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago=
.=20
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slig=
htly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core =
books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made p=
rogress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses =
have decreased by 20% over the past year.=20
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made th=
e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% =
from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an=
d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from prev=
ious buy ratings. "We thought there might be upside to our estimates," note=
d Blodget. "There wasn't."=20

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled=
 the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pa=
ir of grim economic reports.=20
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly=
 well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from=
 Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in th=
ird-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversi=
ng an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29,=
 to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99=
.=20
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the=
 fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in re=
cent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good=
 news regarding individual companies.=20
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raise=
d its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarde=
d the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several o=
ther parts of the energy sector along with it.=20
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed =
its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from=
 within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69.=20
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 4=
4 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-s=
torage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54.=20
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measu=
re also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a =
$100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrori=
st attacks on the economy.=20
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily o=
n the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American Int=
ernational Group and WorldCom.=20
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth=
 consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 perc=
ent dip many analysts had forecast.=20
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americ=
ans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, t=
he second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally a=
ssociated with recessions.=20
Other Indicators=20
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the Ame=
rican Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2=

* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where =
trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday.=
 On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and vol=
ume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion.=20
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, =
and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday.=20
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York t=
rading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and =
a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents.=20
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, =
up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available=
 bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt=
h and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 bill=
ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi=
ng to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide=
 a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks =
about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the mov=
es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit=
y should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f=
ew days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," sa=
id an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief fin=
ancial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we=
 are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than =
adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme=
nts."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's=
 largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec=
tricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved i=
n about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has report=
ed a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity =
of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di=
d with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch=
, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors chang=
ed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Servic=
e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall =
below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several no=
tches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, E=
nron shares were down six cents at $16.35.=20

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its pro=

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest =
natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto ba=
rometer of health within the energy trading sector.=20
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on=
 the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, execu=
tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and fre=
e-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector.=
 They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolatio=
n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
"The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was =
yesterday, a week ago or a month ago," said Jim Donnell, president of Duke =
Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and tr=
ades power.=20
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In=
c., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday,=
 when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i=
ts rivals.=20
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 p=
ercent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim=
e soon.=20
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning=
s, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n=
ot entirely forthcoming only got worse.=20
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnersh=
ips managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. =
That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off=
 an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow=
, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence.=20
"They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test=
 and they didn't come through with flying colors," said Christopher Ellingh=
aus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York.=20
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have=
 little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts =
for roughly 80 percent of profits.=20
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa=
ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices.=
=20
"Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is sti=
ll sound and not likely to disappear," Ellinghaus said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment.=20
"The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is o=
verdone," Barone said.=20
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income o=
f $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million =
in profits.=20
"It's business as usual," said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.=20
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when =
its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The dow=
nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from =
power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter,=
 taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses,=
 troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earne=
d $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep=
t. 30.=20
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesd=
ay because of "dire" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that=
 it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r=
eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy.=20
"All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality," Ellin=
ghaus said.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.=20
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying clo=
se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o=
f receivables not being paid.=20
"They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to=
 credit," he said. "They've never missed a deadline."

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =

"It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out=
 there in the market now," Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie Jame=

The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Sing=

Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U=

ees.=20
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices.=
=20
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that inter=
national bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market.=20

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=
g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=
e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=
out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the=
 company signed with the state earlier this year.=20
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =
compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=
nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=
ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=
ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =
power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of=
 the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this=
 week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=
o Enron.=20
"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=
sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,=
 Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=
reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=
lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=
le money.=20
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=
te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars=
 of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=
 those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=
an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20
"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=
racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=
o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there=
 are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =
happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=
rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=
ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=
ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=
ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=
t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=
, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=
ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=
ough 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w=
on't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.=20

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp=
oration

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko=
droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=
 United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D=
ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (N=
YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=
f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=
r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =
class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, th=
at acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The P=
rivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume th=
at the class member(s) with the "largest financial interest" in the outcome=
 of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discre=
tion in determining which class member(s) have the "largest financial inter=
est," and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both ab=
solute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained =
substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please cont=
act Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. at classaction@srk-law.com for a more =
thorough explanation of the Lead Plaintiff selection process. If you have r=
elatively small losses, your ability to participate in any recovery will be=

 at this time.=20

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit t=
o provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion.=20
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has "more than adeq=
uate" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and =
it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain it=
s long-term credit rating.=20
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook f=
or Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in=
 market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair =
plans to rebuild the balance sheet.=20
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative =
news from the company.=20
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.=
35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Averag=
e daily volume is 7,832,606 shares.=20
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, re=
sulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminati=
ng certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed=
 by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediatel=
y.=20

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe En=
ron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock.=20
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks,=
 much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 di=
sclosure of the $1.01 billion charges.=20
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage po=
ints above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3=
 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-gra=
de credit, that kind of "spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with=
 a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said.=20
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downg=
rade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this wee=
k.=20
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have conc=
erns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in poli=
cy concerning the company.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they have=
n't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about =
a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets.=20
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with=
 rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.=

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

West Power is starting to prepare for marketing/contracting for Netco - basically coming up with the following:

Target lists:
- National dealer - Duke, Williams, etc.
- Strong regional - Pacificorp, BPA, etc.
- Customer - City of Santa Clara

Contract Debate:
- Wish list of modifications by customer
- Copy existing agreements or come up with clean new template?

Customer Message:
- What do we tell them now?
- What do we tell them when we are up and running?


Questions: Do you want me to start looking after the East?  If so, should I call Duran?  Presto? If I am in Houston next week I can meet with the team.

Thought: The most important counterparties are the big dealer/marketers that will want to have a physical gas, physical power and ISDA agreement.  Do we want me to help coordinate any of this across other groups?  Sager and I are thinking through this on power - I'm not sure where gas is.

The Rise and Fall of Enron

11/02/2001
The New York Times
Page 24, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Earlier this year, most companies would have loved to have Enron's problems=
. Californians resented the energy trading company's huge profits during th=
eir energy crisis, and Democrats in Washington raised questions about Enron=
's influence within the White House and about the cozy relationship between=
 Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and Vice President Dick Cheney. Nobody seem=
ed better positioned to thrive during the Bush presidency than this Houston=
-based apostle of deregulation.=20
Wall Street was impressed with Enron's strategy of swooping into formerly r=
egulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas, electricity or unused=
 telecom bandwidth. The company was celebrated as a paragon of American ing=
enuity, a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high-=
tech clearinghouse in an ever-expanding roster of markets. Enron's push to =
force utilities into the Internet age with its online trading systems, at a=
 seemingly handsome profit, became an epic tale of the dot-com revolution.
It now appears that Enron's tale may be more cautionary than epic. Enron en=
vy has crashed, along with the company's stock price, as serious questions =
emerge about its bookkeeping. Enron disclosed earlier this month that $1.2 =
billion in market value had vanished as a result of a controversial deal it=
 entered into with private partnerships run by its chief financial officer,=
 Andrew Fastow.=20
Most alarming was Enron's reluctance to shed light on management's wheeling=
 and dealing. ''Related-party transactions,'' as the accountants call them,=
 are fraught with conflicts of interest. Though much remains to be learned =
about these transactions, their scope and lack of transparency suggest that=
 Enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some=
 of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading. The extent to whic=
h company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear.=20
Enron has scrambled to dampen Wall Street's concerns, acknowledging its cre=
dibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses. On W=
ednesday it brought in William Powers, the dean of the University of Texas =
School of Law, to review the transactions. The Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission has launched its own formal investigation. Mr. Fastow was forced to =
resign, following Jeffrey Skilling, the man credited with driving Enron int=
o new cutting-edge businesses, out the door.=20
Enron's former admirers on Wall Street, mindful of recent scandals involvin=
g high-profile companies doctoring their earnings, and of the spectacular c=
ollapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, are alarmed=
. Carole Coale of Prudential Securities summed up the prevailing sentiment =
when she told The Times: ''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to rec=
ommend an investment when management does not disclose facts.'' Analysts, a=
s well as the media, are not entirely blameless. Enron did mention, albeit =
in passing, the troubling related-party deals as early as March 2000. But f=
ew analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company's revenu=
es, profits and stock price were soaring.=20
Harvey Pitt, the new Securities and Exchange Commissioner, must pursue the =
Enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as =
vigilant as his predecessor, Arthur Levitt, when it comes to protecting the=
 integrity of financial markets. Indeed, even if Enron is cleared of any wr=
ongdoing and regains some of its past luster, as it well might, the company=
 that preaches the merits of self-regulating marketplaces has reminded us a=
ll of the need for a strong regulator on Wall Street.

The Enron Debacle
Byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit's credibility
Executives at high-flying Enron Corp. (ENE ) never seemed overly concerned =
with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices. Earlier thi=
s year, the California Attorney General had to get a court order to collect=
 documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing. And w=
hen an analyst challenged former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling in a conference ca=
ll to produce Enron's balance sheet, Skilling called him an "ass----." Stil=
l, even some Enron executives worried that the company had gone too far wit=
h two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge i=
nvestments. With Enron's then-chief financial officer acting as general man=
ager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their=
 investments, the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from in=
vestors seemed overwhelming. "Internally, everybody said this is not a good=
 idea," says a source close to the company.

But no one could have predicted such a jaw-dropping outcome for the nation'=
s largest and most innovative energy trader. Since Oct. 16, when Enron reve=
aled a $35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnershi=
ps and was forced to knock $1.2 billion off its shareholders' equity, the c=
ompany's stock has plunged 60%. The Securities & Exchange Commission is inv=
estigating Enron's accounting for its partnerships and whether it properly =
disclosed them to investors.

Suddenly the company, which brought high-tech and complex finance to energy=
 trading, is essentially trying to avoid a run on the bank. Moody's Investo=
rs Service has already downgraded the company's debt. Enron says it is meet=
ing with credit agencies to calm their fears, and analysts say Enron is wor=
king on a turnaround plan that would likely include accelerating asset sale=
s, issuing shares, and obtaining new credit lines. Enron's board has set up=
 a special committee to look into its controversial partnerships. But analy=
sts also worry that Enron's trading partners could pull the plug if they lo=
se confidence that it can honor its trades.

"ON CRACK?" Inside Enron, once-cocky employees are reeling. They were still=
 puzzling over the abrupt Aug. 14 departure of CEO Skilling when the compan=
y announced on Oct. 24 that CFO Andrew S. Fastow, architect of the controve=
rsial private LJM investments--which got their name from the first initials=
 of his wife and children--was removed from his post and on leave. In a ten=
se meeting held at a Houston hotel after the latest financial disclosures, =
soft-spoken Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay faced 1,600 employees, with ano=
ther 5,000 hooked up via the Web. One irate worker asked if he was "on crac=
k." Lay, an economist by training, turned over day-to-day management in 199=
7. Until Skilling quit, citing personal reasons unrelated to Enron, Lay was=
 talking about retirement, sources say. Now he is facing his biggest fight =
ever. "Ken is looking at a 30-year career of accomplishment going down in f=
lames. This is just awful," says one friend.

On the surface, at least, Enron's off-balance-sheet maneuvering hardly seem=
s the stuff that would crater a company. Amazingly, sources close to Enron =
claim that one rationale for Fastow's deals was to save an estimated $30 mi=
llion a year in investment-banking fees. Fastow's involvement in the partne=
rships, which bought assets from Enron, including stakes in telecom and ene=
rgy, was supposed to make the deals simpler for the investment bankers and =
thus cheaper. They were also meant, according to sources close to the compa=
ny, to hedge Enron's investments in potentially risky assets while allowing=
 it to maintain some control over them. Enron says Fastow made money for hi=
mself on some of the deals, but insiders insist there were less controversi=
al ways to enrich him if that were the aim. Fastow did not return calls see=
king comment. Lay, who declined to comment for this story, has said that th=
e partnerships were properly vetted by Enron's attorneys and internal and e=
xternal auditors and were approved by its board. A source familiar with Enr=
on agrees: "We had the best lawyers in the world saying, `It looks fine."'

But whatever Enron's reasons for creating the LJM partnerships, the problem=
s were compounded by scanty disclosure. The deals were first revealed in a =
1999 proxy, raising concerns from investors and analysts. By this summer, w=
hen Enron's stock was falling and its bets in broadband were souring, compl=
aints about LJM grew louder. So in June, Fastow pulled out of the partnersh=
ips. When the write-offs came, Enron enraged analysts and investors further=
 by failing to disclose the hit to equity in its third-quarter earnings pre=
ss release. Instead, Lay mentioned it in a conference call with analysts. "=
We found it disconcerting that the company waited to disclose the additiona=
l $1.2 billion charge to equity in a fleeting comment in the middle of its =
conference call," says UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone.

BAD BETS. Still, Enron's credibility did not vanish overnight. Analysts hav=
e been lobbying for years for more information about how and where Enron ma=
kes its money in its often byzantine trading business. While the company's =
revenues were soaring from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion in 2000 a=
nd its stock was returning 500% during the same six-year period, Enron's ag=
gressive, even arrogant managers could ignore Wall Street's complaints with=
 impunity. But after its stock price collapsed this year (chart), the compa=
ny's attitude and operational missteps quickly caught up. And there was ple=
nty to worry about. The company's $3 billion power plant in India wasn't pa=
ying its bills amid a political controversy; its highly ballyhooed business=
 for trading high-speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom=
 industry meltdown; and its calamitous foray into the water business with A=
zurix Corp. has already cost Enron at least $574 million in write-offs.

These bad bets and the expensive LJM shock have investors worried about wha=
t else might be lurking at Enron. Many aren't sticking around to find out. =
"I think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the c=
redibility of the management team," says Richard A. Giesen, who manages the=
 Munder Power Plus fund, which dumped its Enron shares about a month ago.

It's not clear just how many off-balance-sheet financing vehicles Enron has=
 used over time. Some were created years ago to finance oil and gas produce=
rs. Analysts and sources close to the deals say there's no particular risk =
in these to Enron shareholders. Other interconnected entities, such as Whit=
ewing, Osprey, Atlantic Water Trust, and Marlin Water Trust, were a way to =
get assets no longer central to Enron's strategy off its balance sheet, fre=
eing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broa=
dband (table).

To entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into t=
hese deals, Enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren't enough =
to cover debt. Such "mandatory equity" deals have been used by at least a h=
alf-dozen others in the energy and telecom industries, including El Paso (E=
PG), Williams, and Dominion, says Standard & Poor's director Todd A. Shipma=
n. "Nobody's going to find anything that's particularly unique or below boa=
rd" in such deals, says one investment banker specializing in the energy bu=
siness.

Worst case, which Shipman considers unlikely, Enron could be on the hook fo=
r about $3 billion in its mandatory-equity deals. That could mean diluting =
its shares by more than 25% at today's prices. Analyst John E. Olson at San=
ders Morris Harris Inc. (SMHG ) figures a 9% dilution is more likely. Even =
if this $3 billion in debt were included on Enron's balance sheet now, the =
debt-to-capital ratio would climb to 54% from about 49% at the end of June.=
 Such a change would pressure Enron's credit rating but not push it below i=
nvestment grade, says Shipman.

HUGE HIT. Fastow's LJM, a private equity fund, was a different kind of anim=
al, according to sources familiar with the arrangements. It bought energy a=
nd other assets from Enron, which booked gains and losses on those deals. L=
JM was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the vol=
atility of some of Enron's investments, including stakes in high-tech and t=
elecom businesses and an interest in New Power Co., which markets power to =
consumers. When Enron terminated these deals in September, it took the $1.2=
 billion hit to equity.

But the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with=
 the company. The first place that might show up is in Enron's highly succe=
ssful online platform, which trades everything from gas and electricity to =
weather derivatives. To reassure its partners, Enron is scrambling to shore=
 up its liquidity. It has already tapped $3 billion in credit lines and is =
trying to arrange another $1 billion. Shipman says he has seen no signs of =
massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms. Still, ri=
val traders are wary. "We certainly have taken a closer look at Enron in th=
e last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk, but we'=
re still doing business with the company as usual," says Keith G. Stamm, CE=
O of power and gas trader Aquila Inc. (ILA )

"SPEEDING TRAIN." Still, with the stock battered and rating agencies consid=
ering further downgrades, that could rapidly change. In recent days, the un=
certainty about Enron's future has reduced investors' appetite for Enron de=
bt. "No one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of surv=
ival," says a credit-derivatives salesperson. "It's really difficult to get=
 in front of a speeding train."

Even if Lay can calm his trading partners, he and his management team face =
a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on Wall Street. With the=
 stock now hovering around $14--down from a high of $90 in August, 2000--so=
me even believe that Enron could be a takeover target for the likes of GE C=
apital or Royal Dutch/Shell Group. (RD ) Both declined to comment. Would En=
ron sell? One source close to the company says Enron has talked about possi=
ble mergers and strategic alliances in the past with Royal Dutch/Shell, amo=
ng others. "If they're really worried about liquidity, they might take the =
easy way out," he says.

If Enron does pull through this crisis, some suspect it will be a humbler, =
more risk-averse place. The company that once believed it could expand its =
trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities--from advertising=
 space to steel--will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions. That's=
 something some investors applaud. "The company should focus on its strengt=
hs," says William N. Adams, senior energy analyst at Banc of America Capita=
l Management, a major shareholder. But that's a far less exciting place tha=
n Enron's energy cowboys ever hoped to roam.=20

Business Week
Derivatives Danger?
Lately, owners of Enron's (ENE) equity, bonds, and loans have been struggli=
ng to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they di=
dn't know about before. Now, as a fuller picture of Enron's entanglements w=
ith partnerships begins to emerge, investors have something else to worry a=
bout: credit default swaps, known as CDSs for short.

That's financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans. Their o=
wners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they h=
ave if their investments go bad. The CDS market has existed only for about =
two years, but it's growing fast. Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS ) and others est=
imate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $1 trillion and $1.=
5 trillion are covered. Not surprisingly, big banks with hefty balance shee=
ts such as J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  ), Merrill Lynch (MER ), and Deutsche Ba=
nk (DB ) dominate the market.

Enron, however, is a player--and the only significant one that isn't also a=
 bank. Competitors say that although Enron has issued only between $500 mil=
lion and $700 million worth of CDSs so far this year, it had ambitious plan=
s to offer them online. "They don't belong in this market," says one trader=
. "They don't understand the implications." Enron did not return calls seek=
ing comment.

Of course, neither Enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans a=
nd bonds they're insuring turn bad. Trouble is, this year is potentially a =
doozie for losses on corporate debt. Corporate defaults could reach a recor=
d of $100 billion, says Standard & Poor's, like BusinessWeek a unit of The =
McGraw-Hill Companies. Regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $193 bi=
llion by early October.

If Enron has insured any of the bad debt, it might have to take charges for=
 losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting. With all that has =

Commentary: Enron's Clout Won't Sway the SEC=20
For Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, the SEC's inv=
estigation into Enron Corp. (ENE) could hardly have come at a worse time. T=
he future of Pitt's ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation co=
uld depend on how well he handles this case.

Enron's political clout and close ties to President George W. Bush create r=
eal risks for the SEC. Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay is a longtime Bush backer, =
and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the President's ca=
mpaign. A Bush appointee, Pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act. He h=
as made it clear he wants to speed up the SEC's enforcement, in part by rew=
arding companies that cooperate with probes. But he insists the SEC will st=
ill come down hard on true corporate miscreants--and knows that any signs o=
f let-up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda.

Enter the Enron probe. The fine shadings of securities enforcement--where m=
ost cases are settled by negotiated penalties, not court-imposed fines--oft=
en make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the SEC is being tough or len=
ient. But Pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the Enron case =
is handled by the book--getting the same strict scrutiny from the SEC as an=
y other, less connected company.

For now, top SEC aides say that's happening. The SEC Enforcement Div. in Wa=
shington is looking into whether Enron adequately disclosed to shareholders=
 the risks of its complex deals with Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former=
 chief financial officer. Agency insiders say Pitt and his fellow commissio=
ners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds. But they insist Pitt hasn'=
t heard from the White House or Enron's other political allies.

TOP LOBBYIST. Enron's connections are numerous. Besides Lay's links to Bush=
, an Enron director, Wendy Lee Gramm, is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gra=
mm, top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. And Enron spreads its l=
obbying budget--$2.13 million in 2000--across both parties. Just this year =
it hired four lobbying firms with Democratic roots. Enron says it lobbies h=
eavily because it operates in regulated industries. It notes that electric =
utilities outspend it 35 to 1.

On Oct. 31, a special committee of Enron's board hired William R. McLucas, =
former SEC enforcement director, to represent it. McLucas should know that =
any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire. Pitt, who joine=
d the SEC out of law school in 1968, "remembers how the [Nixon-era] SEC tai=
nted itself by turning a blind eye to [fugitive financier] Robert Vesco," s=
ays an agency veteran. Pitt has too much riding on the Enron probe to let i=
ts connections sway his judgment.=20

Williams CEO Sees Validation Of Co's Bandwidth Model

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- At the beginning of the year, two telecommunications =
units born of energy companies seemed to symbolize the different ways to se=
ll bandwidth.=20
Enron Corp. (ENE) was viewed as the hot pioneer blazing a trail for selling=
 telecommunications network capacity as a commodity like natural gas or ele=
ctricity.
On the other hand, Williams Communications Group (WCG) seemed to promote th=
e old-fashioned method that telecommunications companies have used for maki=
ng long-term agreements.=20
On Thursday, WCG reported third-quarter earnings of $22.6 million before ta=
xes and interest. WCG Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Janzen told Dow J=
ones Newswires that the earnings validated Williams' model of a bandwidth c=
ompany being a provider of services, not a trader of commodities.=20
"I think bandwidth trading has its place," Janzen said. "It's developing re=
latively slowly. The reality is (that) bandwidth is not a commodity except =
for lower-capacity services and on certain routes with large amounts of cap=
acity."=20
Enron reported an $80 million third-quarter loss for its Broadband Services=
 unit.=20
As Janzen views it, bandwidth is defined by the technology used to provide =
it.=20
"The bandwidth we'll sell five years from now will be different from what w=
e're selling today because of changes in technology," he said.=20
After taxes and interest, Williams reported a loss of $272.7 million on rev=
enue of $297.8 million in the third quarter. An extraordinary gain of $223.=
7 million from the repurchase of senior redeemable notes in the open market=
 enabled Williams to post the positive result before taxes and interest.=20
In the same period a year ago, Williams reported a net loss of $150.5 milli=

Williams also announced Thursday that it has agreed to buy the assets of Co=

Goldman Declines Enron's Request for Loan Amid Credit Concerns
2001-11-02 11:22 (New York)

Goldman Declines Enron's Request for Loan Amid Credit Concerns

     New York, Nov. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
refused to participate in a $1 billion loan to Enron Corp. because
it was unwilling to risk its capital on a client with falling
credit ratings that has been using its investment-banking services
less often, according to people familiar with matter.

     Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay asked for the line of
credit after meeting with bankers from Goldman, J.P. Morgan Chase
& Co. and Citigroup Inc. last month to discuss ways to alleviate a
cash crunch. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup agreed to lend on the
condition that the Houston-based energy trader pledge two
pipelines as collateral.

     Goldman's refusal highlights its reluctance to provide credit
lines to all but its top fee-paying clients. By not lending to
Enron, the firm also is able to advise companies that want to buy
Enron or some of its assets, or make a bid of its own.

     For Enron, the decision makes it harder to resist the demands
of its existing lenders, who made the company give up collateral
and pay higher interest rates to get its new loan.

     ``People smell resistance to Enron,'' said Glenn Reynolds, an
analyst with CreditSights.com, an independent research firm. ``The
balance of power is the with the banks now.''

     Kathleen Baum, a spokeswoman for Goldman, said the firm had
``a long history of putting its capital to work for clients.'' She
wouldn't comment on the firm's relationship with Enron. Karen
Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron, said, ``I won't confirm who we
have had talks with.''

                             Shut Out

     Enron needed the $1 billion secured loan to supplement cash
reserves and help the company pay off existing debt. Yesterday,
Standard & Poor's cut Enron's long-term credit rating to ``BBB,''
the second-lowest investment grade rating, from ``BBB+.''

     The SEC is investigating partnerships run by former Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow that bought and sold Enron shares
and assets. Those trades cost Enron $35 million. The company also
lost $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.

     Enron's dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of
commercial-paper markets, where corporations borrow money for days
or weeks. Lenders are concerned that the company may have further
losses from its trading business.

     A week ago Enron tapped $3 billion in credit lines, arranged
by J.P. Morgan and Citibank, to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial
paper it has outstanding.

     Already loaded down with Enron debt, J.P. Morgan and Citibank
forced Enron to pay as much as 2.5 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, on its new loan,
according to the people familiar with the matter. That's about
five times the spread Enron is paying on its existing lines,
according to Bloomberg data.

     The extra yield wasn't sufficient incentive for Goldman to
lend. Securities firms such as Goldman are required to value
lending commitments at market prices, exposing them to potential
losses from declines in loan prices. Banks such as J.P. Morgan and
Citibank are allowed to carry the assets at full value.

                          Falling Prices

     Enron's existing loans have already fallen to between 80 and
90 cents on the dollar since the company drew them down, according
to traders.

     The company's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as
much as 6 cents on the dollar today, with price indications
between 68 and 73 cents, traders said. Yesterday, traders bid for
the bonds at 74 cents and offered to sell them at 77 cents

     Goldman has been getting less investment-banking business
from Enron.

     The No. 3 U.S. securities firm by capital hasn't arranged a
bond sale for Enron since 1995, and Enron hasn't picked Goldman to
advise on an acquisition or sale since at least 1993, according to
Bloomberg data. The firm is a dealer on Enron's $3 billion
commercial paper program and has arranged six of the company's 15
preferred share sales.

     Without a steady flow of investment banking fees, Goldman is
reluctant to make loans that tie up capital in a business that is
less profitable than advising on mergers or underwriting
securities.

     Among clients the firm has turned down: Ford Motor Co., the
second-largest automaker, and Vodafone Group Plc, Europe's largest
cellular phone company.

     Goldman did extend $2 billion in credit to AT&T Corp. as part
of a $25 billion credit facility last year. The largest U.S. long-
distance phone company is one of the firm's most lucrative
clients, however, paying out more than $100 million in investment-
banking fees during the past five years.

     After refusing to lend to Enron, Goldman is unlikely to
advise the energy trader on any of its planned $2.1 billion in
asset sales, the people familiar said.

     J.P. Morgan is advising Enron on the sale of its Azurix North
American water business and may be retained, along with
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, to look at other disposals
and a possible sale of the whole company, the people said.

     Goldman, which has an energy trading business of its own, may
already be advising potential buyers of Enron's businesses, or
lining up a bid of its own, Reynolds said.

     ``We may well see Goldman pop up on the other side, which
would explain its reticence to lend,'' he said.


POWER POINTS: Time For A Bronx Miracle In Houston

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by=
 two runs with one man on, Enron Corp. (ENE) needs nothing less than a home=
 run just to stay in the game.
This is the home run Enron must come up with: Full disclosure of the assets=
 and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off the=
ir balance sheet, and proof the corporation can cover the difference. It's =
what stockholders, bondholders and trading partners have been demanding, bu=
t time is running out, and Enron hasn't produced.=20
"We're going to get to that number soon and tell people. We have to do that=
," said a source at Enron, who didn't know how quickly the disclosure would=
 come or whether it would be independently audited. "In this environment, w=
e are going to be absolutely sure that it's accurate."=20
Enron has about $3.3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in=
 2003. The company will sell the assets in those partnerships and, in a wor=
se case scenario, will face a $1 billion shortfall that could be covered by=
 selling stock and other company assets, Enron has said. The company hopes =
that when the time comes to issue new stock, shares will be trading closer =
to $20 than their current $11.=20
Investors, however, aren't acting as if they're reassured. Part of the trou=
ble, analysts with credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's said Friday morning=
, is that until Enron sells the assets, nobody knows for sure what they're =
worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole.=20
S&P is confident that Enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole, pro=
vided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with =
the company.=20
Credit Derivative Fizzle=20

To see the pickle the world's premier energy franchise is in, one needs to =
look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk. That relatively n=
ew and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely, but the desk=
 hasn't been able to transact for three weeks, since the value of Enron's s=
tock and bonds began to plummet, according to another Enron employee.=20
Enron didn't respond to a request for comment, but the Enron Credit divisio=
n in Europe said in a release that lines are "constrained" as the market co=
ntinues to evaluate the company's credit position.=20
Until recently, customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover=
 its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company. A big supplier to a financi=
ally troubled company like Xerox Corp. (XRX) or Lucent Technologies (LU), f=
or example, might pay Enron $1 million a year for a payout of, say, $10 mil=
lion in the event of a bankruptcy.=20
But you wouldn't pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure tha=
t the insurance company could pay your claims. Likewise, with Enron's credi=
tworthiness in doubt, there's no reason to pay a lot of money just to excha=
nge Lucent risk for Enron risk.=20
The same holds true, though less obviously, for Enron's core business of en=
ergy trading. Some utilities, large industrial companies and other energy t=
rading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - alr=
eady on the rise at $3 per million British thermal units - shoot to $10 thi=
s winter as they did last winter.=20
To guard against that risk, companies buy contracts now for delivery this w=
inter at set prices. If a company wants to lock in winter gas at $3, should=
 it turn to Enron? If gas were to rise to $10 in January and Enron couldn't=
 deliver, Enron's counterparty paid a good price for no protection. And if =
Enron failed in a $10 gas market, that would send hundreds of companies scr=
ambling for supplies. Gas could go to $20 in a heartbeat.=20
Leading Role An Asset=20

Enron does have a man on base. The company is so important to energy market=
 participants that they desperately want Enron to survive. And any company =
that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enr=
on survives as the big dog.=20
Enron's trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point: T=
hey are continuing to trade with Enron, but are avoiding long-term deals th=
at increase their exposure to the company. The only acceptable long-term de=
als are those that offset deals done earlier. Unless and until a bill goes =
unpaid, they'll keep delivering.=20
Enron, like the rest of the U.S. energy industry, paid its bills for Septem=
ber gas deliveries on Oct. 20 and for its September electricity deliveries =
on Oct. 25. Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of Nove=
mber.=20
That means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables=
 at risk before Enron's creditworthiness faces another test. In exchange fo=
r taking on that small risk, they keep the great market maker in business.=
=20
Lenders Show Concerns=20

Lenders, whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans, don't have=
 the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a sh=
ort leash. Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time, usu=
ally years.=20
Outside of long-term commitments, what worries the banks, which presumably =
got a good look at Enron's books? If Enron is now unable to make the big be=
ts with long-term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years, can =
it service all of its liabilities, known and unknown? If it has to sell pro=
fitable assets like pipelines and power plants, or otherwise put those asse=
ts at risk, will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs? What =
happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsew=
here?=20
If Enron is to have a chance, it needs energy trading profits to keep rolli=
ng in so that it can continue to service its debt. So far this year, tradin=
g and other wholesale operations have accounted for $2.2 billion out of $2.=
4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes. By comparison,=
 Enron has made $617 million in interest payments so far this year.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) unit Salomon Smith Bar=
ney, at least, don't show much confidence Enron can do it. When they agreed=
 to provide Enron with a $1 billion line of credit, they did so only after =
Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral.=20
Bond traders - the most sophisticated investors in the world - make their m=
oney by understanding the probabilities. They're trading Enron debt at leve=
ls typically associated with distressed companies.=20
The lenders have chalked up their runs. Shareholders have ratcheted up the =
pressure.=20
Enron, now, must step up to the plate.=20

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares fall as investor concerns linger.
By Janet McGurty

11/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Shares in Enron Corp., the U.S. energy trading =
giant facing a federal probe into its dealings, declined on Friday amid lin=
gering investor concern about management credibility and the outcome of pen=
ding lawsuits.=20
Shares of Enron were off 62 cents, or 5.2 percent, at $11.37 in early after=
noon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, recouping some losses after plun=
ging briefly to $10.95, a closing price last seen in July 1992 and touched =
in intraday trade on Tuesday.
Enron debt due in 2006 declined about another 6 points, and was trading at =
about 65 cents on the dollar. The bonds were trading at about $1.01 two wee=
ks ago, before Enron announced on Oct. 16 a $1 billion charge, caused in pa=
rt by dealings linked to partnerships run until recently by a chief financi=
al officer who was ousted last week, and that form part of the federal prob=
e.=20
"There remain several fundamental issues that we believe need to be address=
ed before the clouds can clear above Enron's skies," said Ronald Barone of =
brokerage UBS Warburg.=20
Apart from the probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Barone said=
 concerns include "the evolving state of the company's balance sheet, manag=
ement credibility and ultimate outcome of shareholder lawsuits."=20
A handful of law firms have sued Enron, saying it overstated operating resu=
lts, failed to write down assets on a timely basis and concealed investment=
s that might require the company to issue large amounts of shares to cover =
loses.=20
Enron's woes have put it under intense investor scrutiny, with the company =
losing about $17 billion in market capitalization in the past two weeks. Th=
e AFL-CIO union umbrella urged Enron on Friday to review executive compensa=
tion and adopt procedures for insider investments, among other recommendati=
ons.=20
AFL-CIO affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds that hold an estimated 3.1 m=
illion Enron shares.=20
PREMIUM PLAYER IN RISK MANAGEMENT=20
Shares also plunged on Friday - they have fallen about two-thirds in the pa=
st two weeks - after Standard & Poor's cut Enron's credit rating late Thurs=
day, the second cut this week.=20
Although S&P said another rate cut could ensue if Enron's situation worsens=
, a team of S&P analysts told investors on a conference call on Friday they=
 were confident they were aware of all the company's financial obligations.=
=20
Enron has been criticized for providing scant details about its dealings, l=
eading to concerns about the riskiness of its obligations.=20
"Enron is a premium player in the risk management area," said Ronald Barone=
, a member of the S&P team who is not related to UBS's Barone.=20
The S&P analysts said they were using about $1.5 billion as the amount of o=
ff-balance sheet items, about half the $3 billion calculated in past years,=
 because of a change in reporting international energy assets, which no lon=
ger puts non-recourse debt onto the balance sheet in places like India and =
South America.=20
The S&P analysts also said they felt Enron's move to secure a $1 billion li=
ne of additional credit earlier this week sent out Enron's clear commitment=
 to credit quality.=20
They also said it seemed reasonable to expect a long-term solution to fix E=
nron's hard to understand balance sheet would assume an infusion of long-te=
rm equity as well as asset sales.=20
The S&P ratings team also said it was closely monitoring Enron's trading pa=
rtners for a change in their credit stance toward Enron and, to date, have =
seen no significant change.=20
But they cautioned that could change at any time and that was the reason fo=
r putting Enron on the credit watch listing.=20
Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay, who has been criticized=
 for not providing the public enough details on Enron, was a no-show at a b=
usiness conference in Houston where he had been scheduled to speak on Frida=
y morning.=20
Enron executive Robert Bradley, who declined to respond to questions from R=
euters after his speech, said he had been sent to replace Lay because "Ken =
is better at putting out fires at Enron."

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

We have postponed issuing the DPR until the terminations that have already been entered into are appropriately reflected in the risk books.  My aim is to produce a full preliminary DPR next Monday for this Friday's trading activity.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

It's the week-end!  This is just a general overview , if anyone wants detail, please give me a ring.

In general we are doing OK.  In terms of cash out the door today, we were actually going to be positive until Kinder Morgan refused to send our cash back.  We should be ($5.81mm).

Cut us off:
1. 	FPL (balance of month transactions only)
2.	Enbridge (Consumers)
3.	Proliance
4.	Con Agra
5.	Los Angeles Department of Water
6.	Apache
7.	PSEG (physical gas sales only)
10. 	PowerEx (Cash and Real time only)
11. 	Salt River Project
12.	Pacificorp (NorthWest Cash only)


Issues:
1.	PJM Interconnection LLC - want $30mm LC, we are working with them on their calculation methodology.  Awaiting a letter before we react.
2.	AEP  - We completed $50mm of assignment transactions with them on Friday night.  We also sent them $50mm earlier in the week when they had no contractual rights to it.  They'll be back on Monday!!!!!!!!  They have not cut us. They blinked first!!!!!  
3.	Mirant - Still want the physical gas collateralized.  We have offered to sell it to them.  They are still scheduling.  
4.	NGX -  They have taken our lines to zero.  Peter Keohane is working on it.
5.	Sempra - Sempra are still trading but wanting to take their positions to zero.  
6.	Spinnaker - We MAY have agreed to monetize a position and therefore pay out $3mm plus.
7.	Kinder Morgan - Asked for collateral for the first time ($39mm).  Sent a letter suggesting material breach of contract, we have responded by letter to Park Shaper CFO.
8.	Conoco Contract - Equiva (we gave it to them), Apache, Conoco, Pogo, Sempra, ConAgra, Vitol have all attempted to get collateral under the adequate assurance clause.  
9.	GISB - We appear to have been confirming some transactions under the GISB rather than the Masters.  This is causing problems as it includes the 'adequate assurances' clause.  W&T Offshore Inc, Mirant, Devon, Sequent.  Letters have been sent.

LCs to Cash this week
1. 	Sempra - 50mm
2. 	Reliant - 78.5mm
3. 	Engage - 19mm
4. 	BP - $46.5mm

OTC Margin this week

Monday 10/29 = ($62,486,000)
Tuesday 10/30 = ($88,580,000)
Wednesday 10/31 = ($32,940,000)
Thursday 11/1 = ($13,390,000)

What level of expense do you want to be notified about?
 
(e.g. I want to authorise Kal to spend about $5,000 over the next couple of weeks on preliminary work for marketing materials to support a relaunch of EnronOnline)

Two costs will be re-signing the pipeline call-in numbers on sing throught the whole pipelinenetwork and all stationary/business cards for the estate.  I would think Netco would want a clean break and we could share 853 until a new extension can be secured.

Don, 

Process is well underway with the West Power Portfolio.  We have the portfolio sorted by:

- MTM position
- terminated vs active
- collection risk 
- type of contract

We have strategies for our top 5 exposures representing $600MM+ of estate assets and we are in discussions with several marketers that are looking at assignments.  There are 5 commercial and 3 legal people working on this.  

Going forward, JonAlan Page (Portland Estate) is interested and would be very good. Brad Richter is also interested and has one or two junior commercial people in mind to help as well (Brandon Wax).  I think Brad is a perfect fit - he knows some of the contracts, counterparties and he knows the marketers and attorneys in Portland.   He and I spoke today and agreed that it made sense for him to start working on this subject to your approval.   

My thought is that the commercial and legal team expands with the addition of Brad, Brandon and JonAlan and then it contracts when Netco starts pulling them in a different direction in January.  

Regards,

Chris Calger

Faith:

Please find the attached budget for TX Gas Orig per Louise's request.  I have compared the budget distributed by David Vandor to the budget submitted to the Office of the Chair last September (adjusted for a smaller head count).  This is located under the Natural Gas Orig - Texas tab in the attached spreadsheet.

My main comments are as follows:

1.  Travel and Entertainment seems a bit low as we need to be meeting with/signing up/marketing to a new customer base. 
2.  NetCo will need to pay for outside engineering and technical services as our in-house staff has been reduced (pipeline mapping, flow analysis)
3.  The Supplies number for NetCo seems low given past expenditures.

Please call or email me if you need anything else.

I am told by my doctors that I may not be able to talk for several days following the surgery.  When necessary, we may need to communicate by e-mail.  I will definitely be out of the office January 14 and 15.  I plan to take my recovery day-by-day and will return to the office as soon as I am able.

Hi Louise / Jay

If you can help shed any light on your vendor relationship with Legato
and Rational, and whether you believe there is scope for reviewing
these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements,
that would be extremely helpful.  We understand that both these
products would be critical components to running the Netco systems.

Thx
Ursula

Thanks Bert.  As promised, I am following up with E Company on the
various
assigned agreements that prohibit providing service to a third party.
Feel
free to have Ursula pursue the question simultaneously.  I am also
looking
into what services the parties intend Fire to provide for transition as
this is not a part of the transaction that I have been following

     The two licenses are:

     1.  Enterprise Software License Agreement between Legato
Systems, Inc. and [E] Corp, dated as of Sept. 27, 2001, respecting
numerous software products generally branded with the names
NetWorker, GEMS, Celestra, Octopus and others.  Section 2.2
provides:  "Restrictions on Use.  Licensee shall not, and shall
not aid, abet or permit any third party to: . . . (iii) . . . use
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use . . .
the Software . . . for the benefit of third parties . . . ."

     2.  Products License Agreement #3185 Modified for [E]
Corp, issued by Ration Software Corp., dated as of Feb. 17, 1998,
respecting various software products branded Clearcase, Rational,
Purify, and Quantify and others.  Section 1.1 provides:  "General
Grant of License. . . . You may not rent, lease or use the Product
in a service bureau capacity. . . . ."

     We continue to review the agreements for the Service
Bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective.
We have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring
those to your attention as a group later.

     If other express provisions such as the above turn up, I
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our
IT personnel are taking seriously.

With respect to the master netting agreements, Aquila does not want to enter into one.  We have forwarded Aquila a new Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement with revised collateral provisions which is the way they want to go.

I hope this meets your current needs.

Re:  CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION
        FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS



Many people have questions regarding how Enron will be operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.  This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. 

During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.

In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents.  Specifically, Enron will  be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis.  The court and our new debtor-in-possession ("DIP") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows.  The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections.  The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows.  Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.

The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company.  In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron.  However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.

The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887).  In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.

We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.  We will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements.

Attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required .  Please review this template in advance of the Wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format.  Obviously the requirements may change, which will require us to reformat and/or obtain additional information on short notification.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  We look forward to your attendance on Wednesday.

I am working on two Master Netting Agreements, El Paso and Duke.
Credit is reviewing a rough draft (w/o credit terms being filled in) of the El Paso Netting Agreement prior to sending it to the counterparty. (I will be coordinating this counterparty with Lisa Mellencamp.)
We are waiting for instructions on which entities and contracts will be included in the Duke Netting Agreement.

Thanks. Will talk with you tomorrow. One issue that should be discussed is
the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today. My guess is that
any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
will want to use as well as credit department needs. And so sending out
language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder. This is only a
timing issue I think but is important nonetheless.

Louise,

I would like to schedule time with you, when your schedule permits, to discuss my decision to not proceed with UBS.  I spoke at length with Hunter this morning to ensure the appropriate parties were aware of my decision.  I subsequently left a message with Rob Milnthorpe.

I appreciate your support over the last few months and wish you the best of luck.

Sincerely, 

Laura Luce

Louise,

Theresa Vos will ask you to authorize a wire request for $100,000 for the Roseville.  This payment is required to keep the agreement with the muni alive which protects $5MM - $15MM of value for the creditors.  A plan for monetization of this and other West positions is being pursued (we have $1.1MM coming in this month for ERC sales).  I recommend we fund this $100,000 payment.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation," said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
"Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes," said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. "A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year." 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a "lagging" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or "junk"-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues," he said. "That is a positive for credit quality." 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation," said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on a new credit line.
"We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron says in talks with banks for new credit line.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
"We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
"Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits," said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson. 
"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation."

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a "death spiral" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or "shareholders' equity," by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a "sell" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
"Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story," Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a "buy" or "strong buy" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
"We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company," Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. "This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point." 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for "personal reasons." When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO." 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
"I don't know anybody who said that," Wasden said. "What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
"Enron has been a cult, more than a company," he said. "Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside." 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
"There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants," he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above "junk".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to "Baa2" from "Baa1," and said it may cut Enron's "Prime-2" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered "difficulties in rolling over commercial paper," Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to "negative" from "stable."

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
"I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow," said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
"They are talking with us about bank letters of credit," he said. "The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis." 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
"We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader)," said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
"Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem," said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow "purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market," according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
"I think if is too early to tell," Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. "As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron." 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. "At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions." 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
"Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine," he said. "This is a big case, by any means."

Can I hire Martin Lin back into Netco from the estate.   He has provided va=
luable transmission & dispatch modeling expertise to our fundies group (he =
worked for Vince in Research).   We have lost Anna Santucci to CMS and this=
 would not change our headcount in the fundies group.

Additionally, if I was forced to cut additional bodies, most of the cuts wo=
uld likely come from real-time (3), options (2), regional trading (2), logi=
stics (1-2).

For Martin's planning purposes, I need to know something ASAP.   Thanks.

Louise, 
Enron Property has asked me to validate whether some of the remote office leases should be paid for January.  I have been unable to get an answer about the Denver office.  Will you please advise?

We will still be able to reject the lease even if we pay the January rent, if we do so by Feb. 2 under the bankruptcy rules.

Thank you, 
Tammy

Enron Bonds Subject To Market Jitters, Not Buyout Talk
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/05/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Reports over the weekend that embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company's bonds Monday. 
On Sunday, the Independent in London reported that Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (RD) planned to mount an $11 billion offering for the company. And Barron's stated that there was speculation that Enron might attract takeover interest from either Royal Dutch or Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA).
Enron's bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in relation to Treasury bond issues. 
A $74 bid and a $77 offer was quoted as the market for Enron's 7-7/8% bonds of 2003 Monday morning, similar to Friday's levels. 
"The company's bonds were quoted in the low- to mid-70s on Friday and the rumors have not shown up in that pricing," said Wayne Schmidt, portfolio manager, Advantus Capital Management, St. Paul, Minn. 
"Market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds," said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. 
Even an Enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par, traders said. 
The 6.45% coupon bond due on November 15, 2001, less than two weeks away, was bid at a dollar price of 99. 
"Some investors don't want to own anything with a downside risk," said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. The bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame, with little upside potential gain, he added. 
There is "very little liquidity in the company's bonds," said Rivkin. Enron's bonds will follow the company's stock movements, he added. Enron closed Monday at $11.03, down $0.27 from Friday's close of $11.30. 
Enron officials weren't immediately available to comment. 
Crisis Of Investor Confidence 

The Houston-based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor confidence since it reported a $618 million third quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last month. 
And last Wednesday, the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into Enron's financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The ratings agencies have reacted to the company's liquidity problems brought about by the loss in investor confidence. Fitch downgraded Enron's senior unsecured debt Monday to triple-B-minus, from triple-B-plus. It's now just a notch away from junk bond status. 
Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered the credit rating to triple-B, while Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating to Baa2. 
Shell May Have Interest, But 

Royal Dutch Shell may have an interest in Enron, say analysts. 
"Shell has a very sophisticated trading operations and has been looking to expand in North America and Latin America," said Tina Vital, equity analyst, Standard & Poor's. 
Enron is known for its trading prowess. 
And Enron could also be attractive if it could be bought cheaply, since "Shell has a history of not overpaying for its acquisitions," Vital said. 
But, "no one is going to buy the company unless it squares up its equity issues," she added. 
The company is not perceived by the markets as having been forthcoming in its financial reporting, analysts said.

Market Views Enron Takeover Rumors With Skepticism
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/05/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With each day shedding light on new revelations about Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial dealings, it is difficult to put odds on the company as a takeover target. 
But speculation has been persistent that Royal Dutch/Shell Group may use Enron's weakened position to launch either a friendly or hostile takeover.
Over the weekend, the British newspaper, The Independent, fanned the flames of speculation again by saying that Shell was expected to offer $11 billion for the Houston energy trader. 
A Shell spokesman wasn't immediately available. 
Surely, Enron's thousands of miles of pipeline assets would provide a company such as the Anglo-Dutch oil giant with a great advantage in the U.S. natural gas market, where Shell has maintained it wants to increase its presence. 
However, a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liabilities lurking in the company's financial structure. Enroll has used a web of off-balance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and preserve its credit rating thereby lowering its borrowing costs. 
Some have also alleged the company used the structure to shift losses off its balance sheet. 
Several arbitrageur traders said it is unlikely a conservative company such as Shell would want to make an acquisition while a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation is pending. 
As for Enron's core franchise - its energy marketing and trading business - it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is Enron's staff. As a result, it would help if deal were friendly because such a transaction could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with hostile transactions. 
Shell has been growing its own position in the wholesale energy marketing and trading sector through its Coral Energy unit, and the acquisition of Enron could give it instant clout in the market. Also, Shell's strong balance sheet would provide the market will necessary assurance of creditworthiness. 
Traders and those who follow corporate mergers and acquisitions agreed it would be better for any prospective buyer to wait it out until the situation calmed and more details of Enron's business are uncovered. 
A growth-fund manager, who requested anonymity, also said it is important to know where the rumors are coming from given the decline in Enron's stock price. He speculated that some hedge fund managers might be attempting to use the rumor to stir up interest in the battered stock. 
Enron shares recently traded at $11.14, down 16 cents, or 1.4%. The stock began the day in positive territory, and traded as high as $12.20 intraday. 
The stock has declined more than 60% since the company in mid-October posted a third-quarter charge of more than $1 billion. The company also later disclosed an additional $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its former chief financial officer Andy Fastow. 
In the weeks that followed the disclosure, Enron's credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch.

No Excuses for This Enron Board
By James J. Cramer <<mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com>>

RealMoney.com
11/05/2001 03:27 PM EST
URL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10003517.html>>

The more I look at this board of directors at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , the more puzzled I am. I thought that the directors would be somewhat typical of the "professional" board members that predominate at large companies, busy people who wouldn't know a derivative if it walked into them and hit them along side the head with a two-by-four. 
It's just the opposite. Let me rip down some of these folks' bios, and you can be as puzzled as I am. Let's take them alphabetically. 
Robert Belfer ran Belco Petroleum, and comes from a sophisticated family of oil operatives. He should be able to spot anything that even smacked of chicanery in the oil business from just his old-boy ties. I know this family; they are very smart and very wise to the ways of Wall Street, Main Street and the oil patch. 
Norman Blake is a gent I met years ago at USFG, before he sold it at a huge profit. This man has recently served as CEO of Comdisco, a leasing company that is not only comfortable with debt and financing, it is wallowing in it. 
Blake has General Electric training. This man can smell things that are not so right from miles away. Where was he in all of this? Stuck in Comdisco hell? 
Ronnie Chan is a longtime kingpin in Hong Kong, a place where financial originality is always on display. Chan certainly would have understood how unseemly all of these 17 partnerships would have appeared. He's seen everything over in Kong. 
John Duncan is an energy investment guy, a director of EOTT Energy, and a seasoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting. Again, very sophisticated. 
Wendy Gramm regulated derivatives. She was the chairman of the CFTC and a director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. How could she not have spotted this obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed? That was part of her old job. 
Robert Jaedicke was a professor of accounting at Stanford Business School, where he was also dean. This guy wrote the book on this stuff and really should have seen it coming. 
(I am skipping Ken Lay, the CEO.) 
Charles Lemaistre and John Mendelsohn, two execs from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, can't be expected to catch this stuff, and therefore gets a pass from me. 
Paulo Ferraz Pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the State Bank of Rio de Janeiro. That's probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations. How could he not raise a word about it? 
Frank Savage serves as chairman of Alliance Capital Management International, perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management. I am sure Savage never saw a situation as bad as Enron's looking through his own company's portfolio of investments. 
Jeffrey Skilling, the man who resigned as CEO, needs to be heard from. We know that he is a director of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don't get hold. What did he know and when did he know it? 
John Wakeham, Lord Wakeham to everybody, is perhaps the most financially sophisticated Brit to serve in Parliament. He managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant. He's big and powerful and smart. 
Herbert Winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of Penn Central, a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations. 
In short, this is the most sophisticated, hands-on group of folks I have come across. I can't believe they checked off on this stuff. I have to believe they didn't know, or if they knew of the partnerships, I believe they had no idea what they were doing. 
I want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt Enron's credit rating with the agencies -- not that that's such an ethical setup. But at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant, as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were. 
Still, let's not fool ourselves. This was a powerhouse, fantastic, upright board of people who know a thing or two. I can't believe they let this stuff occur. I think they knew nothing. 
Which is pretty terrible in its own right. 



This Market Deserves Your Well-Placed Optimism

D?j? vu circa 1991. That's what I keep thinking about. I recall that time vividly. Bank of Boston, Chase, Chemical, Citibank, they all started rallying. We bears would call each other and joke about it. We would say that it was a ridiculous move, that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively, because there was no way that any of these banks would make it. 
Heck, Bank of Boston was teetering on insolvency. Citibank was technically bankrupt already. The Jim Grants of the world (more powerful now than they were then because he didn't have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying. 
I would call the analysts, and they wouldn't know anything either -- the ones who liked the banks all the way down, who still liked them and who had no credibility at all. The ones who hated them didn't want to get off the winning horses. They didn't know that the race was over and that a new one had begun. 
Or, to put it the brutal way that I now know was right: No one with a brain was long any of these. 
Turns out, of course, that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom. What you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism, because at certain points in history optimists get it right. 
That's how I feel about this market. I think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred. I think we will look back at this period and say the following: The great bear market started in March 2000 and was continuing to run rampant until Sept. 11, the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around. Most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a Japanese recession or that no turn would ever come. They were wrong, just like they were in 1991. 
We get so caught up in the "Is Cisco bottoming?" or "Is Intel breaking out?" minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now, pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago. 
You would think that we'd have converted more bears to bulls by now, but like in 1991, it didn't happen until well into the turn. 
Don't confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities. I think that, for example, XO Communications is going to fail, and when it does, there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech. I think that McLeod is going to fail and we will see the same. There are a ton of companies that won't get through this period, just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in 1991. 
And I reserve the right to hate individual stocks. I can't get my arms around how Ford comes back; I don't understand the Enron fiasco at all. I am not even sure that Qwest can staunch the bleeding. 
But that doesn't make me bearish. 
Understand that I am strictly a Pavlovian creature. Had I not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991, had I not personally been "bought in" on a half-dozen banks I was shorting and had I not later on seen those banks get big bids from super-regionals not long after I, too, would be suspicious and want to bet against the market. I can't, though, because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that I don't want to get burned by again. 
Believe me, I am a cold-blooded individual about these things. If I thought the short side was the right side here, I would be all over it. We have had a huge bounce off the bottom; there would be nothing "unpatriotic" about saying "get out now." 
But I don't think that's right. I think this market's going to keep working here. 
If it doesn't, people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me, and I will say, c'est la vie, I took a stand; it was wrong. Taking stands, however, is what it is all about. Knowing your context and making money with that context is what I do and have done for 20 years. If you don't have a context, if you don't have a view, there's only one thing to do: Give your money to others who do. 
Random musings: Glenn Curtis's Era of Value Newsletter has been making me money. When something makes me money I talk about it. Check it out here. Curtis and Gary B. Smith both are doing some terrific things. Understand, I get all of the newsletters out there. I see the hype that a Navallier or a Murphy puts out and I want to puke. This stuff is nothing like that, nothing at all. It is honest, candid and doesn't guarantee that you will shoot the lights out, like those who you know can't ...

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=

I have a term sale to Colonial Oil for 1 cargo per month into Jacksonville Florida. I did not deliver the November cargo and they agreed to wait until Dec 10th. I can't perform on this commitment unless we can open an LC or pre pay in order to buy a cargo. Money would not be tied up more than a few days. Would like to perform and avoid any potential additional costs and/or damage to our credibility due to non-performance. Please advise.

Please call me ASAP regarding the December cargo.  We are baseline
sensitive.  We need a cargo into the system at the very latest December
10th, would prefer few days earlier.   

Also do you have current duty drawback that can be assigned?

The E&Y representatives (for the Creditors Committee) will be back in the office tomorrow (Wednesday) morning.  They want to continue to learn about how we conduct our business and may want to pay particular attention to how we value transactions in deciding termination amounts.  This has really gone beyond what the lawyers can effectively coordinate.  Bill Bradford suggested that Berney Aucoin might be a good resource for this process to assist Fallon and Miller since he really understands how we do deals from front to back and knows who all the right people are to speak to various issues.  If you agree, would you ask Berney to focus on this?  He can give me a call in the a.m.

>From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

Jennifer doesn't know it yet, but when I submitted final numbers to HR, I kept her suggested increases and did not apply her suggested decreases (which she did to balance the increases).
 
I expect we are going to lose some people. I hope the ones that go are not the best ones. Obviously, the more we are willing to spend in bonus, the fewer the people we will lose. 
 
When would you like to get together to discuss?

Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer

I have talked with them about phys rings. But the primary counterparty i was going to use was Dynegy. The trading wanted to make some money to do the deal, but i'm not sure where we stand with the other Dynegy stuff going on. So i'm on a holding pattern with Mirant unless you have any suggestions. geof

Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News
By Peter Edmonston

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
The Wall Street Journal Online 
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session. 
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened. 
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment. 
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. "The market is really shrugging off this news," said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift. 
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt. 
The uncertainty on the global front "looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair," Mr. Kroll said. "I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven." 
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. "The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings," said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added. 
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued. 
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates. 
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates. 
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32. 
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74. 
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts. 
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40. 
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be "difficult." 
Companies "are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter," said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as "double witching." 
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65. 
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower. 
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading. 
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown. 
In major U.S. market action: 
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%. 
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.

Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts

10/22/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships. 
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information. 
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors. More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com.

USA: UPDATE 3-SEC looks into Enron deals, stock slides 20 pct.
By David Howard Sinkman

10/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry.
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related party transactions" involved the partnerships. 
"Related party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. 
"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." 
Shares in the company are down 75 percent this year.

Enron shares plunge 20 percent after acknowledging SEC inquiry

10/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged more than 20 percent Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer. 
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week.
"We welcome this request," Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said in a statement Monday. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." 
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000. 
Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions. 
"Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," according to the section in the annual report. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an "informal inquiry." 
"This is not an investigation," he said. "We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us." 
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. "We can't confirm or deny that type of activity," Heine said. 
The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower after SEC questions transactions; AG Edwards downgrades

10/22/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down sharply in late morning trade, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions, prompting AG Edwards to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy', dealers said. 
At 11.10 am, Enron was down 4.29 usd, or 16.47 pct, at 21.76. The DJIA was up 57.57 points at 9,261.68, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 5.57 points at 1,079.05.
In a statement this morning, Enron confirmed that the SEC had requested documents, and said it would "cooperate fully" with the commission. 
However, the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC's request. 
According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim, Enron "significantly reduced" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially-owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron's chief financial officer. 
"This arrangement, which was not discussed in past SEC filings, has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community. 
"In our opinion, the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days. 
"However, we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed," Heim said. 
In its statement this morning, Enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related-party arrangements, adding that the Board was "fully informed of and approved these arrangements", which were disclosed in the company's SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," said chief executive Kenneth Lay.

HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading concern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about "certain related party transactions," including those between Enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. 
Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepared statement that it "welcomes" the request and looks forward to put "any concern about these transactions to rest."
In 4 p.m. EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fell $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65. 
Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in profits in transactions with the firm. The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document. 
Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited partnership created by Mr. Fastow. 
In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share. Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter. 
The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow. 
The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million and involve the early termination of "certain structured finance arrangements." 
The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported. 
The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said on Monday. 
Separately, an Enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in Texas court alleging Enron's board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
A law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Mr. Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest. 
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Mr. Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

      Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

                           Shares Plunge

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

      Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

      Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Thanks

Louise

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Equiva is looking for a $1,588,860 pre-payment on Wednesday, 11/21 to cover an MTBE cargo in NYH.  They will not consider any open credit and since we have already pre-paid them for crude in December our argument is falling on deaf ears.

Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  

Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight.

Pretty huge cuts,   I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from other areas).  This is probably all the detail I'll require.  Let me have your final numbers when you can.  Obviously if there are any senior position changes I think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who they like or not.

We do want to run the business as is, I think the big difference is new IT projects, we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale.  On Operations I think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is no longer required - we need to just get back to where we were.  

Thanks

Louise

Subject:	Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

>From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

Louise,

Jim Fallon told to wait for explicit intructions from him
before any transfer to NETCO takes place. He is my current boss.

I am afraid we are caught up in a legal mess here. All I need 
is a formal letter or an E-mail. Another alternative is to extend 
employment of some of my guys who are supposed to help with the transistion.

Subject:	Estate Fundamentals 


Lloyd and Tim H,   There is still some question about the amount and timing of fundamentals capability that will be required in the Enron Estate.  To date, our working assumption has been that all fundamentals systems (data harvesting, portals, metastock, decision support cubes, etc...) would only be operational in NetCo.  There is no IT staffing in estate to support fundamentals.

Beth Perlman told me today that Jim Fallon has indicated that we need to have IT people in estate who have the ability to bring up our fundamentals capability for the East and West Desks.

A few questions...  Do you agree?  If so, I can have our East Desk fundamentals team begin knowledge transfer to estate IT personnel.  I'll work with Beth on candidates.  Can this requirement be met for West Desk fundamentals?  If so, how would we proceed?  Who would be involved?

Thanks,  Steve

Hi Louise,

There are currently no IT people slated for NETCO who know anything about Infinity.  If we are going to use Infinity (even as a short-term solution) we may have to add some resources.  What are your thoughts about this?

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

I would like to add Nick Hiemstra (manager) to the SE orig team.  He's currently in the estate group.  He previously worked for Jim Meyn running power structuring for the SE.
 
I don't know the mechanics of moving someone from the estate to the Netco, but he would be a great addition.  I plan to include him on my org chart portion.  Please let me know otherwise.
 
Mitch

Subject:        NETCO 

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- 

(i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  

        The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     
(ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                                To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 
(iii)   Seating Plans                                                           Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. 

Happy New Year 

Louise

I'm not familiar with the individual assets (might include gaspart and ceg/rio) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $690mm loan to enron. When enron hit bbb- rating, rawhide was no longer allowed to lend to enron and called the note due. There was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider enron's request to delay the call by several weeks. Neither bowen nor myself know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time.

I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments.
 
Clearly at this point Enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer.  That would be a Don Miller/Fallon final call - but I think its a no brainer.

Under commitments to PEC, Enron has commited to provide office, computers, trading systems, etc.  If this is changing, I need to know quickly.  I have been provided indications from several outside counterparties, some divisions within Newco and I thought Netco as holding interest in purchasing the Chicago business.  Due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with PEC, I believe it imperative that the business/office be operational until March, 2002, at a minimum.
 
Please advise.

Laura, 
I understand that the Metals group has asked to keep the Chicago office open until Mar 31 to wind things down.  Do you have any new information on ENA's Chicago folks at this time?  We may ask for a 60 day extension under bankruptcy orders to terminate the lease.  

Thanks, 
Tammy

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary 
Portland 
San Francisco 
Chicago 
Denver 

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards, 
Tammy

The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.

Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kevin would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  

Let's discuss.  --Sally

Here's what I have received so far.
This is an incomplete list.
There are still several traders I have not talked to.

Vince is still compiling his list for Research.

Central and West Logistics, east orig & trading, west gas orig, structuring and canada have not submitted.

Central and west gas trading is incomplete.

I have weather, fundies, arnold's group, fred's group, laura's group, gosset's, and all the apps.

Lloyd Will is handling all of power including Portland.

I will be out all next week but available on cell (412-4632).

It is a touching message in the midst of all this bad stuff.  Matt is expressing what almost everyone who has been associated with EnronOnline feels, both those remaining and those who are no longer here: we were all a part of something special, and I think that compounds the loss we all feel.

This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.

A great reflection on you guys too.

* * * * * 
Tuesday, Dec. 4 
I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
* * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Under the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally

Tammie -- Happy New Year.  I am preparing a plan for designing/printing collateral materials (stationary, envelopes, etc.) for Newco since we will need to do a big mailing announcing the new trading web site. 

It occured to me that Newco employees will want new business cards as well.  Is the buyer going to handle printing business cards for us?  If not, I can help mock up some designs and talk to some printers about getting them printed quickly.  My thought was that we send out an e-mail to employees (around Jan 14th) with an order form where employees can put in their business card info. and submit to me.  Our group can collect all the orders and hire a printer to do one mass business card print run.  This will save money and create a consistent look for business cards.  When you can, pls. let me know what you think.

Thanks

Kal

As a follow up to our meeting last week with Colleen on the Ardmore facility, I had a conversation this morningwith Richard Sanders concerning the status of the settlement negotiations with Dynegy concerning Northern Natural Gas. I understand from Richard that part of the settlement will be an agreement that will allow Enron Corp to continue to lease the Ardmore facility as a data center. 

I just wanted to remind everyone that the lease also needs to allow Enron to provide space to NETCO for its hardware during a transition period until NETCO can relocate its hardware to a new data center. 	The lease also needs to make it clear that access to the Ardmore facility needs to be under Enron's control.

Similarily the software license that Enron will retain covering all the Enron developed software will also need to provide that Enron can use the covered software to provide services to third parties such as AEP, Bridgeline and Northern Natural Gas.	If anyone has any questions, please give me a call.

Hi Louise,
we've amended the plan with the new headcount information. I spoke with Jay Webb and he indicated that he'd talk with you regarding licensing fees, etc. Please let me know if you have any additional information. Thanks!

Attached is the first draft of the 6th floor plan.  If you are fundamentally in agreement with the locations of these groups, we'll ask department leads to put final names on seats.  

 


The 5th floor would accomodate IT, Accounting and Energy Op's (excluding logistics/scheduling).

Phase one will include moving estate people off the floors - best case Tues/Weds pm.
Phase two will include moving the people already on these floors to new locations - best case Weds/Thurs.
Phase three will include moving people from the Enron North building over - best case to be determined. 

Regards,
Tammy

We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

Thks
Jez

It has been made clear to me that Jeff Shankman needs to clear this transaction through Bill Bradford and Louise Kitchen prior to any capital going out the door.  It is my understanding that this has not been done.

George:

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

In case there is any confusion who is your HR contact following the last 2 days headcount reductions, attached is a updated listing. I anticipate we will make further reductions in HR headcount in line with the wind down of operations but will obviously notify you of these ahead of time.

Ray,

Eddie Meche (CRO) and Jim Bob Perkins (President) from Reliant will be meeting with you and I in your offices at 8:00AM.   The purpose of the meeting is to continue to educate Reliant on our current financial position.  They have been supportive in the market until last week where they came out with a public announcement with concerns about Enron.  Our hope is to give them further disclosure to get them comfortable with our near term and long term financial plans.  They have $100mm gross exposure ($50mm net exposure) to Enron and have recently slowed trading volumes.

Feel free to give me a call if you need further breifings.  I will be in the office about 7:00AM.

Thanks,
Bill

Greg,

1.  We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.

2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.  So we do not need to do anything.  I'll have the west soon. 

3.  We will have our physical gas position by point soon.  We will agree to prepay for all of Dec but we should only pay day by day.

Michelle,

As discussed we are planning 200 lay-off's in ENA effective Dec 15. Can you confirm that the $4500 payment is applicable to them, on account of WARN, accrued vacation, etc., If it does presumably we will pay within 7 days of Dec 15.

I am getting a lot of questions and at this stage and simply send we will "confirm it's applicability in next few days".

David

Louise,

I know you're swamped, so I am emailing this:

I'm happy to proceed as soon as appropriate, as we discussed, on the assumption that you will be successful in preserving my bonus for this year.

I'd like to rally the troops and get started on preparation for the next step, but before I can do much, we need to:

	- Make it official that I will be in charge.
	- Confirm or deny the following assumptions:
		- We will have a new name
		- We will want a slightly changed look for the new name, but still recognizeable as "the old 			EnronOnline"
		- The new name will in fact be a new entity (requiring assignment of old PA's or new PA's as 		appropriate).

I will keep a low profile until I hear from you.

Dave

Team:
	
We have set up two conference calls for this afternoon, the first at 5 pm (NY time) and the second at 5:30 pm. We are
currently confirming participation from Enron - either Louise Kitchen or John Lavoratto from the Wholesale trading
business.  You are each invited to join, either at 5 or 5:30 (the same call in number will work for both) depending on
your needs.

At 5, Ernie Pittarelli (Operations) plans to review with Louise or John the scope of the business going forward. This
may be of in interest to Pat O'Donnell (IT) and Per Dyrvik (Finance) as well.

At 5:30, the topic will turn to physical delivery. I would anticipate that Lou Eber (legal) will want to participate, as
well as outside counsel from Covington & Burling and Sullivan & Cromwell. Bill Glass (credit) and Mike Stockman (risk)
may also want to participate on this call.

The dial-in number, for both 5 and 5:30, is (888) 446-5348 (domestic) and (913) 338-9600 (international).

USA: Enron seen facing long road to restore confidence.
By Andrew Kelly

10/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. moved in the right direction by releasing more detailed financial data and tackling problems at peripheral businesses, but the energy giant still has a way to go to make Wall Street happy, analysts said Wednesday. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday. The company took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments, measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with.
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was "not thrilled" by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. And for good reason. 
Moody's Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. 
"There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved," Barone said. 
The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company's operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron's stock lost about two-thirds of its value, but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet. 
Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron's quality of earnings and cash flow. 
Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns, but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk, which could adversely affect some of the company's financing arrangements. 
"Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain, particularly overseas," he said. 
One such asset is Enron's 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant project in India, which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer, a local utility company. 
Enron's stock closed down $1.64, or 4.85 percent, at $32.20 on Wednesday. 
For the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period. 
Enron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the company's broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project.

USA: UPDATE 1-RTO seen key to boosting New England power supply.
By Scott DiSavino

10/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U.S. Northeast hinges, in part, on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). 
RTOs are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region's high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the interstate wholesale power market, believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers, in turn improving service and driving down rates. 
"If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time, it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation," Enron Corp.'s managing director of global government affairs, Rick Shapiro, told Reuters. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's top energy marketer. 
"How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market. It's crucial to the development of the market in New England," Mirant Corp. spokesman Ray Long told Reuters. 
Energy provider Mirant, of Atlanta, has 1,400 megawatts (MW) of generation in New England. The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts. 
"Once we get the permits for Canal, we will reassess whether to proceed with the project. A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process," Long said. 
THE NORTHEAST RTO 
FERC wants to see four super-regional RTOs created in the U.S. - in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. 
Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs, including a not-for-profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West. 
FERC Chairman Patrick Wood, seeking to spur the development of RTOs, favors giving utilities until Dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market, though the commission has not voted on this plan. 
The Northeast RTO will include New England, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region and possibly parts of eastern Canada. 
FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets. 
PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., is the nation's only fully functioning RTO. 
"The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM, New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market," Long said. 
Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than $440 million annually by eliminating the "artificial borders that now exist between New York, New England and PJM." 
An administrative law judge, acting as a mediator for FERC, considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO. 
The three plans were proposed by interested parties, including Mirant and Enron, and the region's grid operators - the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) in New York, ISO New England in New England and PJM. 
Last month, the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place. The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England. 
"If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003, consumers could save $1.5 billion ... $440 million a year ... over the New York/New England plan, which would not be implemented until 2006," Long said. 
Under the PJM plan, PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region, while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets. 
"Although nothing is perfect, PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region. New York and New England, which are younger markets, are still works in progress with some bugs to work out," Enron's Shapiro said.

Enron Seeks Replacement For AGA's Gas Storage Report

10/17/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the nation's largest natural gas trading company, isn't ready to let the regular report on U.S. natural gas storage inventory die, a company executive said Tuesday. 
Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year, Enron would like to see another organization take over the report, said John Lavorato, president and chief executive of the company's Americas Wholesale Services unit.
Speaking at a meeting with analysts, Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals. 
Without a regular report on storage gas inventory, the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past, he said. 
The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage, but the information isn't as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday. 
The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct. 9. It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July. The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities. 
It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September. Those estimates are generated by a computer model. 
Wednesday's weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct. 12. The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities. That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report. 
Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consulting firm, take over reports on storage inventory. 
INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They manage many of the gas storage facilities. 
Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited, he said. 
He said he thinks the AGA has found itself "in the middle of something it didn't want to be in." Originally intended for use within the gas industry, the weekly AGA report has become high-profile, and is even watched by equity markets, he said. 
Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report, wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA. Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures. 
When the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports, gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly.

Bush to Nominate Kelliher to Open FERC Seat, White House Says

Bush to Nominate Kelliher to Open FERC Seat, White House Says

     Washington, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush
will nominate Joseph Kelliher, a policy adviser to U.S. Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham, to fill the open seat on the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, the White House said.
    
If the Senate approves Kelliher, a former Republican counsel
for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the commission will
have its full five members for the first time since Pat Wood,
Bush's first FERC appointee, became chairman Sept. 1.
     
``I hope they speed him through the process,'' said
Commissioner Nora Brownell, a Republican who was appointed by Bush
earlier this year. ``He is a thoughtful person who knows how to
work through issues.''
    
Kelliher's nomination comes as the commission has pledged to
closely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity and
natural gas markets and promote competition. In the next month or
so, it is due to choose which groups will run the electric power
grid around the country, an important step in deregulating the
nation's power markets.
     
A former power industry lobbyist, Kelliher would fill the
opening left by the departure of Curt Hebert, a Republican
appointed by President Bill Clinton and named chairman by Bush.
Hebert left the commission Aug. 31 to join Entergy Corp. after the
White House made it clear Bush planned to make Wood the chairman.
With Kelliher, FERC will have three Republicans and two Democrats.
     
``Kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team now
working actively to finish the transition to truly competitive and
dynamic power markets,'' said the Electric Power Supply
Association, which represents competitive power sellers such as
Enron Corp.
     
The commission is responsible for ensuring fair wholesale
electricity and natural gas prices.



Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales
2001-10-17 14:59 (New York)

Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales

     Washington, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Federal regulators are
considering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in
California and 10 Western states, which power producers hope will
allow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight.
     
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plans a public
conference Oct. 29 to discuss altering the pricing formula. The
commission established caps in April and June, after skyrocketing
electricity costs led to insolvency for California's largest
utilities, units of PG&E Corp. and Edison International.

     ``We have heard and understand that people do think the
solution was very California-centric, and it was,'' FERC Chairman
Pat Wood said, indicating changes in the formula are likely. ``But
California's needs were very urgent at the time.''

     While commissioners declined to say what they would be
willing to change about the pricing formula, they want to fine-
tune the caps before the winter, which is the peak period of
demand and may yet cause another jump in prices, Wood said.
Changes could be made next month.

     The current pricing formula is based on the most-expensive
power generated in California. Enron Corp., Sierra Pacific
Resources and other sellers of power to California want the
formula to consider costs from all generators in the region.

     Enron blamed the formula for a July 2 blackout in Nevada,
when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low
based on the highest cost of supply then being offered in
California.

                         Lower Power Costs

     Though the cost of wholesale power in California has dropped
since the commission ordered the first emergency cap on April 25,
Wood said the Western states may face another shortage of power
and high prices this winter.

     The Pacific Northwest depends on hydropower for much of its
energy needs, and rainfall has been below normal this year. Part
of the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the
result of a drought that reduced power available from dams.

     ``I remain concerned about that part of the country,'' Wood
said. ``It has not been raining a whole lot out there.''

     The average price for a megawatt-hour at the California-
Oregon border in September was $24.91, down from $313.70 in April.
A megawatt-hour is enough electricity to power about 750 average
California homes for an hour.

     On the agenda for this month's conference is a proposal to
link the formula to the price of natural gas, a fuel used in many
generating plants.

     ``I'm not predisposed for or against specific changes,'' said
FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell. The Oct. 29 conference will help
the commission determine aspects of the price control that the
parties involved agree are working and those that are not, she
said.

                             Surcharge

     In a related matter, the commission also may halt the 10
percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in California to
cover the costs of collecting bad debt. The insolvent California
utilities now have plans to pay off their debts.

     For power sellers in the West, the current price caps often
require utilities to sell their excess power at a loss, Enron,
Sierra Pacific and other marketers said in statements to the
commission. They said the price they sometimes pay for power is
higher than the cost of supply from the most-expensive producer in
California.

     ``The determination of the proxy price should not be limited
to California generators,'' Enron said in a government filing. It
should be ``determined by the least-efficient generator in the
entire West.''

     Power marketers also should be allowed to recover
``justifiable costs above the proxy prices,'' Enron wrote.

     California officials had demanded the price controls after
PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison's Southern California
Edison racked up more than $14 billion in power-buying losses.

     The caps were extended to other Western states -- Oregon,
Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado,
Montana, Idaho and Utah -- in June because some said generators in
the West could simply get around the cap by selling outside
California when prices were higher elsewhere. The caps don't
expire until Sept. 30, 2002, though they can be changed.

     California said before the price cap was extended to other
states that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboring
states at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoid
blackouts.

     On July 2, Sierra Pacific cut supplies to 10,000 customers
for 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plants
were idled. It couldn't buy 50 megawatts of power in the spot
market, partly because of suppliers' concerns with the federal
cap, company spokesman Paul Heagan said at the time.


Enron Faces Questions Over Limited Partnerships, WSJ Reports
2001-10-17 10:11 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is facing
questions over agreements with two limited partnerships run by its
chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal
reported.

     Fastow set up LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP with
the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships have engaged in
billions of dollars of complex hedging transactions with Enron
involving company assets and Enron stock, the paper said. It isn't
clear from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings what
Enron received in return.

     Enron said about $35 million of its $1.01 billion charge
reported yesterday was connected with the partnerships and
involves the ``early termination ... of certain structured finance
arrangements,'' the paper said. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth
Lay said in an earlier interview that related transactions
involving top managers aren't unusual, the paper said.

     According to the arrangement, the general partner, made up of
Fastow and at least one other Enron employee, received a
management fee of as much as 2 percent annually of the total
amount invested, the paper said, citing the LJM2 offering
document. Fastow declined to comment, the paper said.

Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.  Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and John on resignations.  SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.  

Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and me.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.  

Thanks.  --Sally

I didn't realize that was an option!

In all seriousness, we need to put some type of structure in place to deal with OldCo.  I understand Kyle's concerns, and would like to do something.  Unfortunately, we won't have details about the retention package for a few more days.  In the meantime, all I can do is hope Kyle will give us the benefit of the doubt and do his part while we pull the details together.

Per the broker statement received this morning the initial margin for Mann increased by only $6.1MM.  It does not appear that they have changed their margin calculation method from this.  I have contacted the Enron person responsible for confirming the amounts to be settled with Mann and instructed her to contact me if Mann requests any settlement that differs from the statement received this morning.  The preliminary number for Mann's initial margin and variation margin was a net inflow of $4.8MM.

I will let you know of any changes.  Thanks.

	Theresa,

	Do we know the amount of COPEL cash that we will be receiving tomorrow that we can expect to be forwarded to the EPI bank account.  

	I believe the amount should be $19,046,751.97. 

	Please verify as soon as possible so we can pass the information on to Treasury.  Please let us know what time we can expect the money also.


	Thank you,

Happy New Year Louise.   Hope things are going okay down in Houston with the bidding process for NetCo. etc., and that you were able to take some holiday.   I want to thank you again for facilitating my transfer back to Canada.  I was really enjoying working in the Toronto office; the people are impressive and the opportunity in the Ontario market is definitely massive and exciting.  

For now, I'm going to be working on the 'estate' side of things for Enron Canada, but meanwhile, I've also started investigating some interesting opportunities outside (i.e. retail opportunities, online platforms, etc.). 

Anyway, per below, are you okay with ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK getting transferred over to Centrica ?

Please let me know when you get a chance.  All the London IT guys that were dealing with this appear to be gone, so I'll follow up as appropriate. 

Thanks, 
Paul

Centrica are not connected to TXU (aka Eastern Group) to my knowledge. At least as of October when I left London, they were competitors in the marketplace.

Is Centrica somehow related to TXU UK Limited?  I seem to remember that they were granted a license to use the name EnronDirect for 6 months in connection with a sale of Enron Direct (UK).

That's fine. If you like I am happy to respond to him, but I'll run it by Louise Kitchen first to make sure she is happy with the domain name being transferring over to Centrica.

Mark (and Mark) - Happy New Year, I hope you are doing well.   Could one of you get back to Josh Bourne at Register.com about this?  Register.com has been helping us manage our corporate suite of domain names.  My assumption is that provided the acquisition of Enron Direct (UK) by Centrica plc has been finalized, we should allow the domain name transfer to occur (though only for ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK as opposed to ENRONDIRECT.CA, ENRONDIRECT.COM, or other Enron Direct URLs). Will leave it to you to decide next steps...

Thanks,
Paul

Gus is in the environmental group.  Most of his time is spent on ENA  activities.  I think he is probably needed if you guys plan to have any asset activity or for orderly wind down.  Someone needs to pick him up.


Also, of the reg. people you picked up I don't think you picked up gas people who have supported you in the past.  Call me or have someone call me to identify your needs there.

Thanks.

Guys , I have just been told that pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Entergy - Koch we are obliged to provide them with a letter of credit ( to replace an existing one which expires ) for ?20m today ( by midnight ) or we will be in default - giving them the right to close out . I understand that it is not possible to provide an LC so we will need to cash collateralise them . We will either need to give them $ today or ? tommorrow ( when we will technically be in default , but they seem to be fairly relaxed ) . Can you let me know how you would prefer to manage this ASAP . Louise / Ray , John or I will give you a call when you get in .

Mark

My phone message this morning relates to the Master Netting Agreement that
we have been negotiating with your team for the past several days.  It is
my understanding that the language on both the ISDA and the Master Netting
Agreement have been agreed to but Enron is unwilling to sign either under
the current circumstances.  While we would like to get the ISDA signed and
have offered a margin holiday as an incentive, I also see your side of the
issue.  I would however ask you and your team to separate the two issues
and at least sign the Master Netting Agreement.

Based on Enron's stated goal to protect its core energy trading business,
Dominion is still transacting with Enron.  The Master Netting Agreement
should be in both of our interest by providing needed liquidity for
additional transactions.  I believe that everyone in this industry would
like to see Enron's energy trading emerge intact and Dominion would like to
provide whatever reasonable support we can towards that goal. The Master
Netting Agreement is a critical issue for us and represents the centerpiece
of out ongoing relationship with Enron.

Mark, I realize that your plate is extremely full right now and this issue
is not at the top of your list. I would simply ask that you ask the Enron
team that has worked on this the past days to remain engaged with our team
and bring this to finality.

The Road To Competitive Electricity Markets In Mexico

=20

Mexico's much anticipated energy reform seems to have been placed on hold u=
ntil mid-2002. The delay is due to two crucial factors: The economic slowdo=
wn that has led to reduced electricity demand growth, making reform seem le=
ss urgent, and the controversial tax reform, which is currently the primary=
 focus of the Mexican Congress. Under the current recession, industrial gro=
wth has slowed considerably, resulting in very little growth in electricity=
 demand this year. GDP growth, which is tied to electricity growth, for 200=
1, is projected at less than 1%, which is a far cry from growth in 2000 of =
just below 7%. In April 2001, the high electricity demand growth brought re=
serves down to nearly 0% and led to fears that severe energy shortages were=
 imminent. However, the new plants that came on-line this year as part of t=
he government's independent power producer (IPP) program, combined with muc=
h lower demand growth in the later part of the year, reduced the sense of u=
rgency.  =20

Energy reform is likely to be very controversial and may require a constitu=
tional change to allow greater participation in the sector for private inve=
stors. The rival political parties to President Vicente Fox's (National Act=
ion Party) PAN are expected to balk at any changes to the constitution, but=
 may accept changes to Mexico's enabling laws to offer openings to private =
capital. The Mexican Constitution currently requires the state to provide e=
nergy services as part of its public service obligations. Enabling laws can=
 be changed, however, to exclude industry and commerce from the definition =
of public service, which would allow a free market to operate in the electr=
icity sector. Yet, investors got a preview of the opposition to reform in J=
une when Congress blocked a proposal by President Fox to increase the amoun=
t of electricity that companies may sell to Comision Federal de Electricida=
d (CFE). Currently power companies that generate for their own use are perm=
itted to sell up to 20 megawatts (MW) of excess power to CFE. President Fox=
 hoped to allow these companies to sell up to 50% of their capacity to CFE.=
 Mexico's Congress ruled that this proposal was unconstitutional, as it rep=
resented a change in law, which cannot be done without first going through =
Congress. Reform of the electricity sector in Mexico has become more of a p=
olitical issue than an economic one.  =20

President Fox faces an uphill battle in devising an energy reform plan that=
 satisfies Congress. Many Mexicans believe that selling off state-owned com=
panies leads to higher prices, worker layoffs, and high profits for the new=
 owners, not improved service as government officials typically promise. Ba=
ck in February 1999, President Ernesto Zedillo submitted a restructuring pr=
oposal to Congress that envisioned the disaggregation, subdivision, and sub=
sequent sale of distribution concessions and generation companies. However,=
 the proposal died in Congress that year. Therefore, any proposal put forwa=
rd by President Fox will most likely not include plans to privatize the exi=
sting generation assets, although there is the potential that the distribut=
ion assets could be subdivided and the concessions sold to private investor=
s.  =20

The resistance to selling a substantial portion of CFE's generation assets =
creates a great challenge in Mexico's effort to establish a competitive ele=
ctricity market that will draw private investment into new generation plant=
s. The challenge is unprecedented in that the government would like to crea=
te a competitive generation market while retaining ownership of about 90% o=
f generation capacity. There are no global examples of how to accomplish th=
is feat and to make investors comfortable that the market will truly be com=
petitive. The problem Mexico faces is that investors will have to be assure=
d that the government will be prevented from keeping power prices artificia=
lly low to stimulate the economy during periods of economic slowdown. The t=
wo issues that will have to be addressed are how CFE will determine the pri=
cing for its plants and the form of subsidies to CFE from the Mexican gover=
nment.  =20


Market Pricing and Subsidies=20

=20

=20

CFE faces the inverse of the market power issue that has plagued so many ot=
her competitive generation systems. When an entity has market power in a gi=
ven region, that entity can withhold its generation, thereby forcing artifi=
cially inflated prices. At this point the entity, having market power, ente=
rs the market and makes windfall profits. Standard & Poor's has seen this s=
cenario played out in various markets all around the globe, with the recent=
 California crisis getting a great deal of attention. Mexico would face the=
 opposite problem because the government, through CFE, would own more than =
90% of the power generation and could exercise market power to artificially=
 keep prices low by bidding CFE-owned generators below their marginal cost.=
 This might be done to provide an economic stimulus to the economy, and CFE=
 could be reimbursed through some form of a subsidy from the government. Be=
cause CFE owns such a substantial portion of the country's generation, one =
of its plants would likely be the marginal plant for a significant period o=
f time, thereby eroding the profit margins of private generation companies.=
 In order to mitigate this risk for private generators, the government must=
 devise a law that would make it illegal to bid government-owned plants at =
below their marginal cost and eliminate any loopholes for providing CFE-own=
ed generation plants with government subsidies. Any future government subsi=
dies would have to be made by the Mexican government to CFE's distribution =
or transmission subsidiary, not to any generation subsidiary.  =20

Another issue that needs to be addressed is what the government will do abo=
ut the existing subsidies. In 2000, the government spent about $5.8 billion=
 subsidizing electricity bills, and the estimate for 2001 is slightly highe=
r due to inflation and population growth. In order to highlight these subsi=
dies to the population, the format of electricity bills was changed in July=
 to break out the cost of power and the amount that the government is contr=
ibuting as a subsidy. As there are no plans to do away with these subsidies=
, the government must structure them in a way that does not benefit CFE-own=
ed generation plants to the detriment of privately owned plants. One potent=
ial indirect subsidy to CFE that has been addressed is the price that CFE p=
ays for its fuel. Under Mexican law, all public entities are forbidden to s=
ell their products or services below market prices. Therefore, Petroleos Me=
xicanos (PEMEX) cannot legally provide CFE-owned generators with fuel at su=
bsidized prices, unless it offers those prices to all generators. This miti=
gates the risk of CFE lowering its marginal cost through an indirect fuel s=
ubsidy from PEMEX.  =20

=20

 <http://rd-digex.ratings.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/#TOP>




Need For Capital Investment=20

=20

=20

The push toward competitive electricity markets in Mexico is driven by the =
need for investment in power generation and the reluctance of the Mexican g=
overnment to continue to add off-balance sheet debt in the form of the IPP =
contracts. Mexico is forecast to require investments in the power sector of=
 about $5 billion per year during the next 10 years to keep up with demand,=
 most of which is expected to come from private investors. Although the cur=
rent economic conditions may adjust this forecast downward, substantial inv=
estment will still be required in the sector. Even though the IPP program h=
as been successful thus far, Standard & Poor's views these contracts as off=
-balance sheet debt of CFE, which puts negative pressure on CFE's credit ra=
ting. Because the obligations under many of these contracts cross default w=
ith CFE's debt, which in turn cross defaults with some of the sovereign deb=
t, these contracts also apply negative pressure to the sovereign rating. Wh=
ile this pressure is not substantial today, if the IPP program continues to=
 be the sole source of new generation in Mexico, these obligations will hav=
e a greater affect on the sovereign rating over time. Therefore, a move to =
a fully competitive electricity market, where private investors take all of=
 the financing risks, will alleviate credit pressure on the sovereign from =
the electric sector.  =20

In the interim, the Comision Reguladora de Energia (CRE) is working on crea=
ting a framework for the potential liberalization of the industry. CRE envi=
sions the creation of an independent system operator to manage generation c=
ommitment, dispatch, and billing. State-owned generators would be divided i=
nto regional entities to promote competition. The distribution sector would=
 also be divided into several regional entities, and a concession for the o=
peration and maintenance of these systems could be granted. The transmissio=
n network would remain as a single public entity, although concessions for =
new transmission projects could be granted.  =20

=20

 <http://rd-digex.ratings.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/#TOP>




Liberalization of the Electricity Sector=20

=20

=20

During the past nine years, Mexico has gradually liberalized the restrictio=
ns on the power market. CFE enjoyed a monopoly in the electric power sector=
 for many years, although reforms instituted in 1992 allowed IPPs to sell p=
ower to CFE and industrial customers under self-supply regulations. In 1996=
, CFE devised a financing plan to meet projected electric demand growth. Th=
e objectives of the plan were to lower the company's debt leverage, finance=
 projects at a lower cost, and extend the maturities of these obligations. =
As a result, for the first time, several new projects were structured as bu=
ild-lease transfers (BLT), which are similar to lease transactions. Under t=
his structure, a third party finances and builds a plant (or transmission l=
ine, or transformer) and leases the plant to CFE for a period during which =
the investment is amortized. At the end of this timeframe, ownership of the=
 asset is transferred to CFE. These BLT arrangements indirectly assigned mu=
ch of the operating risk to CFE, as CFE was required to pay for service eve=
n if the asset was unavailable. New facilities are now being constructed un=
der IPP contracts. These arrangements are structured as take-and-pay power =
purchase agreements whereby CFE will not pay for power if it is not deliver=
ed. The next step would appear to be the creation of an open market system =
where participants are free to buy and sell electricity. Yet, the outlook f=
or the creation of such a system is unclear in Mexico, given the highly pol=
iticized tripartisan environment that governs the decision-making process. =

Attached hereto is the current draft of Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which Enron will provide certain services to Netco and Netco will rpovide certain services to Enron.  I hope that this is what you are looking for. 

If you are looking for the division of assets between Enton and Netco, that will be detailed in the schedules to the agreement whereby the vaious assets are transferred to from Enron to Netco. These schedules list the software and hardware and other assets that will be transferred to Netco and the software. hardware and other assets are remaining with Enron, as well as those assets (primarily third party software) that Netco will need to obtain on its own.  The transition services agreement is intended in large part to bridge the gap between (i) the time of the sale and transfer of assets to Netco and (ii) time when Netco acquires these software programs and other assets.  

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks, Anne

Hi Louise,

We have almost exactly the same number of NA gas trades as yesterday at this time.  Power is off about 20%.  Overall trade count is WAY up though (more than 500 trades, about 33%).  The difference is all from the Metals group.

          Attached is version 5 of the cover memo, as redlined from prior version.  Your comments and suggestions are appreciated.  John, I rearranged your second paragraph, because I didn't want our ability to disclose the agreement to potential counterparties to be limited by our satisfying the conditions outlined below.  I hope that works.

If you need to reach me, I am at home at 713-218-7155, or on my cell at 713-302-5522.
 
Thanks for your thoughts and comments.

Guys, it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel (Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, Edith Cross, etc) into NETCO before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization.  It is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all EES retail risk contracts are valued and discharged (termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate.  After completion of this effort, these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate.  I would expect this to take the next four weeks.

Thanks
Dave Delainey

In the immediate term, I am requesting we provide an LC to PEC in the amount of $2.5 MM to cover PEC providing 100% of guarantee to WPS.  The executive management of PEC is in NY for their annual analyst meetings.  I will address the other outstanding transactions and potential remedies the week of November 26th in Chicago.

Subject:	LC to Peoples


Here is the current situation with third party credit support.


Wisconsin Public Service (WPS)
- 5 day Storage Svc, 4 months (11/10/01 - 3/10/01), Total Value = $240,000 demand charge, plus minor commodity premium on injection gas
- Guarantee:  $5 million total (I think we can get this lowered somewhat, maybe $3 million)
- Per Rudwell Johnson in Credit, WPS will only accept a surety bond from Enron.  Otherwise, 100% guarantee from Peoples.
Options:
1 - Issue Peoples an LC for Enron's portion of the guarantee
2 - Accept a sharing percentage different than 50/50.  75/25 may work, but some in their shop are pushing for as high as 90/10.  This sets an extremely dangerous precedent for future deals and may have negative implications for the long term viability of enovate.  I am concerned about the message this will send.  
3 - Let the deal blow up and force People's hand through the restricted activities language of the operating agreement.  This has obvious downsides from customer perception to the potential unwinding of enovate.

I have suggested many other options but they have not been receptive to them.  For instance, only issue an LC if we are rated junk.  

NRG
- Fuel managment services for testing phase of a combined cycle plant, Term: 11/20/01 - 3/31/02, Total Value = $100,000 demand charge, plus variable charges based on usage.
- Guarantee:  They have not given us a number yet.  They have initially indicated they will not take Enron credit.  Rudwell will be contacting them today to determine if they will take Enron credit and what the amount will be.
Options:
Same as above

Other Third Party Business
Counterparty		Service				Term 					Total Demand Charge
Wisconsin Gas		10 day Storage Service			3 yrs (4/1/02 - 3/31/05)			$1,100,000
Wisconsin Gas		50 day Storage Service			3 yrs (4/1/02 - 3/31/05)			$3,375,000
TXU			Storage Service				1 yr (4/1/02 - 3/31/03)			$   990,000
Oneok			Storage Service				1 yr (4/1/02 - 3/31/03)			$   875,000 
PG&E			Storage Service				1 yr (4/1/02 - 3/31/03)			$   840,000
PanCanadian		Storage Service				1 yr (4/1/02 - 3/31/03)			$   402,500

None of the above counterparties have explicitly stated they will not take Enron credit yet.  Wisconsin Gas has called and expressed concern over Enron, particularly given the term.  TXU has also called and tried to wiggle a little bit on the deal as a result of Enron's situation.  We have put them off for the time being.  Hopefully, we have enough time before the above deals start to reassure them of our credit.  

Let me know if you have further questions and I will keep you posted.

Thanks - Gregg

Louise:  Who in HR is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of the list?  We can verify that they are still with the company and that they are still getting paid, but knowing the source of the list you refer to from HR and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the communication problem.  --Sally

Before I draft a response, I wanted to clarify that Section 3.0 of Schedule "C" to the Contracting Party Agreement governing NGX provides for the determination of unsecured credit availability, which is essentially a collateral threshold, for investment grade counterparties or counterparties that have provided an investment grade guarantee, which can be determined in the sole discretion of NGX, but with a maximum for BBB credits of Cdn. $30 million (the previous maximum for BBB+ credits was Cdn. $35 million).  

Accordingly, it is arguable that NGX can apply whatever unsecured credit threshold it chooses, however, arguably, it must do so acting in a commercially reasonable manner and having regard to its equitable treatment of similar graded credits.  Accordingly, I will draft a response on this basis, imposing an obligation on NGX to treat us reasonably and equitably, but in the meantime, I believe that we should be taking steps to satisfy NGX's credit requirements both by providing the margin they require and by having the traders minimize their position to the extent possible.

I will forward a draft response shortly.

Regards,
Peter

I think so - respond rejecting his statements on ENE and state we expect fair treatment with other BBB credits.  Meanwhile we'll send the margin - our guys should be able to minimize the position.

Hi Randy, Bill.

As per our discussion this afternoon Randy,

Enron Corp. (Enron) has deteriorated further in the market place and the
recent downgrade of Enron by S&P to BBB, although not completely a surprise,
is still disconcerting.  I applaud Enron's effort in obtaining additional
Bank lines to shore up liquidity but am disappointed that your Pipeline
assets had to be pledge in support of same.  Additionally, Moody's and S&P
have stated publicly that further downgrade is possible.

I would like to remind you that NGX does not provide any unsecured lines to
entities who are rated below BBB.

As you well know, given NGX's size and the fact that NGX needs to keep the
integrity of the exchange intact, we have no option but to inform you of the
following.

Accordingly, please be advised that EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY Enron Canada Corp
(ECC) will no longer have any unsecured lines here at NGX (reference
attached Contracting Party's Agreement, Schedule C, para 3.0.a).

We respectfully request that ECC provide Collateral (preferably Irrevocable
Letter of Credit, else Registered Interest in Cash) by the close of business
day Monday, November 5, 2001 (reference Contracting Party's Agreement,
Schedule C, para 8.1).

As I said, if some other counterparty was in the position you are in right
now, you would expect us to do what it takes to keep the exchange
safe/intact/whole at all times.

Please call if you have any questions.

Here is a 19-month template for the forecast that is due tomorrow at 9:00 am


 
The numbers in the sheet represent what was shown to the DIP lenders last weekend in order to obtain  financing. In many cases all revenues and other items were completely eliminated leaving only operating expense and capital expenditures. We were trying to be as conservative as possible but also show a viable entity going forward. I hope we were not to far off.

What we would like you to do is populate this format with the numbers you believe to be true going forward based on the recent changes. We also need a detailed explanation of what is in the numbers. A few things to remember are:

	This estimate should contain no allocations except for what you believe you salaries and wages would be post reduction (normally paid by Corp)

	Operating expenses includes salaries, outside services, benefits, employee expenses and any other items normally in operating expenses including 
		non employee expenses and taxes other than income taxes.  Please provide as much detail as possible.  There is space for detailed opex at 		the bottom of the page.Call me if you have questions.

	Although in Chapter 11 interest and income taxes are not paid, please provide these to the extent your business unit pays them. We will adjust for 
		entities that are in the filing.

	I understand there is a big global effort to identify assets for sale but please provide your best estimate to date along with the detail and we will 		compare to the global effort.

	Capex and investing should be mandatory only. Please provide detail back up.
	
	To the extent your business has any financing activities please provide. again we will adjust for filing entities.

	We need this as soon as possible but no later than Friday morning 9:00 am.

This should be a realistic view of your business unit as run under Chapter 11. We are only focused on CASH items now. Please provide backup detail for any 
item you think needs it or is not self evident. Please do not hesitate to call myself 3-3887 or Mike Deville at 5-7852 with questions.

Subject:	CASH & REORG FINANCIAL REPORTING

Re:  CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION
        FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS



Many people have questions regarding how Enron will be operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.  This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. 

During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.

In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents.  Specifically, Enron will  be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis.  The court and our new debtor-in-possession ("DIP") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows.  The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections.  The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows.  Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.

The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company.  In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron.  However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.

The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887).  In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.

We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.  We will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements.

Attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required .  Please review this template in advance of the Wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format.  Obviously the requirements may change, which will require us to reformat and/or obtain additional information on short notification.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  We look forward to your attendance on Wednesday.

With respect to my assignments  JP Morgan and Dominion -

There is apparently some confusion regarding whether a Master Netting Agreement should be prepared for the J.P. Morgan group or for the Morgan Stanley group.  We have been unable to obtain confirmation regarding the correct entities.  

For Dominion, I await the Master Physical agreements from Canada and the credit information from Credit.  Other agreements have been reviewed and the form of Master Netting Agreement marked up with the information available.

Dan Staines and Joe Conner focus on Wholesale activities, you can work this out with Rick/Jim. I'm fine with the rest.

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Yep.

Jim has asked me to do some accounting stuff for him - but unless I'm reading it wrong - this does not change our plan.

Let's talk, I'd obviously like to get things sorted.

Tammy,

I have approx. 100+ people principally on 5, but some remain on 6.  I believe it will tough, if not impossible to move everyone by Tuesday (I have no idea where Jim Fallon is planning on putting his wholesale group).  I have forwarded this email to Jim, and anticipate that he will deal with it.

Thanks,

Don

Don, 
I am working on the space plan for NETCO.  I need a bit of assistance to identify the estate folks that are currently seated on either 5 or 6. Due to the short lead time I am on a rather tight leash.  Phase one of the project would require moving the estate people either to another ECS floor or perhaps to ECN.  We would potentially schedule these moves for Tuesday evening.  

Please advise as soon as possible the names and preferred location (ECS or ECN) for your estate team.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Just when you thought it was safe............................

We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.

All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).

As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.

Thanks

Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. ("Enron") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron.

 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

Louise,

The overall idea seems logical as a method to leverage collateral received on profitable deals.
One additional benefit would be if this allowed us to use other securities as collateral that a counterparty would not accept (I'm not sure what kind of other securities we have).
I also think that for EnronOnline to continue it's success that in the medium term it will need some form of margining/collateral as part of the system, but you will have a better sense for weither this would be an issue in the US given a healthy Enron - it is an issue in Europe and with banks regardless.

Issues:
Big systems issue for implementing a same day mark to market and liquidity calculation accross all products on EnronOnline. Therefore, I assume this would be rolled out only on the highest volume products. This will increase the cost of each transaction.
Liquidity algorithm will be hard for counterparties to swallow as they will not want to post incremental capital.
Contract Issue - do you make the collateral part of all EnronOnline deals as if you don't it will be difficult to differentiate between counterparties.
Existing exposures - How do we assign the collateral rights on existing net exposures to VMAC. This will likely be a logistical issue as you must have many counterparties but if the high value ones are few it could be doable, but why would the counterparty agree as he should already have our collateral (e.g. LC) or this may require him posting more.
Timing - This might be implemented by end of Q1, but is unlikely to give you immediate benefit.
Cost - Am not sure what US brokerage is but this seems to be equivalent to 40% of brokerage as it is being paid on both sides. Does this destroy margins.
Threshold - Would there be a credit threshold as if not this would be very onnerous on all parties.

Quick win:
Effectively you are using collateral received to post collateral through a sleave. Would it not be possible to negotiate this directly with a counterparty given a select few who require high postings currently. In either case you would have to negotiate adjustment to collateral but if it can be done without a sleave but with a bigger haircut then you would avoid the delay in setting this up wholesale. I do not know if this is legally possible. 

I'll call to discuss and if you want me to do more detailed work let me know.

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Just to get things stirred up:  The estate will keep all the existing phone numbers and Netco will get brand new numbers.  Netco should not want the old Enron numbers (clean break, new company, etc.).  The estate cannot afford to switch numbers.   I know this was a hot point for you so I thought I would let you know directly instead of finding it in a document at the eleventh hour.

This spreadsheet should have everything for west power (Portland and San Fran) and for all people in Portland.  I have prepared it in a way so that it can be easily sorted.  Chris and I have reviewed and think that it is complete.

Jeanie, could you please ensure that the following people are on a netco list somewhere:
Dan Dietrich
Steve Walton
Murray O'Neil
Terry Donovan
Dale Furrow

Also, I think that Jeff Dasovich is slated to stay in San Fran to support the west gas desk.  I don't know if anyone has considered retention for him.

Finally, I put numbers down for the IT Development people in Portland.  I have no idea if those numbers are good or not.  Please run them by Steve Nat or compare them to someone in a similar role to see if they make sense.

PS - The outside e-mail address is my home e-mail so that I can review if you need me to discuss later.

Subject:	Update on SRP Margin Call
Importance:	High

Tim,

As you know, SRP made a margin call to EPMI on Monday, by letter, seeking $5.5 million in margin under a "one-off" contract.  Tracy and I sent a letter back on Tuesday, arguing that the contract does not permit SRP to call for additional margin unless ENE is downgraded to junk status.  SRP responded to our letter this afternoon.  Predictably, SRP disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin.  SRP says that it will treat our failure to post $5.5 million by Monday, November 12, in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit, as an event of default and will terminate the contract.  If this happens, EPMI would have to make a payment of $5.5 million within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from SRP.

As you know, Tracy and I strongly believe that the contract does not support SRP's right to call for margin at this time.  However, the contract is not perfect (they drafted it, after all) and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position.  

I recommend that we treat the SRP-EPMI dispute regarding the margining criteria under this Agreement as a "Dispute" under Section 17.  Disputes are first submitted to Authorized Representatives (each company designates an Authorized Representative) to resolve.  If the Authorized Representatives cannot reach agreement within 30 days, then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at SRP (the "Executives").  The Executives have to meet within 30 days to resolve the issue.  If the Executives cannot resolve the issue within 30 days, then both parties can choose arbitration, or either party can take the matter to court.  In summary, best case, this option gets us up to 90 days before we have to arbitrate/litigate the issue.  Otherwise, we better prepare to post collateral Monday.

If you want to handle this matter by taking the "Dispute" route, I should send a letter out tomorrow to SRP giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract's "Dispute" provisions.

Steve

(I should also mention that Tracy has informed me that SRP plans to issue a margin call on our WSPP contracts (approximately $4.5 million) as soon as it calculates the amount due.)

John and Louise						,

I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in mind.

I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus.  I will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks.  A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp.  I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues.  Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.

Let me know if you would like any more information.  You can reach me at 3-6401 or on my cell at 713-302-5522.

Michelle

Quick updates: spoke with larry lawyer at egm. Thinks they would take a $30-$40mm p&l hit to liquidate so2 position. Barclays returned our calls suggesting they would think about alternatives incl rolling deal as is and be back to us by 6am. Per deal, if we don't reach agreement by noon, we have to call credits for payment wednesday. Will let you know how call goes in morning. I understand that while bowen signed draw requests on thursday, legal had ok'd. Today, I understand legal is less comfortable. I've got a call into bowen. If he'll sign no issues with barclays. Will give you more shortly.

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the "market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets." He added: "It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets." 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. 

Under The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, "I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe." 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months," says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. "We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery." 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. "If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy," Dietert says. "In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow." 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, "Why? Ask why." 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  "I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, "and it's never
been in the news," said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. "My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion." 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  "Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit," Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  "I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance," Doot said. "Those things have in fact
happened from time to time."

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)
2001-10-26 16:18 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking "non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share," in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

Hi Randy, Bill.

As per our discussion this afternoon Randy,

Enron Corp. (Enron) has deteriorated further in the market place and the
recent downgrade of Enron by S&P to BBB, although not completely a surprise,
is still disconcerting.  I applaud Enron's effort in obtaining additional
Bank lines to shore up liquidity but am disappointed that your Pipeline
assets had to be pledge in support of same.  Additionally, Moody's and S&P
have stated publicly that further downgrade is possible.

I would like to remind you that NGX does not provide any unsecured lines to
entities who are rated below BBB.

As you well know, given NGX's size and the fact that NGX needs to keep the
integrity of the exchange intact, we have no option but to inform you of the
following.

Accordingly, please be advised that EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY Enron Canada Corp
(ECC) will no longer have any unsecured lines here at NGX (reference
attached Contracting Party's Agreement, Schedule C, para 3.0.a).

We respectfully request that ECC provide Collateral (preferably Irrevocable
Letter of Credit, else Registered Interest in Cash) by the close of business
day Monday, November 5, 2001 (reference Contracting Party's Agreement,
Schedule C, para 8.1).

As I said, if some other counterparty was in the position you are in right
now, you would expect us to do what it takes to keep the exchange
safe/intact/whole at all times.

Please call if you have any questions.

Following our Monday meeting, Bob Hall had Jeff Gossett and Stacey White coordinate with Commercial teams on data that they have provided to date in the due diligence process.  Outside of these risk related reports, Bob and his team have not provided reports or other documents to any of the potential suitors.  A few others on Bob Hall's team have had meetings with various due diligence teams and have discussed processes and controls, but again have not provided documents.  (I do, however, believe that in the case of at least one due diligence team that our monthly operations report was given to the due diligence team by someone outside Bob Hall's team.  I have not been able to confirm who within Enron provided that information.) 

I personally have not been involved in the majority of the due diligence process that has been conducted to date.  I had one brief meeting with Solomon Smith Barney, but did not provide them with any documents.  I have had two meetings with various team members with JPMorgan Chase, and again have not given them documents.  

Even though the only documents provided to date by the operations team have been risk related reports, we are compiling other information that supports discussions that the operations team has had with due diligence teams.  The compilation of that data should be completed today.  Since we had not provided documents (outside of risk reports) to due diligence teams, it has taken several days to canvas those who have had discussions with due diligence teams to create a complete list of items that have been covered verbally.  I am compiling 2 binders with this data, which includes the following:

	Operations Organization Charts 
	Operations Process Flows
	Monthly Operations Report
	Monthly Cash Collections Report
	Documentation Reports
	DPR template
	Risk Analytics Group's Functions
	Doorstep Reviews - Concept 
	2001 Reports from Doorstep Reviews 
		-Calgary
		-Denver
		-Portland
		-Houston Gas and Power

Attention Deal Compliance and Deal Validation:

New Procedure!!
Pursuant to Jeff Hodge's email below, effective Tuesday, November 6, for all counterparties with both a Master Firm contract and a GISB, all FIRM deals (EOL and telephonic), regardless of length (including one day deals) should be attached to the Master Firm contract.  With respect to EOL deals, Profile Manager has been updated to accommodate this change.

Stacey and Ellen:

	In light of current circumstances, if a counterparty has both a Master Firm and a GISB, please confirm all firm physical transactions (both telephonic and EOL) under the Master Firm and not the GISB.

	Additionally, could one of you provide me a list of EOL counterparties who have a GISB contract listed as their master agreement for EOL.

Thanks,

Jeff

Subject:	CASH & REORG FINANCIAL REPORTING

Re:  CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION
        FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS



Many people have questions regarding how Enron will be operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.  This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. 

During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.

In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents.  Specifically, Enron will  be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis.  The court and our new debtor-in-possession ("DIP") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows.  The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections.  The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows.  Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.

The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company.  In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron.  However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.

The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887).  In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.

We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.  We will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements.

Attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required .  Please review this template in advance of the Wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format.  Obviously the requirements may change, which will require us to reformat and/or obtain additional information on short notification.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  We look forward to your attendance on Wednesday.

Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

New Enron Employee Q&A

A new Q&A has been posted to <http://home.enron.com/updates/> based on recent developments and employee concerns.

Hi Louise,

Is this going to be the new name or is it a working name?  If it is the actual name, we can get the verisign registration done, and begin some graphics work.  Otherwise, I'll hold on that.

I spoke with Michelle last night and from our perspective we are OK with yo=
u going ahead today with the severance packages. I presume Louise or John h=
ave had a chance to look at names and the overall severance number.
=20
Dawn, you need to make sure Peter has checked severance calc logic, I have =
no way of checking whether this is reasonable. Obviously it is better than =
we have been able to do for people let go here and in London (which in of i=
tself is not a concern presuming Peter/Rob agree it's reasonable and in lin=
e with what other companies have done up there).
=20
On retention, I need to see list of proposed numbers. Ideally I'd like to h=
ave these paid with the other in Houston we are hoping to pay in the coming=
 weeks. I need to discuss with Louise/John whether they agree it is OK to g=
o ahead and do the Canadian ahead of time. In theory I agree.

=20
David,
I've attached the severance calculations for the Canada employees.  It's pr=
etty close to being finalized but I will be meeting with Milly in the morni=
ng for one last "kick at the cat."  Then, we'll start putting together pack=
ages i.e. letter, release, benefits information, Record of Employment, etc.=
  By the sound of it, Milly wants to conduct the terminations on Monday.  W=
e can pull packages together by then but we'll have to discuss the process =
to determine if we can handle that many in a "careful" manner. =20
=20
In a nutshell, my initial recommendation will be to have the supervisors me=
et with all the affected employees in their groups fairly early Monday morn=
ing and then have the employees meet with HR individually to discuss their =
packages (a schedule will be provided to each) and to answer any immediate =
questions.  Tricia and I should then be able to meet with all the affected =
employees before lunch.  While they wait to receive their packages, they ca=
n be cleaning out their personal belongings, saying their good-byes, etc.  =
The supervisors can be close by to monitor the situation to ensure things r=
emain controlled. I would try to pull together "talking points" to assist t=
he supervisors and spend some time with them to discuss what they need to s=
ay as well as what they need to be aware of and sensitive to. For the Toron=
to employees, I would have to coordinate with the supervisors and handle th=
e package discussion over the phone. I've thought about other ways to handl=
e this but this was the best solution I could come up with - any suggestion=
s you have would be welcome?. (Am I nuts to think we can get this done on M=
onday?!)
=20
We'll also get together first thing tomorrow morning to put some bonus numb=
ers together for the key employees that have not been paid yet.  And, I'll =
talk to him about the idea of forward payments for transition employees (Ca=
tegory 2).
=20
The Category "1" employees who have not been paid performance/retention bon=
uses include:
Biever, Jason=20
Lalani, Sean=20

Louise:

I just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e-mail. It seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation.

Basically all I want to tell you is that I'm here to help in this process, and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular I can help on. I have spoken and offered the same directly to Miller, Calger and Duran. I'm not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow. As I think you know, the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term, and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen (as evidenced by the $1.375 million Doyle insurance settlement finalized today). 

I'm approaching you and others specifically because I have 2 years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy experience. Prior to me joining Enron in May of 1998, I was with Kenetech Corporation (a 1,200 employee publicly traded IPP). In 1996 (after having worked as an Originator at Kenetech since 1990), Kenetech filed for Chapter 11. As part of the Chapter 11 process, I was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the Company to be responsible for liquidating the Company's assets. As such, I am very familiar with the Chapter 11 process, and how deals get done in this context. Enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude, but I believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable.

Again, as we go through this process, I just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area, and let you know that I stand ready, willing and eager to take on additional tasks.

With respect to our current deal flow, I also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which I will get to you by Friday (or earlier if need be):

1. Transaction list, status, and valuation;
2. Site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy;
3. Projected site bank maintenance budget.

I will, of course, also provide this information to Miller, Calger and Duran.

Best regards,

Ben

You are right.  ENA owns the intellectual property rights to EOL. 

Taylor just told me that and explained that the goal is to convey a license but to keep the IP in ENA for potential later sale.  

Also, we are preparing for a scenario that is North America gas and power in Houston, Calgary and Portland at about 50% flow going forward and the rest (EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, etc.) as orderly shutdown over 90 days.  I assume our front, mid and back office systems, or at least parts, would be conveyed to the new owner.

Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiati=
ng with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, a=
nd is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar w=
ith the matter.=20
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and =
head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence=
. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped =
out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reser=
ves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l=
ine, but said he couldn't supply any further details.=20
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal i=
n nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favo=
rite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi=
ncing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, i=
ts finances remain sound.=20
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th=
is month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 b=
illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions =
it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, An=
drew Fastow.=20
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consisten=
tly said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading o=
n the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. E=
nron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a S=
ept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that m=
oney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial p=
aper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Stan=
dard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was "getting a bit more resistanc=
e" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enro=
n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin=
g, he said.=20
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and=
 still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on ha=
nd would give it more financial flexibility.=20
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing=
 Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lowe=
r rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c=
onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last =
week could impair "Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital mark=
ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."=20
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are =
doing business with Enron on "essentially the same terms" as they have in t=
he past. "There has been no significant change in the credit conditions," h=
e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron =
would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's f=
inances.=20
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase=
 & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n=
ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to=
 show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. "Confid=
ence in this company was lost," said one bank official involved in the nego=
tiations for a new credit line. "But confidence will be restored."=20
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demons=
trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a=
ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.=
 Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu=
strates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark=
ets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man=
y of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a=
re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele=
ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking=
, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of=
 which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for=
 the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron=
's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l=
onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu=
es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues =
and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s=
elling stakes in energy producers.=20
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou=
nd 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation =
than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke=
 Energy.=20
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a "new economy" Web-ba=
sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac=
cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value=
d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan=
y's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p=
rice then.=20
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stra=
nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Califor=
nia's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stat=
ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic=
 scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's=
 troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the=
re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or=
 how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that=
 they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r=
eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f=
rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from =
energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how=
 -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan=
y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership=
. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a "senior officer of Enron is the m=
anaging member" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron "ma=
nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset=
s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars." It was=
, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market=
 -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin=
g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially =
when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he sev=
ered his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this yea=
r -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had bee=
n done.=20
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnershi=
p allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enro=
n relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion=
-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-foo=
ted hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission =
were left with many questions, and very few answers.=20
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y=
ear ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the co=
mpany. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea =
that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of =
the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of =
which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003=
.=20
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current r=
ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be se=
en, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and hero=
ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans=
parency.=20
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of=
 oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and r=
etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. =
It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house=
 -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 9, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure inve=
stors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions invol=
ving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billio=
n in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today.=20
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $=
3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off c=
ommercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to =
convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a c=
ash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or =
do business with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last t=
wo weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting=
 this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any ac=
tions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said.=20
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced=
 by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving it=
s former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last wee=
k. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and =
it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an i=
nquiry into its financial accounting.=20
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucia=
l to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. La=
tely, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and t=
wo major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the co=
mpany's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds=20
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mu=
tual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the hav=
oc may continue.=20
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embat=
tled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to =
fund tracker Morningstar.=20
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely =
to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's ha=
lving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders.=20
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholde=
r according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m s=
hares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn.=20
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at =
Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or =
5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last w=
eek on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships cre=
ated by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several l=
eading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron =
bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January.=
=20
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company i=
n which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with=
 large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are "dated", implying =
that the funds' positions in the company have changed.=20
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said manag=
ers of the group's larger funds had been "lightening up" their Enron holdin=
gs this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagshi=
p Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed=
 as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say wh=
en.=20
Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also dec=
lined to discuss his holdings, listed as 0.27 per cent of outstanding share=
s as of March 31. But Aim said the position had since been "trimmed substan=
tially".=20
Other top fund owners, as of the most recent filings, included the Alliance=

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, th=
e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-whee=
ling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-bas=
ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr=
ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-=
growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US S=
ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar dea=
ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic=
er, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily=
-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions =
as it answered about these "related-party transactions". The departure of A=
ndy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron =
has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed=
 it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20
"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side," observes Curt Launer=
, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete=
riorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor=
 relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial cultur=
e and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to=
 have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a =
cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "new economy" magic o=
n to old economy companies.=20
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey=
 Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to =
develop energy trading.=20
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat=
ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy un=
der-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling wh=
o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply=
ing it.=20
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always=
 been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more=
 likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer =
in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of =
his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackag=
ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A=
 management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president=
, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. E=
mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they d=
elivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: "It was =
all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."=20
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a "loose-tight" management m=
odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and M=
cKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b=
usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in=
 existing markets.=20
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. =
Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative forc=
e behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed=
 jobs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri=
sk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr =
Skilling once described the approach in this way: "As long as you clear you=
r deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you wa=
nt around here."=20
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets =
in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather deriv=
atives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c=
limatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. T=
he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world=
's leading e-commerce company.=20
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v=
enture with International Business Machines and America Online, the interne=
t service provider.=20
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive=
 of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most power=
ful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of =
America and Boeing.=20
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac=
hieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he=
 abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-heal=
th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan=
ation.=20
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to=
 avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron =
used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, =
the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a =
cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other =
financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust =
and Azurix. "They went after too many things too quickly," says Stephen Moo=
re of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparenc=
y. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi=
al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li=
ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks t=
o which it is exposed.=20
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many i=
nvestors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management=
: "The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne=
ed for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding som=
ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be =
questionable."=20
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. "The problems, in our view, =
stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski=
lls," argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Power plants =
in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail =
market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the interne=
t are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant e=
nergy business."=20
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s=
ome of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr=
on Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This hel=
ped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tr=
ading volumes failed to materialise.=20
"They over-promised on the new business they created," says Chris Bartlett,=
 a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the compan=
y. "Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br=
oadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."=20
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-th=
e-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant e=
nergy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B=
arney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent o=
f earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the p=
ast three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for di=
sposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty =
of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets.=
=20
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and =
credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man=
agement methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team =
will have to tighten up.=20

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - Enron asks banks for additional credit.
By SHEILA MCNULTY and GARY SILVERMAN.

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade b=
anks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fal=
l in its share price.=20
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board m=
eeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial di=
sclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its fi=
nancial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for=
 additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good fin=
ancial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have somet=
hing to announce in coming days from its latest effort to "establish additi=
onal lines of liquidity". "Once we are able to get the liquidity position s=
hored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest," Mr Palmer s=
aid.=20
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October =
16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders'=
 equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private=
 equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer,=
 who was forced to take a leave of absence last week.=20
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 a=
nnouncement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically =
"junk" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade.=20
"Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their abil=
ity to operate their trading and marketing operations," said Raymond Niles =
of Salomon Smith Barney. "These activities require at least an investment g=
rade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requ=
irements."=20
The controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a req=
uest for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron fli=

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.



USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.
By Janet McGurty

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of invest=
ors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural ga=
s now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its busin=
ess dealings.=20
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its cr=
edit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial trans=
actions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the =
past week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States i=
s not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the=
 market volatility that drove earnings last year eases.=20
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other p=
ower producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for s=
plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =
can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy.=20
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common them=
es affecting the industry.=20
"One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. A=
nd two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven g=
rowth," Patterson said.=20
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some po=
wer companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. An=
d plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off.=20
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on=
 the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.=20
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED=20
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consec=
utive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said=
 Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off=
 assets.=20
"It's a different place," AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of=
 the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powe=
rful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Balt=
imore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trad=
ing operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation =
also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which=
 planned to make an equity investment in the company.=20
"The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. econom=
y, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we wi=
ll be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver," said C=
hristian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman.=20
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES=20
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed empha=
sis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business=
.=20
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 8=
0 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it =
provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth,=
 according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise.=20
"Calpine does it already," he said, referring to the California-based indep=
endent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates c=
ontracted out. "What drove the valuations in all these companies last year =
was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were=
 low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case -=
 there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywh=
ere near that level," he added.=20
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices shoul=
d remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark sp=
reads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies.=20
SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES=20
As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning bac=
k to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line.=20
"Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 200=
2 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward re=
vision of earnings guidance." said Patterson.=20
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second t=
ime to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off cer=
tain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America.=20
CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge =
for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distr=
ibution units as well as other international investments.=20
Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in t=
hird quarter earnings.=20
The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards gett=
ing necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold it=
s unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time.=
=20
"The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstr=
ated value can and will be created for shareholders," Allegheny said.

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly ne=
gotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it dr=
ew down billions on its existing lines.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies wi=
th the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, w=
ith an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding "in addition=
 to derivatives and other structured product exposures," according to Goldm=
an Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loa=
n facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Secu=
rities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 m=
illion loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, =
the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also p=
articipated, Securities Data said.=20
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that "in order to dispel uncertainty =
in the financial community," it had drawn on its committed lines of credit =
to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal repor=
ted on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and =
was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line.=20
"We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity --=
 that's nothing out of the ordinary," said Enron spokesman Eric Thode.=20
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the de=
parture of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange C=
ommission inquiry.=20
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy=
 trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and s=
ervices, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines.=20
"Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested=
 along with Enron in some of its partnerships," said Ms. Applebaum. A spoke=
sman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did =
not know the amount of its exposure.=20
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. =
Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 milli=
on of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunT=
rust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, ac=
cording to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $10=
0 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also ha=
ve some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said.=20
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships wit=
h Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

10/29/2001

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd =
, said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy gian=
t Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant.=20
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate o=
f Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning the=
rmal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island=
 of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
"We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other =
than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power mar=
ket," a Teijin spokesman said.=20
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last =
year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers.=20
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reduci=
ng domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It=
 is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus.=20
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's exis=
ting power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at=
 the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron.=20
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefi=
ed natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become =
the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan.=20
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility s=
tudy by June 2002.=20
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron?=20
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant =
energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to pe=
rsuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Calif=
ornia to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its vie=
ws would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron=
's arrogance had grown even more quickly.=20
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and cons=
umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for elec=
tricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, =
Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the co=
mpany profited from creating new markets.=20
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing th=
ose who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''Peo=
ple want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It'=
s the American way.''=20
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron'=
s investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances ar=
e mounting.=20
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company=
 worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt=
ed and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enr=
on could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge =
hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998.=
 Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 bil=
lion in shareholder value.=20
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week lo=
w of $15.04 earlier in the day.=20
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and=
 soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ende=
d only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by interven=
ing deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making w=
ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci=
ty have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenn=
eth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, =
to resume day-to-day control of the company.=20
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, availabl=
e for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilli=
ng could not be reached.=20
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its=
 shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 bi=
llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E=
nron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission=
 is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors ques=
tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin=
g electricity and natural gas.=20
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall=
 in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chie=
f financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controve=
rsy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seem=
ed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today=
 faces a potential cash crunch.=20
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concer=
n about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts=
 and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran=
sactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to =
issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas=
h.=20
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On =
Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previousl=
y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, w=
hich have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's impor=
tance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that=
 any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.=20
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev=
en if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a p=
roducer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili=
ty of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.=20
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he tho=
ught Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what wou=
ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's Enr=
onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.=20
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are the=
y good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger sa=
id. ''It's got everyone scared.''=20
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the =
company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to iss=
ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee=
d. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va=
luable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th=
e company.=20
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy trader=
s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the co=
mpany's sales and profits.=20
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But =
its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now =
offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bon=
ds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Servic=
e and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possibl=
e downgrades.=20
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' =
said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at =
Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in=
 Kansas City, Mo.=20
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Rel=
iant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do busin=
ess with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electri=
city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r=
eminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.=20
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they=
 are closing their books down,'' he said.=20
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref=
ully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also =
said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly =
to discuss the situation.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading comp=
any had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any o=
f the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He =
said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.=20
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j=
ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, t=
he details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street =
analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who ow=
n its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creatin=
g lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impene=
trability of its financial statements.=20
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t=
o the questions investors ask.=20
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statem=
ents parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly =
regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect En=
ron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the g=
iant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited =
and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.=20
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr=
eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names=
 like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bon=
ds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water comp=
any subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed t=
he value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the=
 difference.=20
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial offic=
er when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in sharehold=
ers' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only sk=
impy details of its transactions with those partnerships.=20
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, =
after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a prom=
issory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' eq=
uity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transac=
tion was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.=20
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have =
found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen=
ts into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it=
 reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The e=
arnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-=
down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, a=
nd its shares rose.=20
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's=
 chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The referenc=
e was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those anal=
ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and=
 many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to sli=
de, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so=
 far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved=
 investors.=20
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain =
the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou=
t Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron w=
ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling a=
nd Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company.=20
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details a=
bout the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them=
, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.''=20
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a gra=
sp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking a=
bout them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot w=
e can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the c=
ompany expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by=
 the end of next year.=20
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enr=
on executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its o=
ther partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the dea=
l, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c=
ompany, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to cl=
arify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very=
 near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha=
t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company wi=
ll likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note=
 after the call.=20
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, it=
s Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day=
, a higher-than-normal volume.=20
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil=
ity with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay s=
aid in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strengt=
h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.''=20
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enr=
on's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six yea=
rs.=20
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance=
-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new =
shares to make good on its partnership guarantees.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates tha=
t Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said th=
at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign =
assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India =
embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about t=
hose prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring econom=
y.=20
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their =
backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wedne=
sday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.''=20
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when=
 management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said.=20
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disc=
losed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than an=
alysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money=
-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they s=
ay.=20
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core busine=
ss, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of r=
esearch at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May=
 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these =
transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that prof=
itable.''=20
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fa=
ll, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the=
 losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company st=
ood by its reported energy-trading profits.=20
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture=
 of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip=
ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr=
ading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, =
in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.=20
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that=
 they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist.=20
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an=
d disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully=
 lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform =
would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi=
on.=20
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale e=
lectricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track =
of specific transactions and prices.=20
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. E=
nron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one=
-quarter of all trading in the United States.=20
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e=
lectricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power busines=
s was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and=
 their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen =
by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independ=
ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ev=
er-growing portion of the nation's power.=20
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was als=
o deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline co=
mpany, to move into the trading business.=20
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1=
990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in Fe=
bruary, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the=
 change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its p=
rincipal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, i=
t had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum pr=
oducts.''=20
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall =
Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first=
 transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chi=
ef financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals=
 were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involve=
ment.=20
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit=
 lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have t=
o be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have t=
o pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its invest=
ment-grade credit rating before that.=20
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could s=
uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's cred=
it. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals s=
old the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term =
to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy ma=
rkets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that po=
sitions that should offset each other do not.=20
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact=
 the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the =
short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share=
 price, could rebound.=20
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take=
 advantage of Enron's plight.

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Cor=
poration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its ch=
ief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. B=
ecause they were transactions among related parties, the company was requir=
ed to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a=
nswered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the cu=
rrently available answers.=20
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it=
 said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other asse=
ts,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun=
ications companies.=20
Q. How did those investments do?=20
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclos=
ure on that.=20
Q. Why can't that be discerned?=20
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transacti=
ons with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivati=
ve securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial =
disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement=
s completely.=20
Q. Why were they so complicated?=20
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One a=
ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on =
transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each =
and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or los=
s. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in tha=
t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on =
the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fa=
ll under that rule.=20
Q. Who made money from these transactions?=20
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not a=
ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears=
 that the partnerships distributed money to investors.=20
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?=20
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything =
seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof=
its each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being discl=
osed was not really important.=20
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?=20
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By th=
is summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partne=
rships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate=
d to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the=
 transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out=
 its deals with the partnerships.=20
Q. How did Enron do?=20
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transact=
ions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it als=
o reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20
Q. How did that happen?=20
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnershi=
p owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr=
on. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligatio=
ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a s=
hare buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and d=
etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re=
ported earnings.=20
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?=20
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to =
say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to=
 enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on t=
hem. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, w=
hich has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take
a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity
by another $1.2 billion, the FT said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would
announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper
said.

HOUSTON is known as the "Energy Capital of the World." And a glance around =

Now another name is being added to the downtown mix, enhancing the energy c=

evon Energy Tower.
Devon Energy has just signed a lease for 193,000 square feet of space, more=
 than doubling its presence in the building, and as part of the deal, Devon=
 gets to put its name on the structure.=20
The lease also gives Oklahoma City-based Devon the right to take more space=
 in the 1 million-square-foot building, at 1212 Smith St.=20
Devon recently announced its plans to acquire Mitchell Energy & Development=
, but it will maintain Mitchell's offices in The Woodlands, said Klay Kimke=

Kevin Snodgrass and Tim Relyea of Cushman & Wakefield represented Devon in =

TrizecHahn owns both the Allen Center and Cullen Center office complexes, a=

ML Capital, which has been in business for eight months, will exceed Luecht=

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liqui=
dity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, u=
sing $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit.=
=20
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are comp=
leted the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell=
 to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before =
ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents.=20
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks nor=
mally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market=
, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion.=
=20
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below inves=
tment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an e=
arly default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will =
be able to sell more commercial paper.=20
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed t=
hat its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will sho=
w a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated=
 transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, =
who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wedn=
esday.=20
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement=
, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 has asked questions about its accounting practices.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning lev=
els.
By ROBERT CLOW, SHEILA MCNULTY and JENNY WIGGINS.

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy pri=
ce for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plum=
meted.=20
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announc=
ed a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-bal=
ance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launc=
hed an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar wi=
th a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices a=
t these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for=
 bankruptcy.=20
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to b=
uy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the=
 company on negative watch.=20
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, =
is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis.=20
"What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners th=
at they are creditworthy and continue with business," said Robin West, chai=
rman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. "In a situ=
ation like this, cash is king."=20
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterpa=
rties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more =
collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business.=20
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that.=20
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up wel=
l. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company co=
uld still be severely damaged by the scandal.=20
Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its m=
ost recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fasto=
w, the company's former chief financial officer.=20
Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure =
by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity inve=
stments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a =
certain level.=20
Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which shou=
ld have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed=
.=20
The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the sam=
e balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered fr=
om marking their private equity investments to market.=20

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trade=
r tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leadi=
ng market for low-interest, short-term loans.=20
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors ques=
tioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financi=
al officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York St=

Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that=
 the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in co=
mmercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks=
 offer.=20
"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassa=
dy, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People ar=

The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial =
paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.=20
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 point=
s to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that pric=

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to c=

.=20
In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that =
continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies t=

"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wro=

Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in H=

The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would prov=

Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other s=

On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if i=

The lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the MSN service in all but=

han waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactl=
y zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (thoug=
h one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). T=
he Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had beg=
un until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpet=
ed breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcem=
ent that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New J=
ersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary=
-school children again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E=
.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things Tha=
t Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not every=
thing changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-=
front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion =
but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20.=20
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particular=
ly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the=
 right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic pr=
udence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck=
, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe=
edily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmac=
eutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a pa=
nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's Hous=
e ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston=
 energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush =
campaign cash machine.=20
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since =
Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, Ser=
viceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates,=
 is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat c=
ats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Ha=
ll Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration =
in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in=
 the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thous=
ands of their employees.=20
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland =
security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac=
k to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri=
dge.=20
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a=
 large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam.=
 A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administratio=
n from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job=
s, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right be=
cause he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the =
administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- w=
ho have brought us where we are today.=20
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those=
 of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber=
 of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. As=
hcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perha=
ps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics overrid=
e public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen=
 no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat=
riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern.=
=20
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credi=
bility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along=
 with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin=
es it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibi=
lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance o=
f science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is req=
uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of=
 it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospita=
ls -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of a=
ll expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the=
 Republican Bill Frist.=20
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks=
 of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- =
David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of publi=
c health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointe=
e, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r=
eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr.=
 Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula=
g.=20
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati=
on about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, whic=
h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n=
ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has s=
ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve=
r been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Gl=
azier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even thou=
gh her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army =
of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international=
 and domestic terrorism.''=20
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops=
 offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication=
 of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't r=
espond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she add=
s, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple =
of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'=
' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents).=20
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service=
s inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, the=
re wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R=
. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first =
place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of hom=
eland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 governmen=
t agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to defi=
ne Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa=
s ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing s=
till more confusion.=20
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Broka=
w -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to=
 shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers.=
 That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision fo=
r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly =
codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment.=20
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we ca=
n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the =
war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali=
ban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their =
intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''inst=
ead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appear=
s to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.''=20
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because =
the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a=
 C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol=
itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & S=
houlders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reass=
uring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares=
 worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunc=
h that has left the company's credibility in ruins.=20
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold=
 about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held =
2.8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors=
 who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by =
July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron de=
clined to comment on the share sales.=20
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the=
 financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enr=
on's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep =
another $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us=
 if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."=20
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission in=
to partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer.=
=20
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to r=
estore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong.=20
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed in=

INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3.

10/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned b=
y Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of r=
eviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday.=20
They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buy=
ing the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. f=
irms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial pr=
oject, the source told Reuters.
The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank an=
d Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added.=20
At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which =
is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 millio=
n investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel.=20
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from =
India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast.=20
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the se=
cond phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped =
in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility =
MSEB.=20
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can n=
o longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly.=20
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and ser=
ved a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract.=20
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the m=
atter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a =
final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That=
 six month period expires on November 19.=20
Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced tha=
t it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indi=
an government.=20
TIME RUNNING OUT=20
The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would als=
o discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after Novem=
ber 19.=20
"It is one of the items on the agenda," the paper quoted a senior banker as=
 saying.=20
The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to =
arbitration, which would not help India.=20
"The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a sit=
uation DPC will win hands down," the paper added.=20
A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately.=20
The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the=
 dispute so far.=20
The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity,=
 but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interes=
t.=20
They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if th=
e founders agree to sell their stake at a discount.=20
Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power=
 and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 perc=
ent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel.=20
Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less t=
han $1 billion, the paper added.=20
Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment=

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for br=

Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing th=

Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to o=
ffer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential custo=

aking a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner.=20
"We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and=
 at the same time we are evaluating other providers," Visse said.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing co=
mpany policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest=
 energy trader.=20
Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for M=
SN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver o=
perational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing =

Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering a=

NEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to millio=

The decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community tha=
t Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Micros=
oft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other bro=

SEC Seeks Information on Enron Dealings With Partnerships Recently Run by F=

By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. said it has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion seeking information on the energy giant's controversial dealings with=
 partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financia=
l officer, Andrew S. Fastow.=20
Following Enron's announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry, the co=
mpany's stock took another big slide, falling more than 20% in New York Sto=
ck Exchange trading. As of 4 p.m., Enron shares were trading at $20.65, off=
 $5.40, knocking about $4 billion off Enron's market capitalization. Volume=
 topped the Big Board's most-active list at about 36 million shares. A week=
 ago, Enron stock was trading at about $33 a share. Subsequently, the compa=
ny announced a $1.01 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 m=
illion loss.
Analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurki=
ng amid Enron's vast and extremely complex operations. The company has deal=
ings with a number of related entities. Under certain circumstances, if Enr=
on's credit rating and stock price fall far enough, the company would be ob=
ligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities, d=
iluting the holdings of current shareholders.=20
Enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is s=
trong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults.=20
In a statement, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the com=
pany "will cooperate fully" with the SEC inquiry and "look(s) forward to th=
e opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." Enron h=
as consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastow-related =
partnerships were proper and properly disclosed. The company has said it pu=
t billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership-related transact=
ions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions.=20
The SEC inquiry came from the agency's Fort Worth, Texas, regional office. =
According to a person familiar with the matter, this would indicate that th=
e inquiry comes from the SEC's enforcement arm, as opposed to its corporate=
-finance section. The participation of the enforcement branch would indicat=
e that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of=
 securities law. However, enforcement-branch inquiries often don't produce =
any allegations of wrongdoing. It also appears that the SEC hasn't yet take=
n the step of launching a formal investigation, which would be a sign that =
the agency believes securities laws might have been violated. The SEC decli=
ned to comment.=20
Certainly, there have been questions and concerns about those partnership t=
ransactions, which contributed to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder e=
quity last week as part of Enron's efforts to unwind the deals. Mr. Fastow,=
 who has declined repeated interview requests, resigned from the partnershi=
ps, known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, in late July in the f=
ace of rising conflict-of-interest concerns by Wall Street analysts and maj=
or company investors.=20
Since then, internal partnership documents have shown that Mr. Fastow and p=
erhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in =
fees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM2, the larger of th=
e two partnerships.=20
Mr. Fastow's partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron, =
according to people familiar with the matter. For instance, these people sa=
y, sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999, Enron Treasurer=
 Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained =
about potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr. Fastow's activities. Mr.=
 Skilling didn't share Mr. McMahon's concern, these people say, and Mr. McM=
ahon requested and received reassignment to another post.=20
Mr. Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in mid-August,=
 citing personal reasons and the fall in Enron's stock price, which peaked =
at about $90 a share last year. Mr. McMahon and Mr. Skilling haven't respon=
ded to repeated interview requests.=20
Investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enron's de=
alings with other related entities. In some cases, Enron could be required =
to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if c=
ertain so-called double trigger provisions occur.=20
For example, last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II, which=
 sold $915 million in notes that are due July 15, 2003. However, Enron can =
be considered in default, in advance of that date, if its stock price falls=
 below $34.13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to b=
elow investment grade by either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poo=
r's.=20
Currently, Enron debt is still investment-grade at both ratings agencies an=
d would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment =
grade category. Last week, Moody's put Enron on review for a possible downg=
rade. However, observers believe that even if Moody's lowers Enron's rating=
, the company will still be investment-grade.

Where Did the Value Go at Enron?
By FLOYD NORRIS
New York Times
What really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders e=
ver seen?
Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/=
marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=3Dhttp://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/=
html-companyprofile.asp&symb=3DENE>) released its quarterly earnings a week=
 ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company=
 said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the tran=
sactions.
The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been =
raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured =
in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a pr=
eliminary inquiry.
Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the =
slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confron=
t a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet valu=
e to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as=
 investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they =
have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.
The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a n=
ews release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was bri=
efly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listener=
s seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's c=
hairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that w=
as disclosed in the earnings release.
When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less=
 than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity =
was related to the termination of "structured finance vehicles" involving p=
artnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial offic=
er.
"Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how=
 the company goes about its business," said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit anal=
yst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's "c=
redibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its o=
wn."
Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its=
 financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another confe=
rence call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today.=20
The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many a=
nalysts. They referred to such things as "share settled costless collar arr=
angements" and "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent natu=
re of existing restricted forward contracts." The disclosures said the comp=
any entered into the transactions "to hedge certain merchant investments an=
d other assets."
It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the=
 underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall St=
reet Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investo=
rs, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distri=
butions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to =
discuss the arrangements in any detail.
One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the terminati=
on of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, =
or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earni=
ngs. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot p=
roduce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company th=
at sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will=
 report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders e=
quity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, "is the result of Enron=
's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver En=
ron shares in future periods."
Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron'=
s debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the deta=
ils were not clear, "Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount=
 of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and the=
y were not" worth that much.
Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expense=
s, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed on=
ly in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in sh=
areholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, =
which has yet to be released.
Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted =
strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to p=
rovide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the que=
stioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling late=
r resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman=
 and former chief executive, took back the latter title.
While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were=
 generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the domi=
nant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phe=
nomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important ro=
le in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was o=
nly enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.
But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into proble=
ms, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the compan=
y's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was be=
cause of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wond=
ered if there might have been similar deals with others.
Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to unde=
rstand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for do=
ing just that.
In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s=
 request for information. "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look=
 forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to =
rest," he said.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION: SEC probes Enron over financial dealings=20
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By JULIE EARLE, JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron, the US energy giant, disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start=
 of an informal inquiry.=20
The announcement follows a rapid sell-off in the stock in reaction to Enron=
's surprise revelation last week of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eli=
minate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing v=
ehicles.=20
In revealing the SEC call for more detailed information "regarding certain =
related party transactions", Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that =
it should be more transparent. "We welcome this request," said Kenneth Lay,=
 Enron chairman and chief executive officer. "We will co-operate fully with=
 the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these=
 transactions to rest."=20
The SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this st=
age, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. =
However, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information=
 on an issue.=20
Such a probe could turn into a formal investigation at any time. In that ca=
se, regulators would be armed with subpoena powers and could demand certain=
 documents be handed over. The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence =
of the Enron probe.=20
Mr Lay did not say which transactions the SEC was reviewing, although analy=
sts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow, Enron chief financial officer, wh=
o has been reported to have run a limited partnership that bought assets va=
lued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron.=20
Analysts say the transactions, while controversial because of Mr Fastow's l=
inks to the company, have been disclosed. What concerns them, however, is h=
ow Enron valued the assets involved. www.ft.com/energy=20

Ronald Barone joked he would have to get plenty of rest ahead of Enron's re=
sults last week, noting the US energy company's reputation for producing wh=
at some analysts say is the most complicated of earnings reports.=20
The UBS Warburg analyst was, nevertheless, as ill-prepared as his peers for=
 the announcement of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilu=
tive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles.=20
The news overshadowed Enron's on-target 26 per cent increase in third-quart=
er earnings per share, sending the stock plunging.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission's subsequent request for more inform=
ation about Enron's financial activities has reinforced analyst perceptions=
 that the company should have been more transparent in its reporting.=20
Curt Launer, of Credit Suisse First Boston, says expectations for more disc=
losure had built up over the past two months. Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, =
had promised to be more forthcoming when he resumed the duties of chief exe=
cutive following the resignation of Jeff Skilling in August.=20
While Mr Lay did improve Enron's disclosure by creating headings for new bu=
siness segments and providing more detail within each of them, the Dollars =
1.2bn charge still caught the market off guard.=20
"It came as a surprise to us," said Stephen Moore, of Moody's Investors Ser=
vice. "We should have been informed that it was there."=20
Mr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in "a fleetin=
g comment" during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it =
in its nine-page news release.=20
"Despite progress in other areas, there appears to be much more work ahead =
before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the=
 past are fully resolved," he said.=20
Enron contends that "we did disclose it in the conference call, and it was =
one of the first points raised in the Q and A session (on the conference ca=
ll)".=20
Mr Lay has pledged to co-operate with the SEC's request, which appears to b=
e part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation. In the=
 meantime, he adds, Enron will focus on its core businesses.=20
That is something analysts say Enron has strayed too far away from. Ray Nil=
es of Salomon Smith Barney says the company's core franchise - its wholesal=
e business - is doing well. Most of Enron's problems have arisen from stepp=
ing out of this area.=20
"They need to come clean on the financial effects of all of their off-balan=
ce sheet financing," Mr Niles says. "Investors want to see clear, easy-to-u=
nderstand financial information." Moody's has placed Enron's Dollars 13bn i=
n debt securities on review for possible downgrade and Mr Moore believes th=
ere is potential for more write-offs.=20
Enron is embroiled in a legal dispute with an Indian state electricity boar=
d over a power project and is one of several energy traders facing question=
s in California over accusations of a manipulation of power prices - a char=
ge it denies.=20
Analysts say its UK businesses are not seeing big multiples, and Enron says=
 it only expects to take Dollars 200m in "goodwill" versus Dollars 5.7bn on=

Enron Discloses SEC Inquiry=20
Information Request Involves Ties to Money-Losing Partnerships=20
Washington Post
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, October 23, 2001; Page E03=20
Enron Corp. shares sank more than 20 percent yesterday after the Houston en=
ergy company disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission request for inf=
ormation about Enron's ties to outside investment partnerships set up by th=
e company's chief financial officer.
The SEC would not comment on its action, which Enron spokesman Mark Palmer =
called an "informal inquiry," not an investigation. "We welcome this reques=
t," said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of the Houston-based =
company.
But the announcement jarred investors' confidence in the giant energy-tradi=
ng company, already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive J=
effrey K. Skilling in August, and heavy losses from investments in broadban=
d Internet and other technology ventures.
"A lot of people threw in the towel today," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst =
with J.P. Morgan in New York.
The SEC request was made privately last Wednesday, the day after Enron repo=
rted a $1 billion write-off of investment losses and restructuring charges =
from unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations. The write-offs =
left Enron with a $618 million loss in the third quarter (84 cents a share)=
.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that $35 million of the write-of=
f was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enron's chief f=
inancial officer, Andrew Fastow, and run by him until July.
Enron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased 55 million=
 shares of its stock held by the partnerships that Fastow had directed, red=
ucing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow set up several investment part=
nerships with the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships engaged in bi=
llions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and mad=
e major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron.
An Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enro=
n's board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financia=
l officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned milli=
ons of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships.=
 What Enron received from the relationships is not clear.
Feygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partne=
rships, which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncert=
ain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financ=
ial statements.=20
"In hindsight, that was an error in judgment. I don't think it was an error=
 in principle," the analyst said.
Enron could have revealed the SEC inquiry last week but did not disclose it=
 until yesterday, and for many investors, that was the last straw, Feygin s=
aid.
The stock closed yesterday at $20.65, down $5.40, as 36 million shares chan=
ged hands.

Enron Suffers After Unclear Disclosure, New York Times Says
2001-10-23 06:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission's decision to look into some Enron Corp.
transactions and the company's recent decline in value show what
can happen when a company lets a major reduction in its balance
sheet dribble out, Floyd Norris of the New York Times reported in
his column, citing analysts.

     Investors are concerned as to how Enron reduced shareholders'
equity by $1.2 billion and why this was not mentioned in a news
release the company issued with its quarterly earnings last
Tuesday, the paper said.

     Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent yesterday after the
Houston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission
requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Enron created
partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets
such as power plants to lower the debt on its books.

     ``Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more
clarity about how the company goes about its business,'' said
Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service,
according to the Times.

SEC asks Enron for investing data=20
Stock price declines as regulators seek details on partnerships=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Shares in Enron Corp. fell almost 21 percent Monday after the company discl=
osed federal securities regulators asked for details on investment partners=
hips formerly run by its chief financial officer.=20
The request covers transactions between Enron and two private partnerships,=
 LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that did business with Enron.=20
The partnerships entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements wi=
th Enron.=20
Enron declined to say if the SEC's request -- which it called voluntary and=
 said represents an "informal inquiry" -- included other issues.=20
The SEC request, made by fax Wednesday to Enron and followed up with a call=
 Thursday, comes as the Houston-based energy trader was already fighting to=
 put a series of problems behind it and regain credibility with investors a=
nd analysts.=20
"It's further bad news, further question marks related to Enron in general =
and this transaction specifically," Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzban=
k Securities in New York, said of the SEC request.=20
Some investors prefer to sit on the sidelines until the issue clears up, Me=
ade said, adding: "The level of uncertainty with this stock has gotten pret=
ty high."=20
An SEC spokesman declined comment.=20
Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, managed both of the LJM par=
tnerships, according to SEC filings made by Enron last year.=20
Both partnerships are described as investment companies that primarily buy =
or invest in businesses involved in energy and communications.=20
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM partnerships in June amid criticism =
and questions from some on Wall Street about a potential conflict of intere=
st.=20
Investors worried Monday that Fastow's duty to Enron shareholders competed =
with his duties to LJM, Meade said.=20
In a written statement Monday, Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executiv=
e officer, said the company welcomed the SEC's request.=20
"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity t=
o put any concern about these transactions to rest," said Lay, who reassume=
d the duties of CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned unexpectedly in August.=20
Enron said its external and internal auditors and attorneys reviewed the ar=
rangements, its board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, =
which were disclosed in Enron's SEC filings.=20
The issue drew renewed interest from investors and analysts after Enron rel=
eased third-quarter earnings last Tuesday.=20
During the quarter, Enron took $1.01 billion in one-time charges to reflect=
 losses in its broadband, retail electricity and water investments.=20
The amount also included $35 million related to "early termination" of Enro=
n's relationships with the LJM partnerships.=20
During a call with analysts the same day, Enron said it recorded a $1.2 bil=
lion reduction to shareholder equity, or the shareholders' ownership stake =
in the company, as part of the LJM termination.=20
Enron declined to answer questions Monday about the LJM entities, including=
 those about their relationship with Enron or Fastow's role with them.=20
The day after Enron's third-quarter earnings release, the Wall Street Journ=
al ran the first of three articles highlighting the LJM partnerships, Fasto=
w and Enron.=20
The Journal's Friday report said LJM2 "realized millions of dollars in prof=
its in transactions it did with Enron," and that "Fastow, and possibility a=
 handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year=
 in management fees."=20
Shares in Enron, which closed last Tuesday at $33.84, ended the day Friday =
at $26.05. Then Monday, shares in Enron dropped by $5.40 to close at $20.65=
.=20
Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York, believes there were=
 no improprieties surrounding LJM.=20
"From inception, the LJM situation was obviously one that would raise eyebr=
ows," said Feygin, adding Enron anticipated that and made sure proper legal=
 structures were in place.=20
The LJM entities are what's known as off-balance sheet financing vehicles, =
he said. Generally, they allow a corporation to take on financial obligatio=
ns without having to report them as liabilities.=20
Feygin also said it appeared Enron intended to give Fastow an "opportunity =
to participate in the upside from these entities" to reward him.=20
Even though the LJM transactions have been disclosed by Enron, Meade noted =
that they are complicated, difficult to follow and their implications tough=
 to understand.=20
In transactions detailed in an SEC filing made by Enron last year, LJM Caym=
an received shares of Enron common stock and LJM2 acquired assets from Enro=
n.=20
Another filing last year said LJM Cayman and/or LJM2 acquired various debt =
and equity securities of certain Enron subsidiaries and affiliates.=20
Investors are also concerned about potential shareholder lawsuits as well a=
s equity commitments facing Enron from two other financing vehicles called =
Whitewing and Marlin, Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. Internati=
onal in Houston, wrote in a research note Monday.=20
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, thos=
e equity commitments from Whitewing and Marlin could trigger steps that wou=
ld cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted.=
=20
At least two shareholders have already sued Enron's board in state district=
 court, while two law firms filed suit on behalf of Enron shareholders Mond=
ay in federal court seeking class-action status.=20
Carol Caole, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded E=
nron from a buy to a hold Monday primarily because of issues surrounding th=
e credibility of Enron's management.=20
Several times over the past six months, Caole asked specific questions of s=
enior Enron executives, she said. They denied problems existed, but six wee=
ks to two months later it was revealed there were, indeed, issues, she said=

Minnesota Mining and GM Climb In a Rally That Builds Late in Day

NEW YORK -- During yesterday's Wall Street rally, investors responded with =
accommodation toward the release of third-quarter earnings results and four=
th-quarter forecasts.=20
Shares of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing added $5.22, or 5.1%, to $107.39=
 after the manufacturing company released third-quarter earnings, which nar=
rowly edged out analysts' projections, and spoke frankly of the challenges =
the company continues to face this quarter in light of economic weakness.
Despite this kind of hesitation about the economy's outlook, investors grav=
itated toward some of the manufacturing and capital-equipment stocks that t=
end to struggle during periods of weak economic activity. Shares of General=
 Motors, for example, added 1.21, or 2.9%, to 42.57, Alcoa gained 1.16, or =
3.7%, to 32.83, and Fluor, an engineering and construction company, rose 1.=
79, or 4.2%, to 44.77.=20
Stock averages initially struggled for direction, reflecting some skepticis=

irmly higher in the final two hours of trading. Trading levels thinned out,=
 as well; on the New York Stock Exchange, less than 1.1 billion shares chan=
ged hands, compared with 1.2 billion shares Friday, an options-expiration s=
ession.=20
Nevertheless, market averages posted impressive gains. The Dow Jones Indust=
rial Average improved 172.92 points, or 1.88%, to 9377.03. The Nasdaq Compo=
site Index gained 36.77 points, or 2.2%, to 1708.08.=20
"We had another one of those days where there is a lack of liquidity, so an=
y moves, in either direction, just get exaggerated," Bob Basel, senior trad=
er at Salomon Smith Barney, said yesterday.=20
Shares of semiconductor companies, including makers of both chips and chip-=
making equipment, rose sharply after a spending forecast from Intel, the le=
ading chip maker, proved less grim than some experts had anticipated. The c=
ompany said its capital spending could be cut 10% to 20% in 2002 from this =
year's levels; that wouldn't be as severe as some chip industry experts had=
 forecast.=20
Shares of Applied Materials advanced 2.22, or 6.8%, to 34.77 on Nasdaq, whi=

 2.57, or 7.1%, to 38.74, LSI Logic gained 89 cents, or 5.6%, to 16.83, and=
 Texas Instruments tacked on 1.17, or 4.2%, to 28.91. For its part, Intel r=
ose 1.15, or 4.8%, to 25.30 on Nasdaq.=20
Shares of Lexmark International dropped 5.58, or 11%, to 44.77. The Lexingt=
on, Ky., maker of computer printers reported third-quarter results that mat=
ched Wall Street's forecasts, but warned that it continues to face sluggish=
 demand in the fourth quarter.=20
SBC Communications declined 2.24, or 5.1%, to 41.40. The telecommunications=
 service provider reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analys=
ts' forecasts, and warned that the company won't show "meaningful growth" n=
ext year.=20
Citrix Systems fell 4.14, or 16%, to 21.08 on Nasdaq. Dain Rauscher reduced=
 its rating on the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., maker of computer networking prod=
ucts, saying the company faces competitive pressures from products introduc=
ed by rival vendors.=20
Jabil Circuit eased 16 cents, or 0.7%, to 22.90. The St. Petersburg, Fla., =
contract electronics maker adopted a so-called shareholder rights plan, whi=
ch is aimed at preventing an acquirer from gaining control of the company.=
=20
EMC advanced 68 cents, or 5.9%, to 12.19. The Hopkinton, Mass., maker of da=
ta-storage systems signed what was described as a multibillion-dollar enter=
prise storage agreement with Dell Computer. Dell improved 50 cents, or 2.1%=
, to 24.55 on Nasdaq.=20
SeaChange International advanced 88 cents, or 3.6%, to 25.03 on Nasdaq, boo=

Lucent Technologies declined 20 cents, or 2.8%, to 6.90. UBS Warburg, in a =

Enron lost 5.40, or 21%, to 20.65, setting a 52-week low. The Houston energ=

Milberg Weiss Announces Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp.

10/22/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The law firm of Milberg Weiss Ber=
shad Hynes & Lerach LLP announces that a class action lawsuit was filed on =
October 22, 2001, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron Corp=
. ("Enron" or the "Company") (NYSE:ENE) between January 18, 2000 and Octobe=
r 17, 2001, inclusive. A copy of the complaint filed in this action is avai=
lable from the Court, or can be viewed on Milberg Weiss' website at: http:/=
/www.milberg.com/enron/=20
The action, numbered H013630, is pending in the United States District Cour=
t for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, located at 515 Rusk=
 Street, Houston TX 77002, against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K=
. Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge pre=
siding over the case.
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)
2001-10-22 18:04 (New York)

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)

     (Adds Stilwell shares at bottom.)

     Denver, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Janus Capital Corp., whose
stock funds have lost more than a third of their value this year,
may get another jolt from Enron Corp.

     As of June 30, Denver-based Janus was the biggest
institutional holder of Enron, owning 42.8 million shares, or a
5.71 percent stake in the largest U.S. energy trading company,
according to Thomson Financial/Carson.

     Enron shares have fallen 39 percent over the past four days
on concern that the company's dealings with partnerships run by
its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses. The
Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information on
the partnerships, Enron said.

     Janus, which boosted its Enron stake in the past year in an
effort to diversify its technology-heavy stock funds, is among a
handful of firms including Putnam Investments, Alliance Capital
Management, Barclays Global Investors and Fidelity Investments
that owned more than 2 percent of the Houston-based company as of
June 30, according to Bloomberg data.

     ``It was definitely a real growth darling,'' said Christine
Benz, a senior analyst at Chicago-based fund tracker Morningstar
Inc. ``In a year like 2000, when almost nothing was working for
growth managers, Enron emerged as a story that a lot of growth
managers could like.''

                           Fund Holdings

     According to Thomson Financial, 1,187 mutual funds, or 15.4
percent of all U.S. stock funds, owned a combined 207.9 million
Enron shares as of June 30. Combined losses on the holdings amount
to $2.7 billion since Tuesday.

     According to the latest available data compiled by Thomson,
the biggest fund holders of Enron were: Janus Fund, with 2.15
percent; Janus Twenty Fund, with 1.19 percent; Alliance Premier
Growth Fund, with 1.14 percent; American Century Ultra Fund, with
1.01 percent; Janus Mercury Fund, with 0.88 percent; Vanguard 500
Index Fund, with 0.82 percent; Fidelity Magellan Fund, with 0.73
percent; AIM Value Fund, with 0.6 percent; CREF Stock Account,
with 0.58 percent; and, Putnam Investors Fund, with 0.52 percent.

     Janus Fund has lost 33.2 percent this year through Friday,
while Janus Twenty Fund has lost 33.4 percent and Janus Mercury
Fund has fallen 34 percent. A Janus spokeswoman wasn't immediately
available to comment.

     Morningstar's Benz said she suspects Janus fund managers have
already begun trimming their Enron positions.

     Enron shares had fallen 59 percent this year before last
week's news on concerns about financial reporting and money-losing
investments outside energy trading, such as trading space on
broadband telecommunications networks and building water treatment
plants.

     The stock fell $5.40, or 21 percent, to $20.65 in New York
trading today.

     ``Anecdotal evidence that I'm hearing from the fund managers
there is that they had been trimming pretty aggressively,'' said
Benz. She added that it's ``difficult to make the assertion that
they are in the clear.''

     Janus Capital is owned by Kansas City, Missouri-based
Stilwell Financial Inc., whose shares gained 73 cents today to
$22.52. Stilwell shares have fallen 43 percent this year.


Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)
2001-10-22 18:30 (New York)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)

     (Adds information on conference call in 26th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

     Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

                           Shares Plunge

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

     Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

     Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

                            Bonds Fall

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

     Enron will hold a conference call to discuss investors'
concerns at 9:30 a.m. New York time Tuesday. The call may be
accessed through the ``Investors'' section of Enron's Web site at

Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) stock plunged 20% last week after the =
energy giant revealed that a complex financing deal caused a $1.2 billion h=
it to its equity. But other big deals that have yet to receive much public =
scrutiny could further damage the company's balance sheet.=20
In the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnersh=
ips called LJM2 and LJM Cayman. An examination of the LJM2-related equity w=
ritedown can be found here.=20
However, the LJM deals make up only part of Enron's sophisticated financing=
 arrangements. Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron=
 shifted from its balance sheet. These are the $1 billion Marlin Water Trus=
t II and the $2.4 billion Osprey Trust, usually known as Whitewing.=20
The key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if th=
ey don't unwind as planned. The company may end up issuing stock to repay m=
oney borrowed through the trusts. This would dilute existing shareholders. =
Alternatively, Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on-=
balance sheet assets. But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and depr=
ive the company's profitable business lines of much-needed capital.=20
Whitewing and a Prayer?
Though set up by Enron, Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from t=
he company. Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts. The =
$3.4 billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron.=20
Both trusts are scheduled to unwind in 2003. Originally, Enron had hoped to=
 repay them by selling the trusts' underlying assets. This repayment method=
 would have had a minimal impact on Enron's balance sheet.=20
However, there's a potential problem brewing with this approach. The value =
of the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trus=
t investors. Hence Enron's two unenviable options: issuing stock, or raisin=
g cash from its own balance sheet.=20
Enron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II won't be suffi=
cient to pay it back. But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of on-ba=
lance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin I=
I. When asked if Whitewing's assets are adequate for repayment, Glisan repl=
ied: "We believe so."=20
In reference to the two trusts, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference =
call Tuesday: "We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source =
of repayments."=20
Sterling Marlin
TheStreet.com hasn't seen offering documentation for Whitewing; Enron didn'=
t provide it when requested. But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus.=
 Here's how Marlin II works. Enron took water assets, primarily based in th=
e U.K., off its balance sheet, and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them=
. Meanwhile, Marlin II issued senior debt to investors, the proceeds of whi=
ch went to Enron. The company didn't have to recognize these notes as debt =
on its balance sheet, due to the structure of the trust. Marlin II replaced=
 a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this ye=
ar.=20
Ideally, the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitabi=
lity of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell t=
hem off and pay down the trusts. To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn'=
t raise enough money, Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible p=
referred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes.=20
As it happened, the water assets didn't perform well. In fact, Enron set up=
 Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoi=
d paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock, or with cash from its=
 own balance sheet. This move risked angering the rating agencies that had =
agreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enron's pledge to backstop it=
 with preferred stock. Suddenly, it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its c=
ommitment to make good with stock.=20
Enron's Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also=
 invested in Marlin II, illustrating that investors weren't upset by the ma=
neuver.=20
Glisan says Enron almost certainly won't decide to issue stock to pay off M=
arlin II. Instead, he adds, money from pending asset sales can be used to p=
ay it off when it matures in July 2003. When asked if Enron might use the e=
xpected $1.9 billion in proceeds from selling Portland General, the utility=
 based in Portland, Ore., Glisan replied: "That's a good one."=20
But using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enron's freque=
ntly stated strategy of selling off low-yielding assets and investing the p=
roceeds in higher-yielding businesses. Portland General is almost certainly=
 a more profitable business than the U.K.'s Wessex Water, which is the domi=
nant asset in Marlin II. In addition, doing so would mean Enron couldn't us=
e all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt. Enron aims to get its debt-to-=
total-capital ratio down to 40%, from the current 50%.=20
Maturity
What about Whitewing, which matures in early 2003? Glisan lists Whitewing's=
 assets as: Central American gas distribution assets; turbines destined for=
 European power stations; interests in European power stations; and various=
 debt and equity participations in energy investments. Glisan says these as=
sets can be sold to pay off the $2.4 billion in notes issued by the trust.=
=20
But what would happen if the Whitewing assets can't fetch the necessary pri=
ce? Enron could sell off more on-balance-sheet assets. But, again, this wou=
ldn't help debt-reduction efforts, and it may be running short of large ass=
ets that it can quickly sell.=20
Whitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock. But Enron may be reluctan=
t to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs, and current s=
hareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution.=20
Investors also need to keep their eyes on the early-repayment triggers of t=
he trusts. In fact, the stock price-related element of the triggers has alr=
eady been set off. For Whitewing, the stock has to fall below $59.78; for M=
arlin II, the stock has to be under $34.13. However, something else has to =
happen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset =
sales and stock issuance. Enron's credit rating must fall below investment =
grade. That looks to be a long shot, since its rating is currently three no=
tches above subinvestment grade. But it is something the market will watch =
after Moody's said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a poss=
ible downgrade.=20
Despite all the questions stemming from the trusts, Enron still seems keen =
to use the structure. Last week, Barclays Capital was inviting investors to=
 subscribe to an Enron-related entity called the Besson Trust. This is bein=
g set up to enable Enron "to monetize substantially all of its interests in=
 EOTT Energy Partners," an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crud=
e oil. Expected proceeds from the deal are $227 million, according to the p=
rospectus. Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trus=
ts?=20
Due to off-balance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing, it's clea=
r that uncertainty could weigh on Enron's battered stock for some time.=20




Why Enron's Writedown Unnerves Some Investors
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>
Senior Columnist

Enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors, but its decision to red=
uce equity by $1.2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and conf=
usion in the market.=20
The action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner. More important, in=
vestors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enron's ba=
lance sheet, profits and earnings guidance.=20
Enron didn't provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction=
.=20
Enron doesn't include a balance sheet in its earnings release, so the equit=
y decrease couldn't be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday. And even though=
 Enron did break out $1 billion in earnings charges in its release, the com=
pany didn't feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in =
the text.=20
Instead, the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call. CEO =
Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a s=
o-called "structured finance arrangement." The Wall Street Journal later re=
ported that Enron's counter-party in this transaction was an investment par=
tnership called LJM2 Co-Investment, which has set up and run by Enron's fin=
ance chief, Andrew Fastow.=20
This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move: "In connec=
tion with the early termination, shareholders' equity will be reduced appro=
ximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding significant reduction in the nu=
mber of diluted shares outstanding." According to The Journal, Lay then sai=
d Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares.=
=20
Enron's supporters count Lay's mention of a reduction in the share count as=
 bullish, because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future.=
=20
But there are two possible problems with this theory.=20
First, Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to mak=
e $2.15 per share in operating earnings next year. Critically, the company =
did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the =
55 million shares or not. If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the =
55 million shares, the company should have upped its 2002 per-share earning=
s forecast by around 6%, since that's the amount by which the share count w=
ill be reduced. Enron needs to say what share count it's using in its guida=
nce.=20
Second, it's almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever re=
corded, casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay's assertion that the share=
 count will come down.=20
Why question the CEO? Well, in its 2000 annual report, Enron included some =
disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2. It reads: "At Dece=
mber 31, 2000, Enron had derivative instruments...on 54.8 million shares of=
 Enron common stock." The derivative instruments appear to be types of opti=
ons, or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stoc=
k at agreed prices.=20
But these derivatives-linked shares don't show up where they should in the =
annual report: in the table that breaks out the difference between the basi=
c and diluted share counts. The line item in this table that shows options-=
related shares totals only 43 million shares, which is close to the amount =
of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion. Therefore, that numbe=
r almost certainly doesn't include the 55 million LJM2-related shares. The =
fact is, at least some of the 55 million derivatives-linked shares should b=
e included if the derivatives were like normal options. That's because the =
LJM2 derivatives appear to have been "in the money", or profitable for the =
holders. Typically, all in-the-money options-based stock has to be included=
 in the diluted share count. And these LJM2 derivatives did appear to have =
that status at the end of 2000. Back then, Enron stock was trading around $=
80, way above the average $68 level at which these derivatives made money f=
or LJM2.=20
Maybe these weren't simple options and had other conditions attached that e=
xcluded them from the diluted share count. That's what disclosure elsewhere=
 in the annual report appears to imply. Alternatively, the options were emb=
edded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure, though =
it's hard think where.=20
Presumably, investors will get a full explanation in Enron's quarterly fina=
ncial results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, due by th=
e middle of November.

Greg,

ACTION - PLEASE CALL TODD REID AT DUKE

BACKGROUND:
Below is the situation with Duke and subs:
						Exposure	Line		Cash		L/C	
Duke Energy Marketing LP / ECC		($43mm)	$10mm		$52.35mm	$20.5mm
Duke Energy Trading & Marketing / ENA		($56mm)	$5mm		$61mm
Duke Energy Trading & Marketing / EPMI		($260mm)	$20mm		$171mm	$100mm

The expiration of the letters of credit are 11/30/01.  Duke believes that since these L/C's have less than 20 days to expiry their value should be zero and are asking for additional cash collateral.  Our view of the contract is that these L/C's are good collateral until expiry and should be counted in our outgoing collateral.

The roll of the letter of credit has been delayed as Haedicke/Mintz get comfortable with the reps under the L/C facility.

Duke credit guys are saying that Todd Reid has not received a return call from you and this holding up a resolution.

Bill and Louise

USA: UPDATE 1-Fitch cuts ratings on Enron debt.

11/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Fitch on Monday cut its ratings on the debt of embattled energy trader Enron Corp. and warned that it may cut the ratings again if the company does not reduce its debts, if its trading business deteriorates or if charges exceed present estimates. 
"Today's rating action reflects the difficulties Enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence," Fitch said.
Fitch cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to "BBB-minus," one notch above junk, from "BBB-plus," its subordinated debt to "BB" from "BBB," and its commercial paper to "F3" from "F2." The rating agency also downgraded Enron's preferred stock to "B-plus" from "BBB-minus." 
Fitch said reducing debt and exiting problem businesses are a management priority, and if Enron is successful, the company's credit profile will improve. "However, the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk, particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging-market countries," Fitch said. 
Fitch's cut follows downgrades last week by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Enron's shares have lost more than 65 percent in less than a month amid concerns about financial practices that triggered an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
S&P last Thursday cut Enron's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to "BBB," two notches above junk status, from "BBB-plus." Moody's Investors Service last Monday cut Enron's senior unsecured debt to "Baa2," two notches above junk, from "Baa1." 
Downgrades could make it tougher for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral. 
Enron lined up $1 billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence, according to investment bankers. 
In its third-quarter results report last month, Enron said it expected over a billion dollars of write-offs related to soured investments. It also announced an extra $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to investments that were not recorded on its balance sheet. 
Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in 2006, bid at about 80 cents on the dollar a week ago, were bid at 73 cents on the dollar on Monday, a strategist said. 
Enron shares were up 40 cents, or 3.55 percent, at $11.67 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have been in free-fall for two weeks.

Fitch Downgrades Enron To `BBB-'; Maintains Rtg Watch Negative

11/05/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 5, 2001--Fitch downgrades Enron's outstanding securities as follows: senior unsecured debt to `BBB-' from `BBB+'; subordinated debt to `BB` from `BBB'; and preferred stock to `B+' from `BBB-`. Enron's commercial paper has been downgraded to `F3' from `F2'. The senior unsecured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries, Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., are lowered to `BBB-' from `A-`. All the above securities remain on Rating Watch Negative status. Fitch would consider further downgrades if Enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt, if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration, or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non- core businesses and investments exceed present estimations. 
Today's rating action reflects the difficulties Enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence. This follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments, which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off-balance sheet vehicles. Enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment, ultimately recognizing the values of the company's core businesses.
In October, Enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper, leaving it approximately $1 billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities. In addition, the company is in the process of executing a new $1 billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of Northern Natural and Transwestern. Unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage. While its current cash position appears adequate, securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development. 
A management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses. Clearly, these actions, if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company's credit profile. However, the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk, particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries. An additional uncertainty is the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) investigation of certain Enron sponsored partnerships. The outcome and potential impact of the SEC activity is difficult to predict. 
The largest announced transaction is the sale of Portland General Electric Co.(PGE) to Northwest Natural Gas Co. The sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests. However, the transaction is not expected to close for another year. 
Enron's core businesses have continued to generate strong, predictable performance and have significant value. Prospectively, operations at Enron's domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at Enron. Also, PGE is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year. Combined, the pipelines and PGE generate nearly 25% of EBITDA. Wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns. Specifically, commodity marketing and trading activities, which comprise the most profitable and largest part of wholesale operations, have generated steady volume growth and stable unit margins. However, if Enron were unable to maintain the support of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility, these businesses would be harmed.

Enron Sr. Unsecured Debt Cut To Triple-B-Minus By Fitch

11/05/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Fitch downgraded Enron Corp.'s (ENE) senior unsecured debt ratings Monday to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus, putting the Houston energy and trading giant's credit rating just one notch above noninvestment-grade or junk status. 
In its action, the rating agency was more aggressive than Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, both of which lowered Enron's long-term corporate credit ratings one notch last week to Baa2 and triple-B, respectively.
Fitch said its rating action Monday reflects the difficulties Enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence. This follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments, which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off-balance sheet vehicles, the rating agency said. 
Enron, though, should be able to manage through this challenging environment, ultimately recognizing the values of the company's core businesses, Fitch said. 
In other rating actions, Fitch lowered Enron's subordinated debt to double-B from triple-B, while Enron's preferred stock was lowered to single-B-plus from triple-B-minus. Fitch cut Enron's commercial paper to F3 from F2. 
Fitch also took action on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Enron's pipeline subsidiaries. The ratings of those units, Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., were lowered to triple-B-minus from single-A-minus. The assets of Northern Natural and Transwestern were pledged last week to help Enron secure a new $1 billion secured bank facility. 
The rating agency said all of the ratings remain on "Rating Watch Negative" status. 
Fitch said it would consider further downgrades if Enron was unable to make progress in reducing debt, if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration, or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non-core businesses and investments exceed present estimations. 
A management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses. Clearly, these actions, if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company's credit profile, Fitch said. 
However, the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk, particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries, the rating agency said. 
An additional uncertainty is the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of certain Enron-sponsored partnerships. The outcome and potential impact of the SEC activity is difficult to predict, Fitch said.

USA: U.S. stocks seen higher at open on rate cut optimism.
By Chelsea Emery

11/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Stocks are seen climbing at the open of trading on Monday, as Wall Street looks for another half-point interest-rate cut on Tuesday to help put the lagging economy back on track and boost slumping corporate profits. 
Equities are getting an additional boost from the Treasury's decision last week to stop selling 30-year bonds, sending cash flowing out of bonds and into stocks, traders said.
The gain in futures is "the half-point talking," said Brian Finnerty, co-head of capital markets at C.E. Unterberg Towbin. "The cut continues the aggressive moves on the part of the Fed, and it comes on top of a huge move by the Treasury. The Treasury did more in one fell swoop last week than the Fed's done all year. " 
Technology stocks rose in early trading, as investors geared up for Cisco Systems Inc.'s quarterly results after exchanges close. Analysts said the networking gear maker is likely to signal lagging sales are near a turnaround. 
December futures for the Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 8 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,097.50, while December futures for the Nasdaq composite index rose 21 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,454.50. The Indicative Dow Jones index, which represents a basket of Dow stocks trading in Europe, slipped 2.4 points, or 0.02 percent. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for a 10th time this year at its meeting on Tuesday, to help jump-start the lagging economy. Lower interest rates cut borrowing costs and can spur business development. 
Blue chips rallied on Friday, helping the broader market eke out gains, as investors shrugged off a report of the biggest U.S. job losses in more than two decades in October to bet on an economic recovery next year. 
"Any kind of bad news hasn't been able to hold the market down," said Bob Basel, a listed trader with Salomon Smith Barney. 
Cisco rose to $17.80 on electronic trading system Instinet, up from its close of $17.26. The company, which makes networking gear that helps power the Internet, is expected to report fiscal first-quarter results after exchanges close. Cisco is likely to signal sales are near a rebound, indicating the lagging tech industry has reached its low point and will begin to rebound soon, analysts and investors said. 
Microsoft Corp. rose to $61.74 from its Friday close of $61.40. Microsoft and the Justice Department reached a settlement agreement last week. Still, state antitrust enforcers have found what they say are serious flaws in the settlement, and the two sides may not be able to sign the deal in its current form, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. The European Union said on Monday its probe of Microsoft continues despite the settlement. 
Enron Corp., the struggling energy giant, rose to $11.80 on Instinet, up from its close of $11.27 on Friday. Royal Dutch/Shell Group may mount an $11 billion bid for Enron, the UK's Independent paper reported on Sunday. 
Enron lined up $1 billion of new credit last week, but it still suffered a second credit rating cut amid concerns about questionable financial transactions that have triggered an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Pixar Animation Studios Inc. jumped to $37.25 from a Friday close of $36.70. Pixar and Walt Disney Co. scored a monstrous opening with their latest family cartoon "Monsters, Inc.," scaring up $63.5 million in ticket sales in its first three days, according to studio estimates issued on Sunday. 
Baxter International Inc. fell to $47.60 on Instinet from its close of $49 after it said preliminary tests show a processing fluid used in its manufacturing operations in Sweden may have played a role in kidney patient deaths linked to dialysis machines. 
Baxter said it plans to permanently discontinue making the product and warned it will take a fourth-quarter charge to cover costs related to the product cancellation. 
European markets gained on Monday, led by technology and auto stocks. Solid Wall Street futures and the prospect of more interest rate cuts later this week buoyed sentiment, traders said. Wall Street's resiliency on Friday, when investors looked beyond poor payrolls numbers and bet on a recovery next year, also helped steady European nerves. 
The FTSE Eurotop 300 index was up 1.5 percent and the Euro Stoxx 50 index rose 1.8 percent. Technology and auto stocks were the strongest as players funneled cash back into sectors which fell hard after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. 
Tokyo stocks inched higher in extremely thin trade on Monday after gains in Sony Corp and other select blue-chip stocks buoyed a market still wary of dwindling earnings and a bleak outlook for the U.S. economy. 
The benchmark Nikkei average climbed 0.61 percent or 63.76 points to 10,447.54, landing in positive turf for the second straight session.

UK: British power trading slow, prompt lifted early.

11/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - British electricity trading was slow on Monday, with traders saying prompt prices were ending broadly unchanged after a higher start in part because of a band of colder weather affecting much of the country. 
"It's a fairly quiet market, still lacking liquidity," said one trader, referring to the reluctance of some companies to deal with Enron .
In the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commision is investigating substantial losses at Enron relating to a private equity operation run by the group's former chief financial officer. 
Traders said the prompt market opened strong with day-ahead baseload lifted at 20 pounds a megawatt hour. 
But the early strength evaporated during the day and in late trade the contract was down to about 17 pounds. 
December baseload gained early support from day-ahead. It was finishing the day at about 18.40 pounds from a low of 18.34 pounds. 
Q101 baseload was seen as high as 19.45 pounds before it fell to 19.30/19.35 pounds in the afternoon. 
Summer 02 baseload was a touch stronger at 17.25 pounds while winter 02 was assessed at 19.25 pounds.

Hi again.

I understand from Randy (Jason) that the CAD $5MM is scheduled to come
tomorrow, not today as previously informed.

Enron Canada Corp has been halted from BUYing and will remain halted until
such time NGX has received additional Collateral (at least another CAD$8.5MM
plus more if Enron Canada Corp wishes to continue to purchase).

Thanks.
Kenny

prepay for all its purchases including all forward positions ever since
Enron was downgraded to BBB minus.  Unfortunately for Enron Canada Corp., I
cannot convince my Board nor my Bank to do otherwise.

Enron will still get interest from pre-payments that have not been used to
pay for gas that has already been delivered and invoiced.

With the above in mind, here is the current status:
					CAD$
$ carried forward from yesterday 	   2,725,000
Today's purchases			(14,225,000)	large part of which is Dec gas
Today's wire				   8,000,000 	which incidentally has not arrived as yet
Balance	(short)			  (3,500,000)

Jason, kindly
*	please followup with your Treasury area to see where CAD$8mm is?
*	please, for today's value date, arrange to send another CAD$3.5mm plus
whatever $$ your traders need for tomorrow?
*	your Calgary traders have another 30TJs of room for day gas at time of
writing this email (purchases so far today 3,660TJs).  Once the 30TJs is
filled, you will be halted.

We thank you for your co-operation.

Overview

Our bankruptcy filing requires a cultural change in the cash management pro=
cedures of Enron.  Because of our fiduciary obligation to our creditors, we=
 now must move to centralized cash management.  These new procedures will a=
mend our prior policy.  As management of the "Debtor", we should approach e=
ach decision about our business, including cash receipts and disbursements,=
 from the perspective of, "Does this enhance the value of the Debtor's esta=
te?"  This memo addresses the new policies that are to be immediately imple=
mented both for entities in the Chapter 11 reorganization and entities that=
 have not filed.  There will be a meeting Wednesday, December 5, 2001 at 2:=
00 PM in the Board Room on the 50th floor to discuss the new policies. =20

As a debtor-in-possession ("DIP"), we have new cash flow reporting obligati=
ons and we must develop and adhere to a cash flow budget.  Failure to adher=
e could have serious consequences to our DIP financing availability as well=
 as diminish our credibility with the creditors with whom we must negotiate=
 our ultimate exit from Chapter 11 as a reorganized entity.

All Enron business units (not just the ones in bankruptcy) will need to con=
form to these new requirements because additional entities are likely to be=
 included in the bankruptcy filing, and because it is extremely important f=
or Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirement=
s for the Company. =20

There are special procedures outlined at the end of the memo specifically r=
elating to the business units in bankruptcy (the Debtor business units).

New Processes and Procedures

Until further notice, a newly formed committee, the Cash Flow Management Co=
mmittee (the "Committee"), will meet daily to review and approve daily paym=
ents and 5-day projections for each business unit.  The Committee will be h=
eaded by George Wasaff and will also consist of Ray Bowen, Dave Gorte, Tim =
DeSpain, Bob Butts, Julia Murray and Lisa Mellencamp.  The Committee will b=
e assisted by our financial advisor, Batchelder & Partners and our outside =
counsel, Weil, Gotshal & Manges.  The Committee will review payments only a=
fter approval by the business units.  Business units remain responsible for=
 their own internal approval processes.

George Wasaff will be the Company's "Cash Czar".  His responsibilities will=
 include (i) a review of weekly cash budgets from all business units, (ii) =
presentation of weekly budgets to the Committee for approval, (iii) a revie=
w of daily disbursements for the current and immediately succeeding days an=
d (iv) comparison of actual to budget variances for cash receipts and disbu=
rsements. =20

As outlined in Rick Causey's memo of December 4, 2001, all business units m=
ust provide weekly cash flow projections.  Each week's submission should be=
 accompanied by a sufficiently detailed explanation of any variances betwee=
n budget and actual cash receipts and disbursements for the preceding week.=
 Further details of the exact requirements and format of these projections =
will be provided at the meeting.

All divisions must also provide rolling 5-day cash flow projections through=
 the intranet system by 9:00 am each day.  These 5-day projections must inc=
lude a projection of all cash receipts and disbursements for the subsequent=
 5 business days.  Copies of all supporting documentation should be sent to=
 George Wasaff, Mary Perkins, and Tim DeSpain.  Each business unit will be =
responsible for pre-screening weekly budgets and eliminating any non-essent=
ial payments.  This projection should agree to weekly cash flow projections=
 provided on each Friday for the ensuing calendar week with variances clear=
ly identified.  By working with 5-day rolling projections, we can eliminate=
 the last minute scramble to assure that  the payment is consistent with ou=
r situation.

In order to be eligible for payment, items must appear on the weekly and da=
ily cash flow projections.  Failure to include on both will result in non-p=
ayment.  Since our payments are subject to heightened scrutiny, our general=
 rule is that the practice of same day and manual wires will be discontinue=
d.  In addition, please flag any payments made to related parties as these =
may require separate reporting to the Court.  Any questions on this process=
 should be routed to George Wasaff.

Special Procedures for Debtors (Companies in bankruptcy)

See the attached Exhibit A for a list of the current Debtor Companies.  Add=
itional companies may be added with each having its own petition date.  As =
a general rule, we are legally prohibited from paying any pre-petition liab=
ilities.

The standard for what constitutes pre-petition is:
?=09Were goods delivered to Enron prior to December 2, 2001 (or specific pe=
tition date for entities filing after Dec. 2)?
?=09Were services provided prior to the petition date?
?=09If requests for payment are not clear, the business unit must contact v=
endors and request them to provide an invoice, signed by an officer, statin=
g what portion of the goods or services were delivered pre-petition.
?=09If you are unsure or have any questions, please contact George Wasaff.

You must segregate any pre-petition claims for payment.  In virtually all c=
ases these claims will not appear on the cash disbursement list because we =
are generally prohibited from making payment.  However, the Company does ha=
ve very limited authority to make payment to pre-petition vendors deemed to=
 be "critical".  In order for a pre-petition disbursement to be approved, s=
uch disbursement must:  (1) make sound business and operational sense; (2) =
be mission critical; and (3) there must not be a substitute vendor.  The bu=
siness unit heads will be responsible for ensuring that recommendations to =
the Committee for any disbursements to critical pre-petition vendors meet t=
his test.  The Committee's presumption will be that a vendor is not critica=
l.  If you believe that a pre-petition claim clearly meets the "critical" t=
est, you may submit it as a clearly flagged item, stating your reasons for =
requested payment.  The Committee and corporate management will consider th=
ese recommendations by the business unit.

Internal Controls

We need to reassess internal controls and determine if changes are required=
, especially in light of recent personnel changes.  All internal controls, =
new and existing, will be subject to review by Andrew Parsons.  He will be =
communicating with you regarding his assessment and requirements for any ch=
anges to be made.

I look forward to seeing you this afternoon at the meeting.=20

Here is my first cut at taking the existing budget numbers to a desk-level.  Here are the key assumptions behind my cost allocations:
Direct costs for each group went to that group.
Gas Ops was allocated to Houston gas.
Power Ops was allocated to East and West Power based on commercial headcount.
Most other costs were allocated to Gas, East Power, West Power, Canada, OOC based on commercial headcount.
There are a hundred ways you could do this exercise, I'm not saying that this is the right way, but at least I was able to break the costs down.

I then calculated an EBIT by desk, funded a bonus pool, paid bonuses to all the non-commercial people, and figured out what a bonus pool would look like by desk based on the proforma values.  I am not necessarily saying that this is the way that we should do it, but I think that it is one way to view the world upon which we can make whatever changes/adjustments we deem necessary.  Here are my initial conclusions / reactions:
The proforma produces bonuses for commercial employees equal to roughly 6% of their gross margin.
This number is high relative to the 1-2% we are used to, but considerably lower than the 8% to 12% that appears to be available in the market.
Our costs are way too high.  For every dollar of direct commercial expenses there are four dollars of allocations.  That just seems way out of hand.
This model sells with lower costs.  With current costs, I have a hard time convincing people in Portland that this looks good relative to people's alternatives.

I think that we need to have a lot of discussions next week on how this new organization would be managed.  I don't see why we couldn't debate, if not nail down, a bunch of things next week.  For example:
How do we allocate VAR to the best performing traders and the market that offers the best opportunity at the time?
Do we need to incent desk heads based on netco earnings while compensate traders based on desk earnings?
How will we carve up the bonus pool?  What are our choices?  What gets the VAR to the right places and properly incents teamwork?
How do we best manage costs?  How do we send appropriate cost signals for sunk costs?  For variable costs?
We need a very strong, professional, operations manager who is steeped in cost accounting, efficiency, quality control, and leadership.  There is a science to operations management that I haven't seen applied at Enron.  For example, what does it cost us to schedule a MW - average and marginal?  What does it cost us to run a book?  What does it cost us to settle transactions?
What package are we going to be able to offer to incent people to stay?  When can we start talking about it?  Who should we discuss this with?
What does our management team look like?  Is it three people?  Five people? Ten people?

I want to make this thing work.  My clear first choice for 2002 is to be on this team.  I want to be as contructive and helpful as possible in achieving this end.  I can't commit unequivically (sp?) until we sort out all of the numbers, I feel like I can sell this to the Portland team, and I know what comp looks like for me and the key people in Portland.  I feel like some adjustments to the proforma and a clear understanding of 2002 comp will probably get us there.

When do you want me in Houston (for a visit - not to move)?

Tim

Jim Steffes forwarded to Janet late Monday the recommended organization and budget($ 6.4 million total for both companies). Jim should be the primary point of contact on both the budget and Gov't Affairs organization for ENA/EES( I'll address remainder of issues with Whalley, kean, and Fallon). As an aside, it's possible the $6.4 million could be reduced somewhat as we begin to mitigate legacy real estate issues and also  consider locating the Houston-based staff in the above-referenced organization in available space with the business unit(s). Thanks.

John L. suggested I pass of this request to you.  
As you work a deal for NewCo I wanted to make sure that we include the various tools we use in structuring for pricing and evaluating deals (i.e., we want to make sure the NewCo will have the exclusive rights to this information).  Kelli has provided a basic list of this information below.  Most relates to the exotica functions (and any associated code) that Research has created for structuring deals.  I am forwarding a copy of this to Jim Meyn to see if he has any additional needs.
Thanks.

Kim mentioned that you're on the phone. Jenny designated the Disaster Recovery piece ($10M) and some other items as Capital Expenses, and we neglected to include this in our schedule. The total capital budget is $14.7M. I presume that you'll want to include this amount? 

What we currently have is expense plan of 24.9M with a 1.2 multiple equals 30.2m.

I think we'll want to amend it :

24.9M 	expense
14.7M	capital

39.6M	total (would you still want a multiple to increase to 47.5M?)

We have a call in for En Ops as well to make sure that there isn't any potential capital plan we might need to include.

Please let me know!

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

A few more details ................   Again, most of the EGA companies' ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities.  Through further research, we found a few more that don't totally fit that mold:
 
Elektro - Electricidad e Servicos S.A. in Brazil  .... 38% of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities.
EPE - Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris S/C Ltda. a.k.a. Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a 1% direct ownership interest and one Board vote.
Energia Ltd, another Brazil operation, is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp.   (Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of 22 Feb. 01.
 
Again, this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know.

Steve:
 
As stated earlier, many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership.
 
We can assure you that, for the most part, you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket (i.e., Corp., ENA, EES, etc.).  There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:
 
EA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)
                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)
 
EBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)
 
EEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.
                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  
 
EES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity
                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies
 
EGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with 
                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have
                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.
                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:
                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA
                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)
                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity
                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.
 
EIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM 
                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited
                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)
 
ENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company
 
EWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the 
                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; 
                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.
 
GLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.
 EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership
                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      
                    
Again, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.  Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance.

Ummm. Don't see an issue with expenses, although I'm sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc., Everyone I've spoken too has a domestic relo program and Citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now.

I'll see what else I can find out. Only thing I'd add to Chris's note is an agreement that he will move to Houston if we meet all "reasonable" costs.

Hi Ursula,
 
I'll ask Bob Hillier to find out who our Legato contact is.  Clearly, we need this backup software on day 1.  We will also look into the Rational relationship.  It is not as critical as it is used for development (we have licenses for Rose and for ClearCase and ClearQuest).

Hi Louise / Jay 

If you can help shed any light on your vendor relationship with Legato 
and Rational, and whether you believe there is scope for reviewing 
these licenses with a view to changing the relevant license agreements, 
that would be extremely helpful.  We understand that both these 
products would be critical components to running the Netco systems. 

Thx 
Ursula

     The two licenses are: 

     1.  Enterprise Software License Agreement between Legato 
Systems, Inc. and [E] Corp, dated as of Sept. 27, 2001, respecting 
numerous software products generally branded with the names 
NetWorker, GEMS, Celestra, Octopus and others.  Section 2.2 
provides:  "Restrictions on Use.  Licensee shall not, and shall 
not aid, abet or permit any third party to: . . . (iii) . . . use 
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use . . . 
the Software . . . for the benefit of third parties . . . ." 

     2.  Products License Agreement #3185 Modified for [E] 
Corp, issued by Ration Software Corp., dated as of Feb. 17, 1998, 
respecting various software products branded Clearcase, Rational, 
Purify, and Quantify and others.  Section 1.1 provides:  "General 
Grant of License. . . . You may not rent, lease or use the Product 
in a service bureau capacity. . . . ." 

     We continue to review the agreements for the Service 
Bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective. 
We have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring 
those to your attention as a group later. 

     If other express provisions such as the above turn up, I 
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our 
IT personnel are taking seriously.

USA: UPDATE 1-Energy casts some light in gloomy profit season.
By Per Jebsen

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. 
Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend.
FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. 
Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. 
Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. 
"The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point," said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. 
FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS 
"The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically," he said. 
Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. 
"Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down," said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. "These are good, well-financed companies." 
Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. 
The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. 
Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. 
TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE 
Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. 
Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. 
"Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks," said Burnham. "Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months." 
"Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse," he said. 
This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report. 
Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. 
Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner. 
"In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities," Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years. 
Future options for the broadband business include "sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities" he said. 
"We still think over time that it will be a valuable business," Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a "total meltdown", he added. 
Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters. 
Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations. 
Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.

USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.
By C. Bryson Hull

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. 
Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.
"What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way," Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. 
Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. 
Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. 
The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. 
"They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield," said Meade. 
Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. 
ILL-FATED BUSINESSES 
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. 
The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. 
Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. 
Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. 
Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. 
DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW 
Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. 
The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. 
All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. 
The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. 
The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. 
In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost the company $1.01 billion.

     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.

     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas
pipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman
and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news
is out.

     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''
said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight
Equity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it
doesn't mean there aren't more.''

     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the
past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO
in August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said
he left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't
confident Enron was detailing all its problems.

                         Failed Businesses

     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are
equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters.

     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New
Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.

     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit
that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as
well as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be
more specific.

     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost
another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired
workers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers.

     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its
water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron
said.

     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than
$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,
Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other
significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''
Lay said.

                         Excluding Losses

     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43
cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes
energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and
taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.
     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock
had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.

     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its
energy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who
helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

                     `Ridiculous Investments'

     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.

     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,
from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in
1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North
American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.

     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the
bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and
taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.

Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.

     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for
the best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments.''

     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money. The company
gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including
coal, forest products and steel.

     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''
Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and
clear, and that the effort is there.''

As you know, it is crucial to again put funds back into Enron Re.  Under Bermuda Law, officers, directors, etc, are criminally liable for breaches.  Thanks for getting this done.

Hi Louise, 
 
Beth has reorganized the front and back office groups enough now that I don't know all of the key individuals anymore.  But in most cases, there is someone I trust still around who knows the details about a particular system, so I've tried to identify that person and how many extra people (probably best chosen by that individual) would be needed at a minimum.  
 
I have included at the bottom a small list of "cannot lose" individuals.  In such a small organization, it would be critical, of course, to have people that can solve problems in any system.  If EnronOnline was shut down, I would also put Belmont, Guadarrama, Hillier, Jenson in the "cannot lose" group, and I would make sure that Amanullah was one of the remaining Oracle DBAs. 
 
Excluding Jenny and SAP (currently this is not in Mark's organization and I cannot find any data on it), I have listed a total of 33 people.

Louise,

I spoke to a few people today. I found that most of Research models have already been included in our migration plan. All models used by structuring groups and risk groups are already included. What I want to accomplish is to make sure we have the exhaustive list of models. The issue now is to get documentation for those models. I am not sure yet if the Exotica library has been included in the migration plan. I will keep you updated.

Thanks

Zhiyong

Louise,

IT needs source code and documentation for all Exotica library functions. In addition, we need the Excel add-in build environment for building the exotica DLL and its help functionality. We need documentation for all models used by traders and risk managers. Naveen has a list of those models. My group can help maintain those models and the exotica library and provide IT expertise. I will help get a complete list of models used. Following is the list of Exotica functions.

Thanks

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Fred- as per our conversation, can you give me the name of a UBS person who can help me set up space in one of the two NYC UBS offices.  I will handle the details.
 
Moving forward, I'd appreciate if all requests related to Enron's business in NY be directed to the Senior person (me) who has been successfully running the business here for a year and a half.
 
Regards,
Caroline

Fred, 
UBS has their main trade floor in Stamford, CT. They are actually increasing the floor (size of football field) by 50% to move more people into the space (perhaps some Texans?!). This is probably the most realistic space for us to move to as it is their Head Office in North America.

There is also an office in Midtown Manhattan on Park at 44th street. 

 I asked Bob and David hoog (Per's right-hand-men) cost of executive office space in manhattan (I think by their quick respnse time it is something that grp has also been looking into.)

They said: 
Midtown 1500 sq ft for 3/4 people with a conference rm is approx $40-60/sq ft assuming it is wired plus approx $20/sq ft for utilities. And more people now willing to negotiate short term contracts and subleases

The woman most aware of how to arrange satellite offices is Paula Corey - she was in charge of our moves within NY and I believe she  is still with Enron in Houston.

She would know real estate brokers etc. 

I honestly think that the NY situation is different from the Mexico office one as we are renting our current space from MG and by the time we may be asked to leave (end of Feb), you/we should know more abt the arrangements with UBS and where their vacancy is available for us.

Let me know if there is anything more we need to do from this end. 

Have a good day 
Robyn

You will be popular, Jonathan W seems very excited about the new position he's in.   I presume he assumes we'll all be working for him - not necessarily bad news though.

Things are very much getting back to normal here - we actually didn't work this week-end!

Where did the Chris come from - did you drop the 'tine'?

Dear Louise
Sorry I haven't got back before - can't imagine why! How I things with you - here people seem to be going thru the various stages of mourning; I think we're between anger and resignation right now. As the only ex-Dynegy person here my popularity has shot up - things were put in perspective when someone asked me if there were any good-looking blokes in Dynegy!
Answers to your much earlier questions - Jonathan & Lesley were surprised and amused when I congratulated them some while ago on their marriage - they clearly weren't & I don't think that's changed.
Jennifer got a decent package out of Powergen, went to TXU where she spent a great time skiing in Geneva with the family and then got another good payoff. She then went on to EdeF to advise them how to manage/renegotiate their long-term contracts (sound familiar?) - I think she just wanted to consult but they offered her a full time job. Got the distinct impression she's regretting accepting it as she has to commute, work in an open-plan office (where ordering curtains, beauty treatments etc is not very private business!) and deal with the French. Haven't seen her since the summer tho' and haven't seen Caroline for years. She's just waiting for the Hess sale to see whether she's wanted - timetable's slipped a bit and probably won't be completed until March or later. I will have to get back in touch as I might need some old friends.
Jonathan W. and Dave Redmond started at Dynegy Monday so inside info should be available. 
Keep in touch and keep the faith
Best Wishes
Christine

Did Jonathan and Lesley ever get married?

Marcus spoke to Caroline last week and said she wasn't very happy.  It would probably be great for Caroline to do something else.  

I have no opportunity to get to London at all as I have no dealings with anyone in London any more.  I do speak to Marcello and Matthew Scrimshaw regularly and keep up on the gossip although there frankly doesn't seem to be much.

Whatever happened to Jennifer - I was thinking about her the other day as I saw Mike Gibbons is still a Director of PowerGen.  

Are you coming over here at all - it would be great to see you over this side of the water.  David Hutchinson is coming over next month.

Louise

Hi Louise
Yes, thought I'd follow in your footsteps but a bit late in the day for me to catch up! Dynegy was no longer the place to be.
Working for Mr Crilly which is interesting - Andy & co are a great bunch of guys on the trading desk. I'm staying off the phones (too old for all that) and am doing "strategy" - will get them sorted out here in the end!
Saw Lesley and Jonathan at their house warming a couple of weeks ago - they were looking good (even Jonathan) and the house was lovely. Lesley would love to see you if you're ever over (so would I). Things might not be too good for Caroline - Hess Marketing up for sale

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=

Please advise.

Louise,
 
On reflection, when I sent you my HR team list yesterday, I made decision in order to get within 9, I would cover Portland and Calgary HR from Houston. Before we proceed on the basis of that team I need Chris and Tim to agree they are ok with this. Milnthorp says he's happy, so long as estate or our new parent provides payroll and benefits services (which I believe they will).
 
I would be happy to keep Julie Kearney on my list but I really don't know if I can drop one of the others which would obviously push my team to 10 overall (this is down from 14 or 15, depending on which list you look at)..

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron stock sustains further heavy losses.

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(New first paragraph, adds additional analyst comment) 
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock sustained further heavy losses on Friday as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite was rocked by reports about the company's relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer. 
The energy giant's stock closed down $2.95 or 10.2 percent at $26.05 per share, making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in over four years. 
Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 
"I don't think this thing passes the smell test," said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I think the CFO should be out of there right now. In the interest of the stockholders, that CFO should be gone," he said. 
Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. 
POOR JUDGMENT? 
Analysts said that at the very least, the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron, which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August. 
"For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors," said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. "It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron," he said. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year, when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. 
The stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. 
This year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured, Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO, and the company's Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payments dispute. 
Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non-core businesses, including broadband and water services. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings. 
Analysts said Enron's credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead. 
"What don't we know that went on at that company? Where's the credibility?" asked one frustrated analyst. "We don't know if it's limited to this," he said.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A Beating
By Michael Rieke

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) hype and skyrocketing share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business.
Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom. 
The company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the third quarter of last year, the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 million. 
Enron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included severance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs, loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enron's content services. 
At an analysts meeting Oct. 16, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is "not that robust" right now. Industry revenue is low and there's substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market, "more than even we anticipated," Lay said. 
The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners. 
"A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into," he said. "Others thought so, too." 
Looking back, Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital, Lay said. It spent "too much too soon." 
An Ominous Comparison 

He compared Enron's move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won't be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron. 
Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadband in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-lasting headache than broadband. 
Maybe Enron's surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers. 
It's trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year, he said. It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business. 
Meanwhile, the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in, he said. 
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs. 
At one time, they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard, Whalley said. Now they "wouldn't want to forever be in the network business." 
Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets. 
The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation. "Intermediation" is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses, said an Enron spokeswoman. It's a combination of trading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers. 
More Bad News Expected 

Rebecca Followill, a research analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter. 
"If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen, you've got to figure that their assets' values have fallen similarly," Followill told Bandwidth Beat. "I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in broadband." 
Another analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron. "To the extent that they can take more writedowns, I think it would make eminently good sense to do it." 
He predicted "a $200 million haircut" in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue. 
And that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broadband property, plant and equipment at the end of last year, he said. They had another $600 million of risk management asset receivables, inventories and working capital items. 
Followill doesn't see much future in broadband for Enron. 
"I think the business will shrink to the point where it won't be shown as a key sector in their reporting," she said. 
Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds, she said. Her investor clients don't expect broadband to contribute to Enron's earnings within the next three years. 
She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy. 
The other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. "It doesn't look like there's any right now, to be honest," he said. "They'll carry the trading operation to some degree."

Dynegy Chief: Bandwidth Growth Won't Wait For Trading
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth sector has reached its bottom and is recovering. 
But those critics don't understand his bandwidth business, Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don't understand how the business world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said.
In announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday, Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event, be it of natural or human origin. That's what's driving the recovery, he said. 
Also, businesses will avoid travel, he said, relying instead on video conferencing. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn't seen any signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering, in part, because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with, he said. 
"They're trying to find trading partners for broadband," Watson said. "That's going to be tough to do." Dynegy isn't concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isn't "a realistic model" for it yet, he said. "I said two years ago it was at least two years away. I still think it's probably at least two years away, before we actually call it a trading commodity." 
The metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks, which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity, Watson said. 
It's unfortunate that Enron's model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market, Watson said. Dynegy's model includes telecom contracts, negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply of bandwidth. 
Dynegy's bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past several months, they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy's customers. The goal has been to build a customer base. "We're looking at being an intermediary, and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today." 
Since Dynegy lit its 16,000 route-mile network two weeks ago, the trading desk has been trying to fill the company's network instead of buying bandwidth from others. "I'm trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements," Watson said. 
He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. "They have offices that never talked to each before," he said. "Now they've got to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable." 
ChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy, said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids. 
The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications, the corporation's telecommunications unit, is $20 million to $25 million a quarter, Watson said. In the third quarter, it lost $15 million, down from $20 million in the second quarter. 
Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. 
"If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that's what we need really," he said. "If we can get there by the end of next year, I'll be very happy. I think by '03, this market will have righted itself." 
Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy. 
"Dynegy is an energy company," he said. "Our energy merchant company is doing very well and business is growing like a weed...(Telecommunications) is not our core business by any stretch right now. But I'd love to be able to tell you it's going to be. I'd love to be able to tell you it is someday."

UK: Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out.
By Amanda Cooper

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchange members' profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts. 
The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of high-profile companies to withdraw from the market, casting a pall over next week's yearly LME Week industry gathering in London.
Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks, raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work. 
"Good people can always be placed. As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire," Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment group Exchange Consulting said. 
"Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets, people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies." 
Last week, ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member, unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor, prompting around 25 job losses among traders, phone jockeys and clerks. 
Then blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New York base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact, but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process. 
In the same week, the LME's largest floor trader, Enron Metals, said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group . 
SECURITY 
With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time, competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security. 
"What we're finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record, which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they're keen to stay put," Gilley said. 
"So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years, they are now staying for three to five years. 
"They probably feel that they're reasonably safe where they are, they're well recognised and not going to stick their necks out," she said. 
BONUS FEARS 
October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences 
Also, traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bonuses, which are usually announced at the end of the year. 
"Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of year, people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don't think any of them are anticipating good bonuses. They're probably just happy to have a job," Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said. 
LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi-tech and telecomms stocks. 
Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients, and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market. 
Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal. 
"A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it, " Gilley said. 
"The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing," she added. 
As for morale in the industry, individuals' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed. 
"Just because I've lost my job doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Porsche," one trader said.

New Power Hldg Sees Meeting 3Q Loss Estimate

10/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Holding Inc. (NPW) expects to meet its prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement with Enron Corp. (ENE), lowering the collateral New Power must post under a master netting agreement. 
In a press release Friday, New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact and cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.
The company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. 
Analysts put the company's third quarter loss at $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Third quarter revenue will be "slightly lower" than the $60 million to $65 million forecast in August, New Power said. 

In the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.19 million. 
The amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the master cross-product netting, setoff, and security agreement, and expands through Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the Enron units. 
Under the amended pact, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. 
Shares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67, up 1 cent, or 0.6%, on early composite volume of 7,900 shares. Average daily volume is 223,800 shares.

David, aware of these regulations and hence that is why we have the established channels of approval - in this instance there is obviously need for more caution. However this has now been on the radar screen for some time and when we think issue resolved it is seemingly not - hence we need to address asap.

Jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue. Under Australian Law the Directors of ECAPPL need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid. Failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt. If the Coal Group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments   then that is the obvious way forward. One of the Coal Group in the Sydney office (presumably Paul McPhee) could replace Heidi Mason as resident director.

We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

I do not know his title, but Vivian Mase (sp?) referred us to him last night as a senior commercial person.  We did not go over document last night,  just concept level of issue.  If it works as you want in the current version, just confirm with John that he will accept it.

There is an open issue with respect to how the URL address will be positioned between the estate and NETCO.  It was my understanding that we wanted it retained at the estate with a pointer to NETCO, and a window box back to EOL.  Please call John Casaucoumeq (with whom I understand you will be speaking tomorrow at some time) (212 723 9661) and determine with him how this is to work.  Citi lawyer said however you and he work it out will be satisfactory as it is a business issue.  Please let Anne and I know.  Thanks.  Mary

A couple of comments on the revised form of Assignment and License

1.  This appears to allow the Estate to use the Software (including the EnronOnline Software) and the processes and services covered by the patents for trading gas and power within North America.  Is this the new deal?  For the template and the Wind deal?  Also, does 3.1 (b) allow Enron to sell the processes covered by the patents without any restriction on field of use?

2.  Are we now going to give Enron the right to sublicense and distribute Source Code?  I thought we were going to limit it to Object Code.

3.  In Section 3.1 do we need to define affiliates?

4.  Are the restrictions on Asssignment and Licensing in Section 4.4 supposed cover all the Software, including the mid and back office functions, or only the EOL Software?

Here is the revised draft reflecting comments from Enron management team
and Enron legal team (Houston).

For some reason, I am unable to run Comparite remotely.  If someone located
in NYO could run a comparison between Version 3 and Version 6 and
distribute to this same list it will aid people in the review.  Thanks.

Louise --

Mark mentioned you had called regarding EnronOnline comments.  Here is the currently approved EnronOnline statement:


For the past two years, Enron has used 30-day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day-to-day basis.  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we provided some daily information.  However, we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward.  While we saw some decrease in volumes on EnronOnline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement, volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of more than 5,700 transactions with a notional value exceeding $2.7 billion.


Does this meet with your approval?  In light of the merger, we are getting away from the daily regurgitation of numbers and back to our former policy.

Eric

Fimat accepted the Enron Corp guarantee so our trading line with then will be increased tomorrow (to approximately $15-16 million from $11 million.)  Fimat will have our trading line up to $20 million as soon as they complete their internal credit process. 

The Soc Gen money is priced as follows:

Original margin:  LIBOR
Variation margin: LIBOR + 5 bp 

Warren will call John directly when the line is increased.  

Thanks to everyone for all their help.

"Reasonable" works for me - my interpretation is what Enron has done in the past (and many other companies do) including but not limited to the following:

- actual moving and related costs 
- sales commission on house
- a couple of moving trips
- temp housing for a month or two
- coverage on appraised value of house if can not sell quickly
- gross up to cover taxes, where appropriate

- Not looking to gain, just to remain whole

Ummm. Don't see an issue with expenses, although I'm sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc., Everyone I've spoken too has a domestic relo program and Citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now.

I'll see what else I can find out. Only thing I'd add to Chris's note is an agreement that he will move to Houston if we meet all "reasonable" costs.

Mahonia transaction is one way margin only because mahonia has already prepaid their leg of the transaction so there is never a scenario where the floating leg would be less than the fixed leg (which has been bought down to 0) so margining is not possible in that direction. As prices fall we effectively begin to repay the transaction. We can followup in more detail later on the structure but we will also work on mitigating the margin req due to falling prices as the pipe deal closes and resources can be redeployed.

One more.

- Washington Gas: EES has parental guaranty. Due to current financial status, Washington Gas has requested Bond instead. RAC contact indicated no bond available - EES has 30 days to respond.

A note on the Con-Ed - Services/Operations has a work around for the few Mid-market deals origination is closing which will prevent us from increasing our security (Straight Dual Billing). Mass Market volume increase will drive any security increase in this market.

Thanks,
Rebecca

... and just to be clear, here are the recent or current issues I am aware of and their status:

Con Ed, request for $1 million security in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  $1 million sent prior to 11/14 deadline.  Request for additional security likely to come when Con Ed sees our increasing load.
SoCal Gas, request for margin sharing agreement in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  New contract signed and delivered 11/16.  Retail and wholesale gas desks to work together to avoid occurence of margin call for credit over $5 million daily.
Peoples Gas of IL, request for letter of credit for $40k in lieu of parental guaranty:  deferred.  Peoples agreed to suspend demand for l/c if further downgrade does not occur.
Virginia license for EES gas:  complete, for now.  Services served copy of application to other parties.  Their comments due back to VA SCC by Dec 7.
Maryland license for EEMC gas:  scheduled to be approved on provisional basis today.  MD PSC will be reviewing generic requirement that parental guarantees be unconditional, unlimited, and unrestricted.
Pennsylvania, request for update to EES and EPMI bonds and request for increase in EES bond from $250k to $3.8m:  Under review.  New bond language has been sent to Mary Grisaffi.  Trying to whittle down (or eliminate) increase.
CG&E, request for deposit associated with Transmission Service Agreement:  being processed.  Service request reduced from 100 MW to 25 MW to reduce cash outlay.
First Energy, requested new security in lieu of parental guaranty.  deferred.  First Energy agreed to continue accepting parental guaranty in absence of further downgrade.

If there are others we should know about, please let me know.

After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Talk with richter and louise together if possible. Initially newco would only get an exclusive license for gas and power and not the code but I think creditors should have options so brad is still looking at determining eol value outside of a newco deal.

certain collateral with Exchange on request.  Certain funds have been wire
transferred from our account to Exchange, and we confirm and clarify that
those funds were delivered by us as agent for Enron Canada Corp., and the
deposit of those funds is and is deemed to be a deposit by Enron Canada
Corp.

Absolutely agree with Dave.  Any services agreement should be invisible to the market and Newco should be seen as the conterparty.  The services agreement should just pertain to the time that Newco does not have the staff to service it...as short as time as possible.

Guys, the nature, term, etc of any such agreement will have to be agreed to by Jeff McMahon. I would not be supportive of any long-term services agreement without a very close examination of the economics. A term agreement, at the right price, where NewCo continues to control the business relationship and optionality may be a win-win and provide maximum benefit to the estate.

- Terri did the deal for $1.5 million gain to Enron.
- Above profit was negotiated based on $4 million up-front payment.
- For income smoothing reasons, OPPD asked to defer the payment, which we agreed to do.
- OPPD also asked to retain the option for early payment in the event their circumstances changed. We agreed to do this, but also negotiated the LIBOR discount.

i.e.: They gave us the potential time value for free, but have now exercised their option: Therefore we have only had the free time value for 5.5 months, instead of 11 (ish).

Per the broker statement received this morning the initial margin for Mann increased by only $6.1MM.  It does not appear that they have changed their margin calculation method from this.  I have contacted the Enron person responsible for confirming the amounts to be settled with Mann and instructed her to contact me if Mann requests any settlement that differs from the statement received this morning.  The preliminary number for Mann's initial margin and variation margin was a net inflow of $4.8MM.

I will let you know of any changes.  Thanks.

Non payments for ENA only.  More to follow.  We should seriously consider some default notices.

I just confirmed the cash funds were transferred this afternoon to ENA in the amount of $9 MM.  The total cash account for enovate was approximately $21 MM, with PEC 50% and ENA 50%.  Due to PEC request, we kept $3 MM in the account to cover cash sweeps required in the next few weeks.  

Just an FYI...

Todd Esay called and still wants to book out some power deals. I refered him to Ed Sacks. BUT, I want to hold off on the book outs and tell him we'll do them if they agree to a credit ring (will bring in cash) on the gas side. Bill would need to call Sempra credit to verify our total exposure. Can we talk to them about this???? Please let Bill know.   geof

NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Online energy trading
leader EnronOnline will merge with smaller rival
DynegyDirect after its parent company Enron Corp.
(NYSE:ENE - news) agreed last week to a $9 billion
takeover by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - news), Dynegy said
Monday.

The integration of the two platforms will take about
six to nine months, Dynegy said. In the meantime, the
two will continue to operate separately.

``We're looking to take the best of both platforms for
the integrated company,'' said Dynegy spokesman John
Sousa. ``(The emerging platform) will continue to be
based on a one-to-many philosophy as it stands now.''

On both EnronOnline and DynegyDirect traders can only
deal with Enron and Dynegy, respectively.

EnronOnline is the biggest online energy trading
platform in the United States, with a daily average of
$2.6 billion in trades in the past month.

DynegyDirect is a much smaller, though growing
platform. It recorded nearly $10 billion in
transactions in the third quarter.

The two platforms offer trading in hundreds of
products and services, from crude oil and refined
products, to natural gas and electricity. Most of the
trading is done in U.S. markets, but some European
markets are available as well.

Enron, currently North America's biggest buyer and
seller of both natural gas and electricity, agreed to
a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series
of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe into
the off-balance sheet dealings, a $1.2 billion cut in
shareholder equity and damaging credit rating
downgrades.

However, Dynegy can drop its offer if more bad news
emerges, or if pending lawsuits against Enron lead to
more than $3.5 billion in costs.

Dynegy also expressed confidence the takeover will win
U.S. regulatory approval and said it does not expect
any antitrust concerns to impede the merger of the two
electronic platforms.

Dynegy shares gained $5.55, or 14.3 percent, to $44.31
on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Enron
rose 61 cents, or 7 percent, to $9.24.

The takeover halted a free-fall in Enron's stock that
lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in
the past month.

One final new year's email: the netco startup plan for power is assuming 45-60 days to get a FERC license, 60-120 days to get transmission and pool agreements, etc so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer.  Presto, belden, sager, nicholai and I are meeting 9:30 wednesday to discuss.  Hillis set up a room if you would like to attend.

A couple of comments on the revised form of Assignment and License

1.  This appears to allow the Estate to use the Software (including the EnronOnline Software) and the processes and services covered by the patents for trading gas and power within North America.  Is this the new deal?  For the template and the Wind deal?  Also, does 3.1 (b) allow Enron to sell the processes covered by the patents without any restriction on field of use?

2.  Are we now going to give Enron the right to sublicense and distribute Source Code?  I thought we were going to limit it to Object Code.

3.  In Section 3.1 do we need to define affiliates?

4.  Are the restrictions on Asssignment and Licensing in Section 4.4 supposed cover all the Software, including the mid and back office functions, or only the EOL Software?

For some reason, I am unable to run Comparite remotely.  If someone located
in NYO could run a comparison between Version 3 and Version 6 and

The SO2 Emissions Credits Inventory transaction with Barclays Bank PLC has been extended for 12 more months as of yesterday, November 6. Barclays has arranged a facility of $170 million, of which $158 million was used as of yesterday. As a condition of extending the term past yesterday, Barclays required collateral in the form of a cash deposit or an L/C from an acceptable bank. We have posted cash until L/C lines become available. The cash raised, net of collateral posted, was approx $98 million, with capacity to put more SO2 credits into the facility. The facility allows Enron to raise cash off-balance sheet without leaving us with short positions in our SO2 book.

As a condition of Barclays accepting cash collateral instead of an L/C, we amended the Swap Master between ENA and Barclays PLC to reduce the number of days to pay to avoid a payment default to one business day from three business days after notification by Barclays. This amendment automatically reverts back to the original three business days immediately upon Enron posting an L/C to replace the cash collateral. Further, Barclays has agreed to review the need for collateral in six months, such that if our credit situation improves sufficiently Barclays will release the collateral while leaving the facility in place.

The terms of the transaction allow EGM to sell SO2 Credits into the facility and call back the credits on one day's notice multiple times over the next year. We pay interest expense in advance as a call option premium; if we call any credits back early, however, we receive a refund on the unused interest expense. The upfront fee was 50bp on $170 mm for the year (though we really have 13 months) and the spread is 65 bp.

Please contact Soma Ghosh or me if you would like further updates.


On behalf of Soma Ghosh
and
Jim Lewis

Hi Louise;  I know things are tough in all areas and this is a difficult time for everyone. I just wanted to let you know that I don't know what my destiny will be around here especially since we are shutting Broadband down and I have not received any word if I will be part of the work out team.  If you know of anything that might be fit for me either for the short term or the longer, please keep me in mind.

Best regards & good luck,

Arshak.

there are 3 (AEP,HETCO, and Phibro).  The first number is the amount originally called for, and the second is what the call should be today based on last night's marks.  I have also attached a spreadsheet with the same data.

All numbers in millions:

AEP 		19.25	22.5
Phibro		16	16
HETCO		17.25	9.5

Thanks,

I spoke to Steffes this afternoon.  I don't know what the FERC workload looks like.  He can answer that better than me.  We will need good representation at FERC during the next 12 months due to the California refund case at a minimum.  Steffes recommended keeping Alvarez.  I'm not sure that I need him 100 percent of the time.  But I am willing to go with Jim's recommendation.

Subject:	Credit Issues

Rudwell - as you can probably imagine, we have had several counterparties with whom enovate has pending transactions that have initially claimed they will not accept Enron's credit as part of the transaction.  Below is a list of those counterparties to date:

Counterparty		Service				Term 					Total Value
Wisconsin Gas		10 day Storage Service			3 yrs (4/1/02 - 3/31/05)			$1,100,000
Wisconsin Gas		50 day Storage Service			3 yrs (4/1/02 - 3/31/05)			$3,375,000
Wisconsin Pub. Svc	5 day Storage Service			4 months (11/10/01 - 3/10/02)		$   240,000
TXU			Storage Service				1 yr (4/1/02 - 3/31/03)			$   990,000

We are also in the process of negotiating transactions with several other counterparties including Oneok, PG&E, and PanCanadian.  They have not yet raised credit concerns.  

It is obviously imperative that we keep business moving forward.  In that regard, what has our response been to such denials of credit?  Have we thought about posting L/C's or is that cost prohibitive?  We may have some flexibility with Peoples posting credit, but that has certain legal implications and is limited.  Also, three of the above deals do not start until April so we may have some flexibility with timing.  However, all of the above counterparties are anxious to put the contracting logistics behind them in case the deals fall through and they need to replace the service.

Any thoughts and assistance on this effort is greatly appreciated.

Gregg

I would suggest that based upon the conversations last night we need to advise them of the same facts re all North American offices re the trading business gas and power:  to my knowledge, NY, SF, Denver, Monterrey, Chicago.  Is Omaha only the pipes these days?  Any other offices of which anyone is aware.  Please respond with all information to Eddy Daniels.

Citi's counsel has requested a summary of our trading ops in Mexico:  when did we open the offices, how many folks did we have there, when did we close the offices, are there any liabilities remaining related to the ops., did we use the US legal entities or create new entities, etc.

Can we discuss this tomorrow morning at your convenience.

I have arranged for the meeting to take place in the large conference room here on the sixth floor - 06980.  I have confirmed that the A/V equipment is working so if you would like to use powerpoint in the conference room, it is available.  Also, if you would like to send me your presentations I will be more than happy to test run them for you or have them ready to go.  I will be here at 7:00 - 7:30 am tomorrow morning.

Sandwiches have been ordered for lunch and will be served in conference room 06984.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

The New York 780 3rd Ave office is closed and has been inventoried. I am now working on the removal of the IT equipment. The 520 Madison office is leased under MG Metals and only a few ENA employees remain at that location. Chicago, Montreal and Toronto include some MG people and I am hoping to have some clarity on these locations early in the new year.

I appreciate your assistance

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary
Portland
San Francisco
Chicago
Denver

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Tammy

I neglected to spell out that at 5:30 we hope John or Louise will walk through the details of physical delivery, so that
everyone on our due diligence team will have the opportunity to ask questions that may arise.

Team:
	
We have set up two conference calls for this afternoon, the first at 5 pm (NY time) and the second at 5:30 pm. We are
currently confirming participation from Enron - either Louise Kitchen or John Lavoratto from the Wholesale trading
business.  You are each invited to join, either at 5 or 5:30 (the same call in number will work for both) depending on
your needs.

At 5, Ernie Pittarelli (Operations) plans to review with Louise or John the scope of the business going forward. This
may be of in interest to Pat O'Donnell (IT) and Per Dyrvik (Finance) as well.

At 5:30, the topic will turn to physical delivery. I would anticipate that Lou Eber (legal) will want to participate, as
well as outside counsel from Covington & Burling and Sullivan & Cromwell. Bill Glass (credit) and Mike Stockman (risk)
may also want to participate on this call.

The dial-in number, for both 5 and 5:30, is (888) 446-5348 (domestic) and (913) 338-9600 (international).

Conference Moderator:			James Brennan

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

Sabra Dinari

I talked to Bob on Friday.  He is involved with Jay and the IT people on the system plan.

The only item open, I think, is a deal with EC Outlook concerning the EDI Hub.  Jay  and Bob
McAllif are working with them. Won't need right way, used for physical gas.

He is also working on a list of contracts needed with the pipelines and LDC's.

I'll keep you posted if I see any problems with logistics.

thanks

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary
Portland
San Francisco
Chicago
Denver

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Under commitments to PEC, Enron has commited to provide office, computers, trading systems, etc.  If this is changing, I need to know quickly.  I have been provided indications from several outside counterparties, some divisions within Newco and I thought Netco as holding interest in purchasing the Chicago business.  Due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with PEC, I believe it imperative that the business/office be operational until March, 2002, at a minimum.
 
Please advise.

Laura, 
I understand that the Metals group has asked to keep the Chicago office open until Mar 31 to wind things down.  Do you have any new information on ENA's Chicago folks at this time?  We may ask for a 60 day extension under bankruptcy orders to terminate the lease.  

Thanks, 
Tammy

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary 
Portland 
San Francisco 
Chicago 
Denver 

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards, 
Tammy

Who can I work with to get the first names of the individuals listed for Gas Trading, as well as the split between structuring/fundamentals/trading? (I see some of the latter in the name column, is that the entire group? it would be helpful to have them grouped separately.) In a lot of cases there are several listing for some names, and they appear to be IT people. We're building a plan based on title, so that's why I need this info. Thanks!

Here are revised headcount allocation numbers from what I left you( same number of people in total with better descriptions of responsibilities and more precise allocations)...also attached is outside services detail( reduced by $700,000 since our discussions earlier) with business unit allocations reflected. The overall budget based on these attachments, which would reflect the $ 700,000 outside services reduction and three additional people severed( all assistants) would come to $13,200,000. I would allocate as follows: EES:$5.9 million; Enron Americas:$6.8 million; and global assets picking up $500,000. Let's talk Monday.

How the mighty bruins have fallen.  Too bad because I thought the National Championship game was within reach.  Oh well. 

The weather desk gas gone through a fundamental transformation and has attempted to align itself with the gas and power desks.  Dave Kistler (origination) and I (mid-markets) are getting ourselves organized and we need your help.  We would like to get a West Power org chart and if possible a list of your desk's counterparties (we do not want to interfere with your relationships and weather derivatives may be an additional product to sell to your customers).  If you could help us out with this, that would be great.  Thanks and hopefully I will get out there soon to meet the people and provide a little more clarity to what we are doing and how we can add value to you.

Ted

Subject:	DIP Financing and other Cash Flows

Attached is the spreadsheet we talked about on the phone. The numbers in the sheet represent what was shown to the DIP lenders last 
weekend in order to obtain  financing. In many cases all revenues and other items were completely eliminated leaving only operating expense and 
capital expenditures. We were trying to be as conservative as possible but also show a viable entity going forward. I hope we were not to far off.

What we would like you to do is populate this format with the numbers you believe to be true going forward based on the recent changes. We also need a detailed 
explanation of what is in the numbers. A few things to remember are:

	This estimate should contain no allocations except for what you believe you salaries and wages would be post reduction (normally paid by Corp)

	Operating expenses includes salaries, outside services, benefits, employee expenses and any other items normally in operating expenses including 
		non employee expenses and taxes other than income taxes.  Please provide as much detail as possible.  There is space for detailed opex at 		the bottom of the page.Call me if you have questions.

	Although in Chapter 11 interest and income taxes are not paid, please provide these to the extent your business unit pays them. We will adjust for 
		entities that are in the filing.

	I understand there is a big global effort to identify assets for sale but please provide your best estimate to date along with the detail and we will 		compare to the global effort.

	Capex and investing should be mandatory only. Please provide detail back up.
	
	To the extent your business has any financing activities please provide. again we will adjust for filing entities.

	We need this as soon as possible but no later than Friday morning 9:00 am.

This should be a realistic view of your business unit as run under Chapter 11. We are only focused on CASH items now. Please provide backup detail for any 
item you think needs it or is not self evident. Please do not hesitate to call myself 57852 or Greg Adams 33887 with questions.

Shortly this format will be expanded to weekly for Dec'01 and 13 weeks of 2002 with monthly through the remainder of 2002. This is the attachment 
that was suppose to be attached to the email from Rick Causey. Below is a list of the CAO' s / Leads and what entities they are responsible for.

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch
2001-10-26 15:00 (New York)

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg

Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of
Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million
senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's)
approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes
are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the
placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by
Fitch.

The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund
account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The
overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated
'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service
interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies
on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred
securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan
to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.

Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron
unsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock.

While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in
each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity
date, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to
deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note
Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary
events of default under the notes. It is important to note that
Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as
appropriate.


Enron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans

10/26/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. 
Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.
Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. 
Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. 
That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. 
Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. 
Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. 
Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. 
One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Banks, the investor said, "are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02," the investor said. 
Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) 
"As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books," this person said. 
Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. 
"Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that," the fixed income official said.

Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal
By Michael Rieke
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. 
Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.
After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. 
In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. 
The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said. 

Microsoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't provide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have breached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages. 
The suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal. 
In a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's prior approval. 
An Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the release. 
A Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN 7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, access to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25. 
The Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver "state-of-the-art" video and audio through "dramatically improved" broadband technology. The new service would extend MSN broadband service "to more than 29 million households in 45 markets." 
By the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households capable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access. 
The Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit. 
Neither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. 
The Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet. 
That deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's fiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service.

ENRON UNIT TAKES HEAT POWER GROUP SAYS ENERGY FIRM FAILED BOND REQUIREMENTS
Jeffrey Krasner, Globe Staff

10/26/2001
The Boston Globe
THIRD
C.1
(Copyright 2001)

The retail sales subsidiary of Houston energy giant Enron Corp. faced expulsion last week from the New England group representing power generators, marketers and distributors. The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills. 
ISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to "initiate termination proceedings" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a letter obtained by the Globe.
An Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's requirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels. 
"It was an administrative snafu," said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Enron. "It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on time] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on Friday." 
According to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months. "Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently," said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the letter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization "has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured." 
But Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous "financial assurance" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. Therefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was the third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the current default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that resulted in the letter. "We're working with ISO New England to figure that out," she said. 
The recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's director of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman of Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization. 
"This is not that unusual within the pool," said Allegretti. "I frequently receive notices of technical defaults." As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation, he said, "We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork." 
The incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO. 
Enron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Enron lost $618 million in the third quarter. 
Yesterday, Enron's shares closed at $16.35, down 6 cents, on volume of 39.1 million shares.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell critics' concerns 
Financial Times; Oct 26, 2001
By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron has put up a page on its website of "frequently asked questions" in response to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's controversial results announcement. 
Unfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with the answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its chief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs. 
However, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle "partnerships". "It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move," says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. "It's not the end of it." 
The shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade lower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars 84.87 until the group improves its transparency. 
One of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement on October 16 concerned "a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in shareholders' equity". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news release on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up conference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in the earnings report. 
It has since been called a "loss" and a "write-off" and Enron's staff have struggled to explain it in plain language. 
Enron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles, Enron "recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These adjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods". 
The confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might hurt its debt rating. 
Mr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts. "I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions," said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer. 
Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. 
"Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them," Mr Niles says. Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso said it was facing "a lot of questions on its accounting practices".

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)

     (Adds Egan-Jones lowering credit rating in 12th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond
rating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit line
because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.

     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after
investors questioned the company's transactions with affiliated
companies run by its former chief financial officer. The stock
fell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.

     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed income
assets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who was
supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was
running partnerships for the benefit of himself.''

     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-
term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company will
use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it
has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009
declined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an
offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating
of ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.

     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that
the company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in
third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good
credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding
collateral and to settle transactions.


                         Dilution Concerns

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holding of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's Investors
Service has the company on watch for possible downgrade, and
Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to
negative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating on
Enron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.

                         Other Liabilities

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as "lead plaintiff." Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Weiss & Yourman or other counsel of your choice to serve as your counsel in this action.

Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest. 

With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  

Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.

Barry is in Accounting for now, Jim wants him for the estate.  All of that was before you were in.  I had to plan.  I think Barry is an asset - Wes and I don't know where though.  Any thoughts?

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

=09=09   Dynegy abandons Enron deal  Shares of energy trader plunge, bankru=
ptcy looms     By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com   Newswatch  More Headl=
ines        HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Dynegy Corp. on Wednesday abandoned its pla=
n to rescue Enron Corp. after Enron's credit ratings were cut to junk-bond =
status, raising the prospects of a bankruptcy filing for what was once the =
largest U.S. energy trader.  Enron shares (ENE ) closed at 61 cents, down $=
3.50, having lost as much as 85 percent of their value on the day and havin=
g collapsed from a 52-week high of almost $85 just 11 months ago. The compa=
ny lost around $2.6 billion worth of market capitalization from Tuesday to =
Wednesday.  Close to 342 million Enron shares had changed hands Wednesday b=
y the close, and the stock broke the all-time volume record of 309 million =
shares set by Intel on Sept. 22, 2000. Dynegy (DYN ) shares lost $4.92, or =
12 percent, to $35.97.  Saying in a conference call that it had to "protect=
" its shareholders, Dynegy announced it had terminated its agreement with E=
nron, citing "Enron's breaches of representations, warranties, covenants an=
d agreements in the merger agreement, including the material adverse change=
 provision."   Company-specific problems?  Dynegy Chairman and Chief Execut=
ive Chuck Watson said: "some of the best deals are the ones that don't get =
done."   "While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in diffi=
culties, this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business," =
he said.   Dynegy President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Bergstrom sai=
d that energy traders have had weeks to prepare for Enron's diminished role=
 in the business and that the industry has suffered "no degradation," as he=
 put it.  "There has been a clear flight to quality, and it's occurring as =
we speak," Bergstrom said. "Dynegydirect is a highly scalable platform."  D=
ynegydirect is a platform much like Enron's flagship EnronOnline, which it =
turned off Wednesday and which just a month ago was the largest online ener=
gy-trading platform, accounting for an average of $3 billion in trades a da=
y.  Dynegy's trading exposure to Enron is $75 million, and the company is n=
o longer trading with its embattled former merger partner and fellow Housto=
n industrial giant, Bergstrom said.  "Dynegy's customer-based, asset-backed=
 energy delivery network has been the driver of our 45 percent compounded a=
nnual growth rate for the past 16 years and will continue to provide us wit=
h earnings sustainability and future growth." Watson said.  As part of the =
deal, Dynegy had the option to keep Northern Natural Gas, Enron's highly va=
lued natural-gas pipeline, even if the agreement were terminated. The compa=
ny said during the call that it would exercise that option.  ChevronTexaco =
(CVX ) , which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, originally gave $1.5 bill=
ion to the company in the transaction. Dynegy used the money to purchase 10=
0 percent of the preferred shares of Northern Natural Gas.  Enron has 180 d=
ays from the date the merger agreement was signed, Nov. 9, to repurchase th=
e pipeline system, Watson said. Enron said in a statement that it was revie=
wing Dynegy's claim of rights to Northern.  Enron representatives did not p=
articipate in the call, and Dynegy executives said they had been advised ag=
ainst the customary practice of taking questions.  Enron said it has tempor=
arily suspended payments "other than those necessary to maintain" its core =
energy businesses and added that it is exploring options to keep those oper=
ations alive. "To do this, we will work to retain the employees necessary t=
o the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses=
," said Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay.  Enron told employees their questio=
ns would be answered in due course and they would receive their paychecks o=
n Friday.  Analysts said the next step for Enron would likely be a bankrupt=
cy filing.  "Chapter 11 is not the worst of all worlds by any means," said =
John Olson, a Houston-based energy analyst. "The key to salvaging the busin=
ess is the level of debtor-in-possession financing they can get to allow th=
em to trade in some realistic fashion."  DIP financing takes precedence ove=
r all other claims, he said.  "The equity people are now at the very bottom=
 of the barrel, and the only people lower than them are [the people who fil=
ed] the stockholder suits," Olson said.  In a note to clients, analyst Mich=
ael Heim of A.G. Edwards said that Enron, without Dynegy, has "no value."  =
"Enron ... will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly," Heim said. "Unli=
ke other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price, t=
here are no hard assets to salvage."  Ahead of this news, S&P cut Enron's r=
ating to B-minus, or junk status, from BBB-minus, which is the lowest inves=
tment-grade rating. The rating agency said that the move reflects "concerns=
 about the viability of the merger agreement with Dynegy and liquidity impl=
ications of the possible failure of that transaction. The ratings are place=
d on CreditWatch with developing implications."  Moody's made its announcem=
ent of a rating cut to B2 from Baa3 and said that Enron's debt remains unde=
r review for additional downgrade.  In its report, Moody's cited the likeli=
hood of a Dynegy-Enron breakup, fueled by Enron's declining financial perfo=
rmance, as the reason for the downgrade.  "Moody's ... Baa3 rating was pred=
icated on good prospects for completion of the merger with Dynegy and reaso=
nable prospects for marginally investment-grade characteristics of the merg=
ed entity," Moody's wrote. "Furthermore, lack of confidence in Enron by its=
 trading counterparties appears to be adversely affecting Enron's core trad=
ing operations."  For Enron to survive, the credit agency said, it's impera=
tive that the volumes from the trading business remain profitable.     Fitc=
h, which had rated Enron BBB-minus, lowered the rating to CC, which "indica=
tes that default of some kind appears probable."  The U.S. Treasury is keep=
ing an eye on the impact the Enron fallout is having on the credit markets,=
 spokeswoman Michele Davis said Wednesday.   "We are monitoring credit mark=
ets as we do every day," Davis said. "Markets always fluctuate and we haven=
't seen anything extraordinary." Treasury said that outside its surveillanc=
e of credit markets, it would refer any inquiries on energy trading to the =
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commi=
ssion.  Earlier in the day   [IMAGE]    Dynegy, which had originally offere=
d to buy Enron for $9 billion in stock, confirmed Tuesday that the two comp=
anies were discussing a new deal structure, and it said ahead of the credit=
-ratings and eventual termination news Wednesday that discussions were cont=
inuing.  "I'm not aware of any changes in any status of the merger," Dynegy=
 spokesman John Sousa said before the S&P announcement. The merger agreemen=
t contained a material adverse-affect clause that, if triggered, allowed Dy=
negy to walk away from the deal.  The decline in Enron's stock price and in=
formation contained in the company's 10-Q filing of Nov. 19 could had activ=
ated the clause, but Olson said the S&P downgrade clearly fit the descripti=
on of a material adverse affect.   Also Wednesday, UBS Warburg and RBC Capi=
tal cut their ratings on Enron, to "hold" from "strong buy" and from "stron=
g buy" to "buy-speculative," respectively.  Lisa Sanders is a Dallas-based =

Hi Louise

Since I had some questions on the various names of the individuals I
was wondering if perhaps you could take a quick look at the attached
and see if there is anyone I have missed or inadvertently included.
Wouldn't want to get this wrong.

Thanks

Colette

Hi Louise.

This spreadsheet has life-to-date transaction counts for all counterparties for North American Gas and Power.  There are separate tabs for gas and power.   The top 50 in each case are highlighted.  Legal entitites are rolled up where it seemed appropriate (for instance, there are about 10 Aquila entities which are rolled up to a single Aquila count).

Looks good. Obviously very close to what I originally suggested!
 
I spoke with Michelle who seems ok with it. There was a suggestion from Lance that he wanted to make sure Muller and Top Gun were ok before we proceed. You may have heard independently from Muller on this point.
 
So, do you want me to get Julie Clyatt tee'd up, to prepare with names and numbers?

Following up on our discussion.......

Thank you for taking the lead to prep and set up a meeting(s) to get the appropriate team(s) prepared to testify on January 24, 2002.

I realize that there will be many different activities underway in the next couple of weeks, and we all include maintaining / maximizing the value of the CA book and the CPUC activities as critically important.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Good point - assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want. 

Obviously we shouldn't bother with bridgeline, peoples or anything like that.

I think so - respond rejecting his statements on ENE and state we expect fair treatment with other BBB credits.  Meanwhile we'll send the margin - our guys should be able to minimize the position.

Hi Randy, Bill.

As per our discussion this afternoon Randy,

Enron Corp. (Enron) has deteriorated further in the market place and the
recent downgrade of Enron by S&P to BBB, although not completely a surprise,
is still disconcerting.  I applaud Enron's effort in obtaining additional
Bank lines to shore up liquidity but am disappointed that your Pipeline
assets had to be pledge in support of same.  Additionally, Moody's and S&P
have stated publicly that further downgrade is possible.

I would like to remind you that NGX does not provide any unsecured lines to
entities who are rated below BBB.

As you well know, given NGX's size and the fact that NGX needs to keep the
integrity of the exchange intact, we have no option but to inform you of the
following.

Accordingly, please be advised that EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY Enron Canada Corp
(ECC) will no longer have any unsecured lines here at NGX (reference
attached Contracting Party's Agreement, Schedule C, para 3.0.a).

We respectfully request that ECC provide Collateral (preferably Irrevocable
Letter of Credit, else Registered Interest in Cash) by the close of business
day Monday, November 5, 2001 (reference Contracting Party's Agreement,
Schedule C, para 8.1).

As I said, if some other counterparty was in the position you are in right
now, you would expect us to do what it takes to keep the exchange
safe/intact/whole at all times.

Please call if you have any questions.

Need Michelle to help categorise under headings I suggested. Michelle, if you agree with my analysis can I ask Kari just to resort these so I can give to Lavo tomorrow in that format?
 
Clearly, the below is useful, but what Lavo asked was, which ENA contracts do we really have little chance of enforcing or are in danger of defaulting under. As such while we know per below that some of attached we haven't delivered on, I want to make sure we give him an indication of whether that it itself mean we have no argument to enforce.

in the master purchase agreements to designate a third party to take

Frank,

We have already done a number of things to help reduce AEP's exposure to Enron, none of which were required contractually.  We made a margin payment of $50,000,000.  We arranged ring-trades with Allegheny which reduced your exposure by over $90,000,000.  We have proposed a number of assignments which would reduce your exposure to Enron incrementally.  

Conversely, pursuant to our contracts AEP has failed to pay a $1,311,625.46 swap settlement that was due on 11/8/01.  Additionally, a margin call which was due to Enron on 11/8/01 in the amount of $19,250,000 and remains unpaid.  Additionally, AEP has failed to continue to trade with Enron which was not our understanding of the agreement.

Enron maintains its investment grade credit rating and is receiving $1.5 billion of additional funded equity capital from Dynegy as announced on Friday.  We are more than happy to continue helping you to reduce exposures in mutually agreeable manners but do not agree to the below list of requests.  We need you to address these above issues before we can progress on these exposure reductions.

Regards,
Bill

Per our conversation on November 12, 2001, AEP has reassessed it's risk tolerance for Enron Corporation.  In light of the current status, we propose the following things to be done to allow for normal trading and other business activity to commence: 
        A fully executed Master Set Off Agreement (MSA) with an Adequate Assurance provision and no MAC clauses. 
        An agreement that allows for same day margining 
        Cash collateral or Letter of Credit to bring exposure down to zero 
        Work towards executing an EEI Agreement 
        HPL post closing settlement payment must be paid as agreed by both parties 
        Settlement of all payments due and past due 

These are the critical issues we feel must be addressed to get things back to normal.  We appreciate all that has been done thusfar in working to mitigate our exposure, however, we now feel that more should be done to protect what we have at risk. 

I look forward to your reply, should you have any questions, comments or otherwise, please give me a call.

Subject:	Kiodex

Raj Vaswani, the general counsel for Kiodex, called me to pass along two messages:

1.	If a new  joint venture is created to resurrect EnronOnline, Kiodex would be interested in pursuing a business relationship with the new joint venture.  I told him that it was much too early to predict whether this would be of interest to a new trading company, but I told him I would relay Kiodex's interest to you. 

2.	Kiodex may be interested in repurchasing the shares in Kiodex currently owned by Enron Net Works LLC.  He did not know what the price would be, but wanted to know if we would be interested.  Since Net Works is a filed company, we would probably have to get the bankruptcy court's approval to sell.   I assume that if the price is right we are interested in pursuing this.  Let me know.

Thanks, Anne

There seems to be some confusion around who will own the intellectual property for the treasury workstation application.  It was Mary's and my understanding that the IP would remain with the estate and a license would be given to Netco to use the application.  Jay was under the impression that the IP was to be transferred to Netco.  Could someone please clarify.  

The estate (Mary Perkins) would like the IP to remain with the estate.  If this is a problem - please call Mary directly.

Thanks,

	Steve Harrington was on our original list to NETCO employees and he has asked to stay with the estate.  Therefore we wish to replace Steve with Jason McNair.  Jason has agreed to make the switch.

	Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with this request.  

	Thanks.   JR

I talked with Despain.  They are still in committee.  Tim has told them we need a response before early Houston time for the market to digest any announcement.

Subject:	Update on SRP Margin Call
Importance:	High

Tim,

As you know, SRP made a margin call to EPMI on Monday, by letter, seeking $5.5 million in margin under a "one-off" contract.  Tracy and I sent a letter back on Tuesday, arguing that the contract does not permit SRP to call for additional margin unless ENE is downgraded to junk status.  SRP responded to our letter this afternoon.  Predictably, SRP disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin.  SRP says that it will treat our failure to post $5.5 million by Monday, November 12, in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit, as an event of default and will terminate the contract.  If this happens, EPMI would have to make a payment of $5.5 million within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from SRP.

As you know, Tracy and I strongly believe that the contract does not support SRP's right to call for margin at this time.  However, the contract is not perfect (they drafted it, after all) and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position.  

I recommend that we treat the SRP-EPMI dispute regarding the margining criteria under this Agreement as a "Dispute" under Section 17.  Disputes are first submitted to Authorized Representatives (each company designates an Authorized Representative) to resolve.  If the Authorized Representatives cannot reach agreement within 30 days, then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at SRP (the "Executives").  The Executives have to meet within 30 days to resolve the issue.  If the Executives cannot resolve the issue within 30 days, then both parties can choose arbitration, or either party can take the matter to court.  In summary, best case, this option gets us up to 90 days before we have to arbitrate/litigate the issue.  Otherwise, we better prepare to post collateral Monday.

If you want to handle this matter by taking the "Dispute" route, I should send a letter out tomorrow to SRP giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract's "Dispute" provisions.

Steve

(I should also mention that Tracy has informed me that SRP plans to issue a margin call on our WSPP contracts (approximately $4.5 million) as soon as it calculates the amount due.)

Trouble withthe 13mm in back office bonuses. Advisors for creditors committee say take it out of their residual ownership. That would mean that we don't have the cash unless the buyer picks it up.

Hi Louise,

We are having a typical trading pace so far today.  It is too early to tell if any counterparty is really cutting back.  Like yesterday, however, Aquila is buying longer dated physical gas and selling spot gas; so once again they are a big net buyer.

Trade counts, by 8:30 am, since October 1:

There is an open issue with respect to how the URL address will be positioned between the estate and NETCO.  It was my understanding that we wanted it retained at the estate with a pointer to NETCO, and a window box back to EOL.  Please call John Casaucoumeq (with whom I understand you will be speaking tomorrow at some time) (212 723 9661) and determine with him how this is to work.  Citi lawyer said however you and he work it out will be satisfactory as it is a business issue.  Please let Anne and I know.  Thanks.  Mary

Tom Moran let me know that the Crude Desk covered their short position with BP.  He believes that BP will require that we prepay before 11/30/01 approximately $20mm.  We will try to get more details from the crude desk next week.

SENT ON BEHALF OF DEREK FLAMAN:

The following is a response to Bill's question: "When does the tariff require the LC to be renewed?  Do we have some time to wait until mid-December?"

Also attached to this email is Lori Poffenroth's November 9 memo which sets forth Lori's calculations based on WSP/PPA's formulas set forth in their tariffs for Initial Amounts, Revised Amounts, Recommended October 31 Amounts, and Estimated December 31 Amounts.

All of the WSP's and the PPA's Prudential Requirements allow the WSP's and the PPA to reevaluate EDCC's credit limit and/or request additional security from time to time.  While the following sets out in more detail the manner in which each WSP and the PPA can do this, all of the Prudential Requirements are the same in the following two respects: (1) if at any time EDCC's financial obligations to the WSP/PPA (the "Financial Obligations") exceed the existing credit limit (or a certain percentage thereof), the WSP/PPA has the right to request additional security (the "Additional Security"); and (2) if EDCC fails to post the Additional Security within the requisite time period, the WSP/PPA reserves the right to suspend service to EDCC.

Note that, as of today, no WSP/PPA has requested Additional Security.  

However, as soon as possible, the following needs to occur in those instances where the October 31 Amount exceeds the Existing Amount: (1) we should post the Additional Security now; or (2) we put ourselves in a position to be able to post the Additional Security within the requisite time period.  Consequently, we do have some time to wait until mid-December provided that (2) has occurred.

As at December 31, we must post the December 31 Amount.

ATCO

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$300,000	$300,000	$450,000	

As at October 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $300,000 and the posted security is $300,000; therefore, no Additional Security is currently required.  As at December 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $450,000 and the posted security will have expired; therefore $450,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time.  Such Additional Security will be due within 5 days of ATCO's request.

Enmax

Calgary	
Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$475,000	$750,000	$1,850,000	


Red Deer	
Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$30,000	$40,000	$75,000	


Lethbridge	
Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$15,000	$35,000	$65,000	


As at October 31: for Calgary, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $750,000 and the posted security is $475,000 - therefore, the Additional Security which may be required is $275,000; for Red Deer, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $40,000 and the posted security is $30,000 - therefore, $10,000 of Additional Security may be required; for Lethbridge, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $35,000 and the posted security is $15,000 - therefore, $20,000 of Additional Security may be required.

As at December 31: for Calgary, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $1,850,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $1,850,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time; for Red Deer, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $75,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $75,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time; for Lethbridge, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $65,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $65,000 of Additional Security will be required.  

All of the foregoing Additional Security is due within the number of days required by Enmax (i.e. at Enmax's discretion).

EPCOR

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$150,000	$150,000	$1,000,000	

Ponoka

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$5,000	$12,000	$12,000	

As at October 31: for EPCOR, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $150,000 and the posted security is $150,000 - therefore, no Additional Security is currently required; for Ponoka, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $12,000 and the posted security is $5,000 - therefore, $7,000 of Additional Security may be required.

As at December 31: for EPCOR, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $1,000,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $1,000,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time; for Ponoka, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $12,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $12,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time.

All of the aforementioned Additional Security is due within 10 business days of EPCOR's request.

Power Pool of Alberta "PPA"

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$4,800,000	$2,500,000	$6,000,000	

As at October 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $2,500,000 and the posted security is $4,800,000 - therefore, no Additional Security is currently required.

As at December 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $6,000,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $6,000,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time.

All of the aforementioned Additional Security is due within the number of days set by the PPA (i.e. at the PPA's discretion)

UtiliCorp.

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$0	Barry/Lori to calculate	Barry/Lori to calculate	

UtiliCorp.'s Prudential Requirements, like the other WSP's and PPA's Prudential Requirements, allow UtiliCorp. to re-evaluate EDCC's credit limit and/or request Additional Security from time to time.  To date, UtiliCorp. has not exercised their right to request Additional Security from EDCC.  As such, Financial Obligations with respect to UtiliCorp. have not been calculated.  To be prudent, Barry/Lori will calculate a Recommended October 31 Amount and an Estimated December 31 Amount so that we are prepared in the event that UtiliCorp. does at some point exercise its right to require us to post Additional Security.

Regards,

Derek

Guys - we have a $50 mm claim riding on this - it would appear that we have nothing but upside - if we lose we won't pay - if we win it's cash to us.  Brobeck is owed $2 mm - and we obviously need to pay the experts as well.  

Mark - I need some guidance on this - please advise.  Thanks,

Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -Traders
By Mark Golden

11/20/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell
power and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday
morning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of
Enron's quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said.

  For weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron for
future deliveries. But for the first time since Enron's troubles began a month
ago, energy companies weren't selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear
that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month.
  "It's pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for
now," said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates in
Houston.

  Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn't sell to
Enron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the
situation, but declined to say so on the record.

  "Nobody will take Enron," one western electricity broker said. After
struggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willing
to sell to Enron Tuesday morning.

  Calpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it was
willing to sell power to Enron.

  "We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation
closely," spokeswoman Catherine Potter said.

  The situation Tuesday morning was fluid. One utility that refused to sell to
Enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon, a person at the
company said. That company's trading, however, was still limited to the spot
markets.

  Credit concerns about the once-dominant energy trading company were
heightened with Enron's filing of its third quarter annual report Monday
evening with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.

  Enron may have to pay $690 million on a note that became a demand obligation
with the company's most recent credit-rating downgrade, Enron said in Monday's
filing. The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could
be hurt by credit concerns, a decline in asset values and reduced trading
activity.

  "The 10Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns," Fitch
analyst Ralph Pellecchia said. "We have a lot of questions outstanding
relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they
are going to manage the situation."

  Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets,
because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no
credit risk for the buyer.

Hi Louise, 
 
Beth has reorganized the front and back office groups enough now that I don't know all of the key individuals anymore.  But in most cases, there is someone I trust still around who knows the details about a particular system, so I've tried to identify that person and how many extra people (probably best chosen by that individual) would be needed at a minimum.  
 
I have included at the bottom a small list of "cannot lose" individuals.  In such a small organization, it would be critical, of course, to have people that can solve problems in any system.  If EnronOnline was shut down, I would also put Belmont, Guadarrama, Hillier, Jenson in the "cannot lose" group, and I would make sure that Amanullah was one of the remaining Oracle DBAs. 
 
Excluding Jenny and SAP (currently this is not in Mark's organization and I cannot find any data on it), I have listed a total of 33 people.

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?

No change in cash at this time.  Agreement will provide for netting and set-off only upon an event of default in an underlying agreement.  Cash in/out will depend upon positions at that time.

Doug,

I believe that we should also extend the time period for the reference of disputed items on the Working Capital Statement since we may not resolve everything by the 4th of December (given the holidays), which by my calculations would be the date for referral of disputed working capital items to the independent auditors.  Perhaps we could go ahead and build in an extension period for the working capital items that would coincide with the extension for the inventory.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks, Anne

The DPR for 11/30/01 is now complete and has been published to the ERV.

For the last few days, the production of the DPR has been put on hold due to the increased activity around terminations.  Positions and VAR for the DPR will start to be produced for trading day 12/10/01 and we are planning to produce a full DPR (inclusive of P&L) on a weekly basis.

Please call if you have any questions.

Best regards

2.added acceleration of ena's payment obligations in the event of default by enron parties under the master and close-out by the dynegy parties.
3.added set off right to dynegy parties if they end up owing under the master to the remaining payment obligations of ena.

re the master netting agreement which you will send:
1. added cross default to ena's payment obligations under the sithe letter.
2. added set off right to dynegy parties like in 3. above.

I think we urgently (next 2 days) need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk. Counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business, both in the US and UK. I have two suggestions:

-allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity
or
-appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed.

For example, EGM wants to send out $200- $300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with Koch. 

We do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast. I will try to set up a meeting tomorrow.

Laura - I had a conversation with Chuck Daverio yesterday to discuss our "next steps" going forward.  The discussion was positive and we felt it was worthwhile to have a follow-up joint conference call this coming Monday after the holiday.  I continued to highlight the positive aspects of the Peoples relationship and the benefits to keep moving forward with Enron and/or Enron/Dynegy.  He's looking forward to the New York function and having some dialogue with us and  Bill Morrow.  

FYI - we received comments back from KeySpan on the Settlement Agreement resolving all outstanding issues associated with the Asset Management Agreement, the Gas Purchase Agreement and  past imbalances with Transco.  KeySpan changed the format of the Settlement Agreement, however the revised documents are in pretty good shape.  I've got a meeting with Jeff Hodge tomorrow morning to finalize the agreements.

Let's discuss when you return from your cruise!

The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=
on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "=
informal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=

Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=

 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=
he company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.=20

To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=

ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=
nyone?=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America

Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "W=
ho knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their app=
roach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do."

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=
ow about the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=
ef financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder eq=
uity. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for detai=
ls.=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad=
 news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compa=
ny's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term f=
ortunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=
y's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's l=
owered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it cr=

ewswire/ -- The law firm of Berger & Montague, P.C., (http://www.bergermont=

Corp. ("Enron" or the "Company") (NYSE: ENE) and its principal officers and=
 directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of=
 Texas on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Enron securities =
during the period from March 30, 2000 through and including October 18, 200=
1, inclusive (the "Class Period"). ?The complaint alleges that Enron and it=
s principal officers and directors violated Section 10(b) and 20 (a) of the=
 Securities Exchange Act of l934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaint alleges =
that defendants misled investors (1) by reporting assets that were overvalu=
ed by more than $1 billion, which caused writedowns in that amount and are =
expected to lead to further writeoffs of hundreds of millions of dollars, (=
2) by concealing facts regarding relationships with a related entity that l=

llion charge, and (3) by obfuscating or failing to disclose the fact that a=
greements with other related entities satisfaction of which include obligat=
ions that may require the Company to issue large amounts of its shares. Thi=
s misconduct caused the market prices of Enron stock to be artificially inf=
lated during the Class Period. When facts about these matters were disclose=
d at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Company's per sha=
re stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low=
 of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the =
Company's stock despite the precurietous fall in its market price. Also, En=
ron's senior debt was placed on notice by Moody's for possible downgrade.?A=
lso, an SEC inquiry into the Company's transactions with related entities h=
as been announced, and the Company revealed that its Chief Financial Office=
r, who is one of the Defendants, has taken a "leave of absence" from the Co=
mpany, and has been replaced. ?If you purchased Enron securities during the=
 period from March 30, 2000 through October 18, 2001, inclusive, you may, n=

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 23 /PRNewswire/ -- The Law Firm of Cauley Geller Bo=
wman & Coates, LLP announced today that a class action has been filed in th=
e United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston =
Division on behalf of purchasers of Enron Corp. ("Enron" or the "Company") =
(NYSE: ENE) common stock during the period between January 18, 2000 and Oct=
ober 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period"). A copy of the complaint file=
d in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on the firm'=
s website at http://www.classlawyer.com/pr/enron.pdf .=20
The complaint charges that Enron and certain of its officers and directors =
violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a=
nd Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misre=
presentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, =
thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specificall=
y, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concernin=
g its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (=
i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declinin=
g demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market=
 for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market particip=
ants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were =
materially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write- d=
own the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which we=
re managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron w=
as failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance wi=
th GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that=
 the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, o=
r ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period =
ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material por=
tion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain lim=
ited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer =
and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in sharehold=
er equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news beg=
an to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped=
 significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $7=
3 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting inves=
tors.
If you bought Enron common stock between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2=
001, inclusive, and you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the =
Court no later than December 21, 2001. If you are a member of this class, y=

HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. plunged Monday after the energy trading gi=

t the company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed =
by an Enron senior officer.=20
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with infor=
mation in response to an inquiry last week.
"We welcome this request," Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenne=
th L. Lay said Monday. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forwa=

=20
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down $5.=
40 to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston- based E=
nron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a $16 million pre- tax gain to =
Enron in 1999 and a $36 million loss in 2000.=20
Enron officials would not provide details about the transactions or identif=
y the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the=
 annual report on related party transactions.=20
"Enron entered into transactions with [limited partnerships] to hedge certa=
in merchant investments and other assets," according to the section.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week an=
d described the request is an "informal inquiry."=20
"This is not an investigation," he said. "We see the request as an opportun=
ity to put this issue behind us."=20
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings.=20

Enron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day

Enron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Over lunch in a conference
room at Boston's Four Seasons Hotel last Thursday, Enron Corp.
Chairman Kenneth Lay tried to convince analysts and investors that
the company has no more surprises.

     With the analysts, he apparently succeeded. Enron remains one
of Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largest
energy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run
by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billion
in shareholder equity.

     Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandoned
Enron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.

     ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has
no clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., who
today repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts at
Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firms
have also kept their highest ratings on Enron.

     Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The core
franchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock's
decline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.

     In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York,
Lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and other
Enron executives assured investors the company has no more
surprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1
billion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Boston
session.

     The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity
funds, according to analysts and investors, and included
investments that lost money. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has asked for more information about them, Enron said
yesterday.

                        One Hold, One Sell

     While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings after
learning about the partnerships, they only dented the company's
popularity on Wall Street.

     Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered
his rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has been
looking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings
and is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him with
a ``good comfort level.''

     With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second
most highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the
10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.

     Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut
Enron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones,
which caters to individual investors rather than institutions,
aren't tracked by First Call.

     First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with
``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages the
ratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The most
highly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12
percent this year.

     Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.

                        Remaining Skeptical

     However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have to
remain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L.
Babson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

     ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility at
Enron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and the
unexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held
the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir
apparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's
departure) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.

     Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company
into the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns power
plants in deregulated markets.

     Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a
buyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information about
what else might pop up in the future.''

     Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not
providing enough information about its businesses, and they said
this makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more
difficult to understand.

     After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more
open about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Boston
was ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,''
according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.

                         Amazed, Dismayed

     Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a
note to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingness
of Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the
degree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''

     Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent
`disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not
disclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in
the earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at
``buy.''

     Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side''
believes that investment banking business has helped keep Wall
Street recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some good
underwriting business,'' he said.

     Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12
million Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting
as co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for
Enron this year.



Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from
money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its
finances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or
short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.

     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of
the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible
downgrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the
commercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also
wouldn't comment.

     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.
They have fallen 76 percent this year.

                         Complex Financing

     An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two
partnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
cost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow's
leadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's
books, a conflict of interest.

     Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in
some partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken
Lay on the conference call with investors today.

     The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal
report on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million
shares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion,
the Journal said.

     The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated
companies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. The
partnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it
borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading,
Enron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and
other commodities.

     ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' said
Commerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain the
full impact on shareholders.''

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion in
such ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

                      Depends on Asset Sales

     One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred
shares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewing
partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron
common stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit
rating drops under investment grade.

     Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include
company executives as officers and directors, according to records
from the Texas secretary of state.

     ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact
issued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan
said. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part
of a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.

     The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in
bonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds to
buy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling
them, officials said on the conference call. Other company
partnerships operate with the same strategy.

     ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the
full amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to
the detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the
company's debt at investment grade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.



How Enron Blew It
Texas Monthly
November 2001

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20

>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.
"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday=
 to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock.=20
But worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and=
 the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance=
 sheet transaction.=20
The transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex=
 financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which wa=
s led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement =
led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron =
stock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion is probing "related party transactions." Executives declined to respon=
d to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c=
all.=20
Another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said o=
n the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q=
uarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said =
the company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share f=
or 2001 and $2.15 for 2002.=20
When a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assu=
ming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivale=
nt to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a =
result, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about th=
at much, assuming constant earnings.=20
When asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, =
CEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for =
this year. He then affirmed the 2002 number.=20
Now, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned r=
eduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l=
evel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. =
Notably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning=
 a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternative=
ly, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company ha=
s simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties=
 in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed=
.=20
Calls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday =
after falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-bal=
ance sheet deals.=20
The call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries =
about two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borro=
wed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma=
n of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who wa=
s called an "a--hole" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe=
rence call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin=
 II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to =
sell the water assets.=20
Grubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl=
y about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million t=
o pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after=
 factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to wa=
ter assets, some of which are included in Marlin II.=20
Lay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of d=
riving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In =
the middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the n=
ext caller.=20
Grubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.=20
If Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or rai=
sing cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it=
's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said li=
quidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in availabl=
e credit lines.=20
But if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of =
those lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other c=
harges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (En=
ron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal=
culation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus=
h Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.=20

AES Says Indian State Interfering In Ops, Complains To PM

10/23/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW DELHI (AP)--After Enron Corp. it is the turn of U.S.-based AES Corp. to=
 seek the Indian prime minister's help to settle its grievances with a stat=
e government.=20
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke =
said his company's determination to continue in India was being tested by t=
he government of eastern Orissa state.
The letter, a copy of which was made available to the Associated Press Tues=
day, was dated Oct. 1 and appeared to have been faxed to the office of Prim=
e Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.=20
The Virginia-based energy company operates two power plants in Orissa, hold=
s 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distr=
ibution company in the state.=20
AES Corp. is the other major American power company besides Enron Corp. to =
have made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign inv=
estment in the power sector in the early 1990s.=20
In his letter, Bakke drew Vajpayee's attention to the "expropriation, repea=
ted contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-=
to-day management" by the state government and its agencies. The letter als=
o complained about government-run agencies failing to pay 2.1 billion rupee=
s ($1=3DINR47.985) in bills.=20
"If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine =
the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India," Bakke wrote. "Whil=
e AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like=
 to serve, our determination to continue is being tested."=20
The prime minister's office said it wasn't ready to comment on the report. =
Officials of the Orissa state government weren't available to respond to Ba=
kke's charges in view of a Hindu festival.=20
AES Corp. has already offered to withdraw from the distribution company - k=
nown as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, it has s=
aid that the company will continue with its interests in electricity genera=
tion.=20
If AES Corp. decides to pull out completely, it will the third American com=
pany to do so.=20
Cogentrix Inc. quit a power project in southern India before it was started=
, while Houston-based Enron is in the process of withdrawing from the Dabho=
l Power Project in western Maharashtra state, India's biggest ever foreign =
investment project.=20
On Sept. 14, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay wrote a letter to Vajpayee=
 threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5 billion relating to =
the Dabhol Power Co. dispute and questioned India's ability to honor its co=
ntracts.=20
Lay had also warned that India may find it hard to attract foreign investor=
s in the future because of the payment dispute with the Dabhol project, whi=
ch stopped production and construction in May.

Louise,

The consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the Power guys would like to have a full blown Master Agreement on EnronOnline instead of a simpler GTC.

Obviously, I can put either onto EnronOnline, but wanted to let you know before we do so.

If you want us to stick with a simple GTC, please let me know.

Thanks,

Dave

Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  

Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally

We've updated the Merger Q&A document on our Enron Updates site ( <http://home.enron.com/updates/mergerQA.html>), as a result of the many questions you've had concerning the merger between Enron and Dynegy. Questions addressed include those about Enron stock options, benefits and immigration status. Please stay tuned for additional updates.

Here are the current items and projected disbursements in E-Next for plant development.

1. Ft Pierce HRSG is an option payment. Once the option is exercised, I believe the remaining payments would be made over the following 12 month period.
2. Longview Turbines: We continue to make progress payments. I believe the payments will be completed over the following 12 months as well.
3. Cascade Agreement/Transformer: Awaiting Notice to Proceed. Cascade will be paid over 4 months. Transformer over 1 year.

I've attached a list of guaranty amendments issued indicating monetary increases for the period October 1 - November 13.  Additionally, we issued a guaranty today and I thought you might want to include the information on the guaranty list I provided you yesterday.  The information is below.

I spoke with berney this AM.  As you mentioned, I believe he needs some more $ (a risk premium in his words).  I told him that the intent is not to simply be a block-trading spec shop, but we do have a genuine interest in structured customer deals.  Also, the size of his group is irrelevant because the marketers will be asked to structure on their own and I will want Berney to have some oversight to ensure quality and consistency, as well as helping out on all of the big deals.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Louise:

Please find attached Americas' (physical gas, physical power, and financial trading) accounts receivable aging data.  To interpret the data, use the color codes as follows below.  

Pink indicates that the Settlements group has passed the receivable to our internal legal counsel for review.  Enron's legal action vis a vis the receivable against the counterparty includes notification of delinquency, invitation to negotiation, as well as, but, not necessarily, action through the courts.  
Yellow indicates that Credit is proceeding with an investigation of the receivable claim.
Blue means that a non-cash reconciliation adjustment to the books is being made.  Adjustments are being made for reasons that include accounting entry assignment corrections and physical delivery volume true-ups.
Purple signals a California-related receivable.  Possible outcomes for these amounts include non-cash adjustment and designation as a valid collectible.
Green indicates for the receivable in question that cash has been collected, a non-cash adjustment has been made, or reconciled, but that the receivable has not cleared the register because of the timing of this report.
No color indicates the receivable is less than $200,000 and was not investigated.

For most receivables a synopsis of action or reference has been provided.  

Also included in the file are receivables generated by PG&E.  The physical gas and physical power receivables are over 120 days in arrears and are attributable to March 2001 production (April 2001 collection).

We have provided you this file electronically so that you may see the details and be able to sort and manipulate the data.  A hard copy can be produced.  Tim Proffitt, the Settlement team members, and I are available to sit with you to further investigate our receivable claims and answer any questions you may have regarding the data presented.

Sincerely,
Chris Herron

My group has scrubbed the teams per your request and excluded items such as rent, outside legal costs, systems development, etc. If you look at the individual team tab towards the bottom of the spreadsheet you'll see the items that have been removed. We've also adjusted Other Expenses for any unusual items that may have been coded there. Please let me know if you'd like for us to forecast 2002 expenses based on this information.

to be clear
 
No employees to Mariner exept Keel and Josey initially.  Melendrez and Bushman to Mariner in 3 to 4 months.  The other employees (i think 5) will get the severence package once they have helped us sell the assets under Jesus's direction.

Louise,

Effective 1/1/02 we increased his salary to $200,000/year per your recommendation.  Not sure if anyone has communicated it to him yet?

Also, we increased Stuart Zisman's salary to $150,000/year effective 1/1/02.  Don plans to communicate.

Thanks,

Robert

Enron Paid Out 'Retention' Bonuses Before Bankruptcy Filing

December 6, 2001

By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and KURT EICHENWALD




Just days before Enron (news/quote) filed for bankruptcy
and laid off 4,000 people, it paid out $55 million in
bonuses to about 500 employees, according to several people
who had dealings with the company.

Yesterday evening, an Enron spokesman confirmed the
bonuses, describing them as "retention incentives" for
crucial employees. Bankruptcy experts said that the
payments were almost certain to be closely scrutinized -
and probably challenged - by Enron's creditors.

Separately, the Labor Department said yesterday that it had
opened an investigation into how Enron managed its
employees' 401(k) retirement plans. Those accounts were
heavily invested in Enron shares, and company rules
prohibited many employees from diversifying their holdings.
The Labor Department said that employees had lost up to 90
percent of the value of their accounts.

"Enron's employees have gotten the short end of the stick
in the sudden collapse of this company," said Labor
Secretary Elaine L. Chao. Enron has said that a temporary
freeze that kept some employees from shifting retirement
investments was long planned and allowed another company to
take over the job of administering the plan.

Enron declined to say how much was paid out in bonuses, who
received the money or what the range of payments was.

Executives of companies entering bankruptcy defend such
payments as necessary if there is to be any hope of
reorganizing as a going concern. But they often prove to be
incendiary. For example, in 1990, when it was disclosed
that Drexel Burnham Lambert had paid key executives some
$250 million in bonuses before filing for bankruptcy,
creditors and the government reacted with outrage. In the
end, after court hearings on the issue, the Drexel estate
sued the employees to get the money back.

The payments by Enron "are substantially high, and that
means it probably does become an issue in the bankruptcy
case," said James Feder, a bankruptcy lawyer with Feder &
Mills, a law firm in Los Angeles. "The question might come
up as to whether there was fair consideration given for the
amount of these bonuses and whether they were reasonable
under the circumstances."

If creditors can convince the court that the employees were
overpaid - or that the payments were made to keep money out
of creditors' hands, a much more difficult argument to
prove - then the judge can void the payments and order the
money returned, said Lynn LoPucki, a law professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles.

To tamp down such disputes, a company typically will file a
request, as part of its bankruptcy filing, to make payments
to certain employees, and not proceed with the payments
until receiving a judge's approval, Mr. LoPucki said.

Yesterday, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, defended the
payments as necessary "in order to protect and maintain the
value of the estate." Such payments "are done in every
bankruptcy," he said, adding that the payments were made to
employees "at all levels of the organization."

Employees who lost their jobs after Enron filed for
bankruptcy protection on Sunday were told they may receive
no more than $4,500 in severance pay. They also were told
to petition the bankruptcy court to cash in unused vacation
days.

In another legal slap at Enron, a shareholder lawsuit filed
late Tuesday accused 29 Enron officers and directors of
engaging in "massive insider trading" and making "false and
misleading" statements about the company's financial
performance while selling about $1.1 billion worth of stock
over the last three years.

An Enron spokesman declined to comment on the suit, which
was filed by Amalgamated Bank, which is known to be an
activist shareholder.

Louise,

Can you please confirm to Treasury that we can send the wire originally scheduled for Friday on Wednesday (amount of (9,000,000 CAD).  Mike needs to have all of the cash with NGX by tomorrow morning so that be can trade the 5 day block tomorrow.  I have discussed with Robin in Treasury, but she needs your written authorization to amend the date in the system.  We are also sending them a wire for $6MM tomorrow as originally planned. The total wires for the week will be CAD 24,000,000.

Thanks,

I just told Mitch that I might be able to get him a little more $ in the form of cash/equity and mitigate his non-compete concerns.   He asked about the title and raise and said that you suggested title was possible and probably the only way to get more $.  Is he working us?  I am OK with a VP promotion because he sure seems like some of the other VP's, but Kevin did not think he earned it.  As such, I have been trying to convince him that there is no difference between VP and Director; he is one of 15 lead marketers (half VP, half Director) and he will be compared to his peers and more importantly he will be compensated based primarily on financial performance.   
 
Bottom Line: VP with base of $150 gets him done.  I am trying to get him done with $25 cash/equity plus a $15K raise.  If you think it is better to bite the bullet and make him a VP, I am ok but we need to talk with Kevin.  
 
I know this sounds flaky, but I don't know these East guys as well as you and Kevin do so I am relying on your input.

Hi Louise,

We are having a typical trading pace so far today.  It is too early to tell if any counterparty is really cutting back.  Like yesterday, however, Aquila is buying longer dated physical gas and selling spot gas; so once again they are a big net buyer.

Trade counts, by 8:30 am, since October 1:

Hi Louise.  A few questions/issues when you have a moment:

1. Will NetCo need a copy of Infinity for interest rate/fx trading and risk management?  I pitched the question to Jeff Golden.  He thinks the bank will provide this function and the technology, but he wasn't 100% sure.

2. We have a potential problem with visas.  Bob Hillier is on an L1 visa, and many of the development staff are on H1B's.  Once we get a letter from the new entity stating that these people have employment, the transfer process can begin, but it will take at least a week for L1 and 2-3 weeks for H1B (this is what I am told).  If closing happens very quickly after the actual party is chosen, we are going to be squeezed.  One solution may be to let all these people continue to work for Enron until the visa transfer is complete.  Otherwise, we will have to send them home without salary or benefits in the meantime.  

3.  When you have a moment, I would like to talk to you about two EES people.

Thanks!
 -jay

I have also assumed we take everyone in the Calgary and Portland offices - so I've missed them off the list.  I've got names if you need them.

So here's how it works.  The attached spreadsheet has three MASTER worksheets:

(i)  Energy  Operations 
(ii) IT
(iii) Support Services

All the rest of the worksheets are back up documentation for the rankings.

Please identify the people on the Masters who actually have contracts.

Thanks

Hi Dave  
Here is a revised draft for discussion purposes only of the MNA, marked to show changes from the prior draft of 11/8.

Please call if you have any questions or comments. Thanks

In speaking with Constellation this morning (trying to assign some of our New England deals to them), they said they had heard that Enron was establishing a data room in Houston for the purpose of selling off its book of business (in fact they indicated they were sending a team down today).  To that end, they are highly interested in speaking with someone about the book from a macro level.  Please let me know who I should have them call.  Otherwise, the contact there is Sarah Wright at 410-468-3483.   I'm at 978-449-9936 if you'd like to discuss
 
Regards
John

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks

Subject:        Re-start/Integration Planning 

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month

Kim mentioned that you're on the phone. Jenny designated the Disaster Recovery piece ($10M) and some other items as Capital Expenses, and we neglected to include this in our schedule. The total capital budget is $14.7M. I presume that you'll want to include this amount? 

What we currently have is expense plan of 24.9M with a 1.2 multiple equals 30.2m.

I think we'll want to amend it :

24.9M 	expense
14.7M	capital

39.6M	total (would you still want a multiple to increase to 47.5M?)

We have a call in for En Ops as well to make sure that there isn't any potential capital plan we might need to include.

Please let me know!

Please, keep in mind, that the members of the Research Group
who stayed behind to facilitate the transition will be leaving 
for good, in a week. We have to accelerate the process.

There seems to be some confusion around the calculation of books on 11/30/2001.  All books were run properly in the gas and power area on 11/30, as that was the last day prior to the bankruptcy declaration.  Please let myself or Sally Beck know if you have any questions regarding this.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

OK. I know that!
 
I wasn't planning to "promote" all the Managers to Director however. Just retitle them, leave their salaries as is. If we want to give them all bumps to $115 (from $95), then I'll start water dropping that.
 
I was assuming you wanted 2 or 3 new MD's, 5 or 10 new VP's and probably 50 or 60 other incidental changes on the support side between Specialists and Snr Directors (presuming we don't do away with titles for support folks).

Information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to (i) confidentiality provisions with counterparties and (ii) with respect to power, the need for FERC approval .  Everyone seems to be comfortable that the identity of counterparties can be disclosed, as well as the counterparties contact information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular counterparty.  Consequently, the software going to Netco will  be cleansed of the trade data and individual's data bases and files should be similarly cleansed.

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?

Louise,

IT needs source code and documentation for all Exotica library functions. In addition, we need the Excel add-in build environment for building the exotica DLL and its help functionality. We need documentation for all models used by traders and risk managers. Naveen has a list of those models. My group can help maintain those models and the exotica library and provide IT expertise. I will help get a complete list of models used. Following is the list of Exotica functions.

Thanks

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Please see the attached reports detailing the gross and net payrolls for 11/29 (weekly/biweekly) and the 11/30 (semi) paydays.  I have also included the breakout by tax company for the Gross Amounts.   This first version has the tax company numbers as I wanted to get it to you as soon as possible.  We are in the process of including the names and will send you an updated file.


 


Please let me know if you need additional information.

Louise,

John Donnelly said his deal guys would like to see a slightly more detailed org chart which addressed what the org structure and main functions were under each of the technical and support areas. He gave me impression he wanted to understand for example what Accounting/CFO team did exactly. I think the chart we sent them previously was fairly detailed on the main commercial, senior management and EOL areas, but was silent below Webb(dev'lp), Hall, Rub, Colwell, myself, Headicke/Taylor, Bradford, Buy?, etc.,

Should I send a request around or would you prefer to send it?

Louise and Bill,

As you are aware, NBC has sent us notification of an event of default under=
 the ISDA due to our failure to post collateral (in the form of an LC).  To=
 date, NBC has resisted all of our commercial solutions to this issue.  At =
the close of business today, our cure period for the event of default will =
expire, and NBC will be able to draw on the $1.4MM LC posted and terminate =
the contract. Today we have seen a bit of movement in their position.  They=
 are now willing to accept cash as collateral if Enron will agree to reduce=
 its collateral threshold to some agreed upon amount.  Bill Bonnell, their =
credit manager, has suggested $4MM as the appropriate level. This would ent=
ail Enron posting $3MM in addition to the $500K collateral call for a total=
 of $3.5MM.  I believe we could more than likely negotiate the threshold to=
 $5MM if we are willing to post the cash.  A $5MM level would require an ad=
ditional posting of $2MM which is what we originally forecasted to try to b=
uy down the position exposure.  As we must have a resolution today to fores=
tall further action on the part of NBC, please advise as to management's wi=
llingness to use cash for the purpose of preventing termination of this con=
tract.

Thanks,
Tanya

Lance Schuler has a few comments to the draft I circulated last night.  Once I receive those from him, I'll send around a new version.
 
With regard to David's comments, I agree that we should be as specific as possible.  That said, however, if we aren't certain that all counterparties will agree to those specific terms, then we may not want to make those promises in this document.  Mary Jean -- what do you think?
 
What did the creditors' committee say about this today?
 
Michelle

The objective seems to have gotten alittle lost here. 

We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here). Bear in mind Umbrella had agreed to these terms and Mark M and Lance were to run them passed Top Gun. Presuming they did, seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actualy be (Lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen Umbrella's term sheet last week).

 The covering memo should be explicit in asking the ee to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms, they would sign them. The wording needs to be tight and regardless of it's enforceability make above clear. In other words let's make it look as binding as we can.

If we really can't do above let's say so and we can look at plan b. John, it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa Jan 10. However let's wait and see if we can get one more draft done for Weds.

Dear Mr. Lavorato:

Following up on your and Ken Lay's conversation with Gary Cohn, I would like

Markets and J.Aron.

> 1.  Enron Corp./J. Aron - FX Option sold by Enron Corp. to J. Aron with a
> settlement date of Dec 11, 01 would be settled on Nov 21, 01.
>
> 2.  Enron NA/GSCM - Interest Rate Swap Portfolio - At Enron NA's option,
> we would either (a) close out and portfolio on Nov 21, 01, resulting in a
> payment from GSCM to Enron NA or (b) bilaterally reduce applicable margin
> trigger from $10mm to zero, which based on current MTM would result in
> $10mm of additional margin being paid by GSCM to Enron NA.
>
> Weather Derivative Transaction - Applicable margin trigger would be
> reduced from $50mm to $5mm, which based on current MTM would result in
> ~$18mm of margin being paid by GSCM to Enron NA.
>
> 3.  Enron NA/J. Aron - Financial Derivative Portfolio - At Enron NA's
> option, we would either (a) close out and portfolio on Nov 21, 01,
> resulting in a payment from J. Aron to Enron NA or (b) bilaterally reduce

> would result in $10mm of additional margin being paid by J. Aron to Enron

Louise,

Seung-Taek Oh will be working for me as the head of real-time markets in Ercot. As a two year associate he would have been eligible for promotion to manager. He was also an UBS employee and as such was an associate director. I would like to change his title from undefined to associate director.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Doug

The objective seems to have gotten alittle lost here.

We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here). Bear in mind Umbrella had agreed to these terms and Mark M and Lance were to run them passed Top Gun. Presuming they did, seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actualy be (Lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen Umbrella's term sheet last week).

 The covering memo should be explicit in asking the ee to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms, they would sign them. The wording needs to be tight and regardless of it's enforceability make above clear. In other words let's make it look as binding as we can.

If we really can't do above let's say so and we can look at plan b. John, it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa Jan 10. However let's wait and see if we can get one more draft done for Weds.

John:

Appreciate seeing the old e-mail again, but remind you that the Shenhua cargo was agreed 22 Oct.  As mentioned, we will certainly try to push Shenhua to entertain alternative arrangements, but the Chinese are usually quite difficult on this subject (to date, all Chinese cargoes have required Enron to post an LC).  It's a good idea to get Shankman thinking about this one today, because it is likely that we will need to post an LC for this cargo.  If timing is an issue, I'm sure we can drag the process out a few weeks since delivery is not until mid-Jan.

Regardless, need your input as soon as possible on whether we can continue transacting business where cash collection is not coincident (or in advance of) cash out the door.

Thks,

Stu

Stu - 

As per the e-mail below, RAC must be contacted prior to transacting on an L/C basis.  This was the same message I conveyed to the Australian team early last week.  The Shenhua deal definitely falls within the description and is an issue to be resolved.

I will talk to Jeff Shankman today about the use of L/Cs and capital in the near future, and see what resolution can be reached with the positions and strategy you hold in your book.

In this current climate we should try wherever possible not to commit to posting collateral to counterparties for physical purchases of product unless absolutely necessary.  We should offer an Enron Corp guarantee as an alternative.  In the event that we are asked to post security to a counterparty would you please contact credit before doing so.
The credit hotline number is 36555

thanks for your co-operation.

	In addition to other requests from UBS concerning credit, these were added.  I forwarded these to Bill Bradford as well, but they are a bit more strategic so I'm sending them to you as well.  We are targeting tomorrow afternoon / evening to have a discussion with the UBS credit team.

To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

I don't know what happened to my previous message, but here are the details.

TD Securities is sending a team of 9 people to the data room tomorrow morning.  They should arrive between 8 and 8:30 Wednesday morning and stay through Thursday evening (They are planning on a late night on Wed).  

We are currently planning on using room 3371 for the data room, but are looking for another room that might be more accomodating for such a large group.  I will send you a list of TD's team members as soon as I get it.  Please let me know who your point person will be and the schedule for the initial meetings.

Thanks,
Mari

1-number of questiojns on this. Answer is you would get severence and their plan is quite generous (presuming rif rather than performance reasomn for separation). I'll get you details.
2-no msa contains a release from enron to ubs and ee's who "are hired" by UBS.
3-true.

Can talk about 1 more if needed.

Louise and David,

Couple of comments on the contract: 

- If I am terminated w/o cause, either the non-compete/non-solicit provision shall not apply or I should be paid a severance.  As I see it, the bonus payments and incentive awards are  current incentive to be part of UBS and can not be considered severance in the event of termination w/o cause.   My preference is to be released from the non-compete/non-solicit provisions.  If UBS prefers severance, it should be a total payout of the contract: the existing payments and equity, base salary and anticipated bonus (1% of pro-forma bonus pool). 

- Doesn't Enron need to sign this as well or at least have a side letter that addresses the references to Enron?

-Two people have asked about accelerating the payout date so that the first payment is at closing, the second is 6 months from now and the equity vests at 12 months and then 18 months.  I would like to tell them that no one is getting that - true?

Regards,

Chris

Commodities Futures and Swaps Contracts: Set-Off and Bankruptcy

Standard & Poor's regularly receives inquiries on the treatment of certain =
types of financial contracts, such as commodity swaps and commodity futures=
 contracts, in the event of bankruptcy of one of the parties thereto. These=
 sorts of financial contracts are often used to hedge, or insure against, f=
uture financial liabilities of at least one of the parties. Financial contr=
acts take many forms. Many are executed pursuant to a master agreement, whi=
ch provides for amounts owed from each party to the other to be deducted, o=
r "set-off," so that a single amount will be owed by one party to the other=
. As "risk transfer" mechanisms, financial contracts are an important sourc=
e of market liquidity. Consequently, certain special types of financial con=
tracts have special protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  =20

In general, a bankruptcy filing triggers an "automatic stay" that restrains=
 creditors from taking actions against the debtor or its property. As a res=
ult of the automatic stay, creditors in general cannot exercise contractual=
 remedies, such as the exercise of set-off and close-out rights, without th=
e permission of the bankruptcy court. Because of the importance of financia=
l contracts, however, Congress provided that the liquidity of the swap and =
commodity markets would not be disrupted by the bankruptcy of participants =
by exempting certain qualifying financial contracts from the automatic stay=
. In appropriate cases, therefore, the nonbankrupt party's contractual righ=
t to set off amounts owed to it under a particular financial contract again=
st cash, securities, or other property of the bankrupt party held by or due=
 from the nonbankrupt party is protected notwithstanding the bankruptcy of =
the counterparty.  =20

Business dealings, of course, often result in more complicated issues than =
can be addressed by a straightforward application of black-letter law. The =
following are some of the questions that investors have asked about set-off=
 and netting of liabilities under financial contracts:  =20

Q: What types of financial contract can be set-off or netted?  =20

A: Financial contracts that qualify as protected contracts under the Code c=
an be netted. Financial contracts must fall within certain definitions in t=
he Code to qualify as protected contracts. The Code also requires that such=
 contracts must be between particular types of entities, such as commoditie=
s brokers, financial institutions, stockbrokers, etc., in order for the fin=
ancial contract to be protected under the Code.  =20

Q: In a situation where Party "A" and Party "B" have entered into several d=
ifferent financial contracts with each other, can Party A net its "in the m=
oney" obligations against its "out of the money" obligations if Party B goe=
s bankrupt?  =20

A: With respect to financial contracts that are protected contracts under t=
he Code definitions (and which by their terms permit termination and liquid=
ation), Party A may terminate the contract, liquidate collateral, and net o=
ut any termination values. Pursuant to Code sections 555, 556, 559, and 560=
, these rights are not subject to the automatic stay, and cannot be avoided=
 or otherwise limited under the Code or by the bankruptcy court in a reorga=
nization or a liquidation.  =20

Furthermore, Code section 362, which establishes the automatic stay, create=
s specific exceptions from the stay for set off of mutual claims under comm=
odity contracts and set off of mutual claims under swaps that constitute th=
e set off of a claim against the debtor for a "margin payment" or "settleme=
nt payment". However, the stay does apply to "cross-product" set-offs--swap=
 claims against commodity contracts claims, for example. For cross-product =
set-offs, Code section 553 provides that set-off rights are not affected by=
 bankruptcy but are subject to the automatic stay. Permission from the bank=
ruptcy court, therefore, is necessary before Party B could exercise its con=
tractual set-off rights across different types of financial contracts. Set-=
off, in other words, is not automatic in these circumstances. Although cros=
s-product netting may not be protected from the automatic stay, Party B is =
still treated as a secured creditor to the extent of its set-off rights.  =
=20

Q: In what circumstances could a bankruptcy court rescind a netting of swap=
 or commodities claim?  =20

A: Grounds for contesting set-off may include the failure of a particular f=
inancial contract to qualify as a protected contract under the Code, or the=
 failure of a particular financial contract to permit set-off.  =20

Q: Aside from any netting benefits realized by Party A against Party B, whe=
re does Party A stand with respect to amounts owed to it under the financia=
l contract that have not been realized through set-off?  =20

A: After termination, liquidation, and set-off, Party A will have an unsecu=
red claim against Party B.  =20

Q: Are payments made by a debtor prior to bankruptcy under swaps or commodi=
ty contracts at risk of being clawed back as a preferential transfer or fra=
udulent conveyance?  =20

A: Generally, no. Code section 546 provides that the bankruptcy trustee may=
 not avoid any prepetition margin or settlement payment made by or to a com=
modity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institutio=
n, or securities clearing agency; or any prepetition transfer under a swap =
agreement made by or to a swap participant as a preferential transfer or fr=
audulent conveyance, except where such payments are made with actual intent=
 to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.  =20

Q: In a situation where Party B goes bankrupt and there are financial contr=
acts between Party A and Party B, where Party B is in the money; between Pa=
rty B and Party C where Party C is in the money; and between Party C and Pa=
rty A where Party A is in the money, can Party C set off its payment to Par=
ty A to the extent of its claim against Party B?  =20

A: No. Set-off in bankruptcy is only possible where "mutuality" exists (i.e=
., one party must owe a debt to another party); that other party must owe a=
 debt to the first party. As a result, Party A's claim will belong to the b=
ankruptcy estate of Party B while Party C will be a general creditor of Par=
ty B. No set-off will be permitted in these circumstances.  =20

John and Louise,
 
I have taken John's draft and added a few thoughts, including the issue of what happens if there is not a new agreement with counterparty (the Enron agreement remains in effect), the possibility that the new entity may not hire everyone, and the concept that they transfer to the new entity upon closing.
 
Let me know your thoughts.
 
Michelle

Debbie/Bill - Enron Direct Canada Corp. (EES Canada) has 7 LCs expiring 12/31/01.  In order to continue serving current retail customers under existing contracts and adding new retail customers in Alberta, the security requirements will need to be met.  Enron Direct Canada Corp. has estimated what their requirements will be as of the time the LCs expire, and is outlined in the email below.  The total security requirement comes to approximately $6 million USD.  

The bank we now have the LCs with, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, has notified Enron Corp. Treasury that they will not renew the LCs.  Enron Corp. does not meet the credit requirements to provide a guaranty.  In order to continue to operate under these contracts in Alberta, it looks like our only alternatives at this point are to either provide new LCs or post cash.

At the end of November, we expect we will be requested to provide this security.  Please let us know what additional information you will need to consider this request for security.

At the time that the Enmax LC was put in place, Enmax would only accept Parental Guarantees from Companies with an "A " rating.  To my knowledge they have not lowered the threshold.

Theresa,

With respect to Enmax and credit requirements for a guarantor, there are no specific ratings thresholds in the legal documentation (Enmax' Terms and Conditions).  I will work with Kate to ascertain who in Enmax' credit department knows what these specific ratings thresholds are (if any).  Once done, either Kate or I will advise.

With respect to general processes surrounding holding cash at a Canadian bank, I know that Enron Canada's policy is to not take cash collateral by wire transfer into a bank account.  The primary reason for this policy involves risks associated with our Personal Property Registration System: to perfect a security interest in a wire transfer requires the registration of a financing statement (multi-jurisdictional, cumbersome); even with such registration one is not guaranteed priority. Again, this is Enron Canada's position with respect to cash collateral; I do not know why Enmax would not accept the C$600, but suspect that their reasons may be the same.  As far as the "process" of holding cash at a Canadian bank, I will speak with the relevant operations/credit person (perhaps Lori and/or Cheryl Dawes) and have them contact you.

Please let me know if you need further assistance with respect to this matter.

Derek

Darren et al - I have received and reviewed the info on each company's security requirements faxed to me from Leela and Derek.  What Derek had sent me is the same info that Mark Powell had sent me.  Based on what I have reviewed, the security amount required (approx total US$6,000,000) and acceptable forms of security are outlined below:

ATCO - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$450,000
Guaranty from A rated company
LC
Cash

Enmax (Calgary, Red Deer, Lethbridge) - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$1,850,000, C$75,000, C$65,000
Guaranty from guarantor that meets Enmax's credit requirements (it does not state what their credit requirements are)
LC
Cash

EPCOR - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$1,000,000
Guaranty from BBB+ rated company
Bank guaranty 
LC 
Cash held at Canadian Bank

Town of Ponoka - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$12,000
Guaranty from BBB+ rated company
Bank guaranty 
LC 
Cash held at Canadian Bank

Power Pool of Alberta - estimated security requirement at 12/31/01 is C$6,000,000
Bank guaranty
Letter of guaranty 
LC
Cash deposit drawn on Canadian Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council

Derek - please find out what Enmax's credit requirements are for a guarantor, as well as explain the process of holding cash at a Canadian Bank.  Previously, when we tried to post cash for a C$600 security requirement at Enmax (Calgary), they wouldn't accept it and required a Letter of Credit.  We need verification that posting cash is not a problem and we need to understand the process.  Once we have answers to these questions, we can determine how to proceed.

Thanks, Teresa

Gentlemen and Lady,
 
While I have enjoyed and leanred much from my experience at Enron, the time has come for me to move on to new endeavors.  Effective end of the day on Friday, December 21, 2001, I will be resigning from Enron.
 
I have decided to establish an independent consultancy firm, and I would hope we can work together again in the future. 
 
For the remainder of this week until my resignation date,  I will continue to do my best to wrap-up loose ends and prepare the remaining staff of the Competitive Analysis business unit for possible resumption of business activities.   
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Scott S. Tholan
December 17, 2001

Just to confirm

	Payment through Wed - 11/14 (with interest) = $14,153,688.78
	Payment through Thur - 11/15 (with interest) = $14,155,586.71

The Settlement Agreement is written based on a Wed payment - if they want to argue for another $1,100 in interest, then we can send it to them in pennies.

Can I get a list of the traders that will make up the new reporting list for the new company as we stand today?  We need to get new books set up, and also we need to get the V@R engine ready to go as well.

It is a touching message in the midst of all this bad stuff.  Matt is expressing what almost everyone who has been associated with EnronOnline feels, both those remaining and those who are no longer here: we were all a part of something special, and I think that compounds the loss we all feel.

This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.

A great reflection on you guys too.

? ? ? ? ? 
Tuesday, Dec. 4 
I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
? ? ? ? ?  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee ? ? ? ? ? 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me. 
Matt Hommel,

Here's the updated email after responses from business and legal types:

There have been several media reports this morning regarding the status of our efforts to preserve the value of our North American natural gas and power business.  As we've said, we'd like to form a joint venture with an entity with a strong credit rating so that our trading business can continue to deliver value to our company and our creditors.  We'd like to update you on the timing of the process as we currently see it.

This Wednesday, December 19th, we will ask the Bankruptcy Court to approve bid procedures for potential suitors to follow as they proceed to make offers for a joint venture.  If we are successful, we will ask the judge to set a bid deadline of January 7th, 2002.  At that point, we would review the bids with the Creditors' Committee and, after a process to determine the best offer, we will jointly ask the Bankruptcy Court to approve the winning bid.  Additionally, we will continue to try to close a deal prior to January 7th, which would then be subject to competitive bids form other counterparties.   The number of counterparties interested in a deal continues to grow.

Between now and the bid deadline, we will continue to work with all interested parties and assist them in their respective due diligence processes so that they can make the most informed bids.  Many of our colleagues will be working very hard over the holidays to move this process along and help ensure our efforts to come out of bankruptcy are successful.  Please give them your full cooperation and support.

We are mailing out the termination packages Monday and Tuesday.  The $4500 check (minus appropriate deductions) will be mailed out Monday.

However, the typical process for Towers Perrin to distribute cash balance amounts to former employees does take 60 to 90 days.  We cannot accelerate this process, given the court proceedings.

Kalen/David-

What are the facts surrounding this process? Surely what is outlined below can't be accurate...if it is- we need to figure out what can be done to shorten the timeframe. Please respond directly to Sabra L. Dinari and copy me.

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

Sabra Dinari

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal).  I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes:
 
-- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)
-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules
-- LMP
-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)
-- One Security Coordinator
-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area
-- local planning in Entergy footprint
 
He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.
 
Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later.  Christi

Subject:	Total deal


We have a capesized vessel of 150,000 mt plus or minus ten percent of south African steamcoal that we asbolutely need to ship to keep the business going.  We are delivering the coal to Rotterdam against contracts with our long term German customers and  have a purchase price of 28.50 usd per metric tonne basis 6000 kcal/kg nar and an average sales price of net back equivalent of 2.50 usd per metric tonne profit margin. so the pnl on the deal would be 375,000 usd pnl positive. The vessel is loading approx 20 the December 2001.

Due to credit issues we have agreed the following subject our approval.

pre-pay 300,000 usd to Parent company TotalFina Elf- needs to be paid in the next 1-2 days.
then either pre-pay the full value of the cargo ca 4.272 million usd, or set-up standby letter of credit, both 3 days prior to loading. (i.e. 17th Dec)

This week Peter Abdo and I have met three banks and are working with them to give L/c capacity specifically based around our international coal flows. We have Absa
 bank looking at raising the l/c on this deal specifically and are confident that they will do so, such that the pre-pay on full value will not be required

Please can we get approval for the initial prepay of 300,000 usd in the next 1-2 days. We have in place a total fina elf parent company guarantee for good measure.

thanks in advance

Peter

They best way to manage your day gas problem would be to find counterparties that you are long last day prompt swaps (that are expiring now), and take them off throughout the day.  For example, if a counterparty wants to reduce settlement risk, you can have a futures broker help manage match swaps counterparties and do an offsetting futures position, from which you can get long futures.

this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to
complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial
groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start
the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.
 The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something
we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's
about it on the non-commercial side.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

  For now, please ensure the following 9 individuals are on the RETAIN notice until further notice:
1)  Chris Clark
2)  Angie Wingo
3)  Jason Loup
4)  Junichi Sugiura
5)  Brian Mihura

Thank you for the presentations.  I forwarded your FERC question to Andy
Alter of our Legal Department, since he is handling the licensing issues for
this project.  He will get back to Jim Steffes.

On an unrelated note, what (if any) tech support obligations do you believe
Newco will have to the Bridgeline Holdings and AEP Energy Services joint
ventures?

Given how the audience might interpret this in light of recent events, do we really want to be sending a letter to customers boasting of Enron conducting its affairs in accordance with the "highest ethical standards"?

Attached is a copy of a sample letter which we are sending to selected vendors of Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries as an additional step toward implementing our commitment to conduct our business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business Ethics Policy.

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to an Enron work environment of which we can all be proud.

OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
<<Headquarter_Name>>

Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. ("Enron") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

John and Louise,
 
I have taken John's draft and added a few thoughts, including the issue of what happens if there is not a new agreement with counterparty (the Enron agreement remains in effect), the possibility that the new entity may not hire everyone, and the concept that they transfer to the new entity upon closing.
 
Let me know your thoughts.
 
Michelle

I assume that you have gotten the information regarding proposed bonuses that we discussed.  The list of IT personnel (Development, EOL and Infrstructure) was slow in coming to me.   And once received, when I asked for data from HR on last year's bonus amounts for these people to use as a starting point in the process, it became evident that several persons within HR were on this mission.  Apparently others had been given the same task relative to the IT teams.  Let me know if you did not get what you needed; but it seemed that there were enough hands in this that you should have received the information that you needed -- maybe more than once!  --Sally

I'm unable to reach John Arnold this afternoon.  How important is BNP Paribas to our NYMEX operations?  Do we have replacement brokers that we are willing to rely on?

Lousie,

I would be grateful if you could review the transaction below, which will require your approval.   As outlined below the client 'Borealis'  wishes to change the terms of the contract given our current situation.  RAC is comfortable with the changes, as it will result in a significant saving in storage costs and allow the LPG trader to flatten his book. Further, whilst there maybe the potential of MTM movement between the $180 purchase price from Borealis and the subsequent sale (index related price) back to the counterpart, this will be netted out.  RAC has significant risk appetite for this counterpart, which is a sound credit, rated E5.  The only issue is whether Houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early, which could range between $1,200,000-?1,400,000.  If this is feasible I will recommend that we negotiate a discount of $15 on storage costs (saving $600,000) as opposed to $10.  


Kind rgds,

Nish

Subject:	London - LPG Book





Enron put 40,000 MT of Propane in storage under a term agreement (contract QA 8318)  in a facility 
in Sweden,  managed and owned by a company called Borealis.  Enron, under the contract, agreed 
to pay $45 per MT for the right to utilize the storage.  
Due to Swedish law,  Enron can/could not have title to the product in Sweden and Borealis paid Enron, 
under a pre-agreed price formula,  $186 per M/T.   Upon Enron's sale of the product and subsequent 
lifting a payment of the $186 + $45 (storage fee) would become due to Borealis.  The likely timeframe
for selling the product would be Jan. 2002 as that is the highest OTC swap price mkt which in turn
would mean payment to Borealis would be due on 30 days past B/L. ie early Feb.

Borealis are very concerned about Enron's ability to meet it's payment obligation and has suggested
a transaction that in several ways would suit the LPG book.

Pls let me know if you need further information.

Bo Petersen 

1.	An upfront payment (this week)  of the storage payment with a reduction of 
$10-$15 dollars for the storage fee.  $400,000-$600,000 savings

2.	Borealis would purchase the Product in tank at an indexed related price
which would fit the London LPG book very well

3.	The contractual obligations to lift the storage tons would be further complicated
by the fact that the one physical trader most likely will not be here much longer.


Pls let me know if you need further information.

Bo Petersen

fyi... we can expect a number of calls Friday about our trading levels.  We need to be honest about counterparties and volumes without being alarmist.  I'll be in the office at 8:30 a.m. so will check with both of you in the morning. thx. kd

Karen

There will be a story in tomorrow's Financial Times about our trading position in Europe. Myself and John Sherriff spoke with London-based FT reporter Andy Taylor.

Andy is a long-standing contact and an Enron supporter. He spoke with various players in the European market and although they were supportive, they were also giving the impression that business with Enron had dropped 90%. 

This is not the case and it was therefore important to refute this. I'm comfortable with how the interview went. John made a point of saying how supportive counterparties had been and we did not discuss anything beyond our European trading position.

Will forward the coverage tomorrow.

Hope all is well and that you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving.

Cheers

Alex

This has been on hold for some time now. We need to increase the l/c to keep our foreign primary casualty coverage in place. The total value of the l/c would be $288,700. It is not much of an increase we need, yet there is zero capacity from the bank to handle our request. Failure to act could send a very negative message to the insurance market if we can't handle this small a request.  Just thought you should be made aware.

Please advise the status as this increase needs to be in place no later than November 10, 2001 or it will jeopardize the insurance coverage for Enron's entities operating in foreign countries.

I understand the copr need to hold off on all unneccessary requests for L/C's or funding. We need to be careful not to jeopordize our insurance coverage. The small amout of the L/C coverage increase keeps in place valuable insurance cover. Please confirm with Jim or Paul what the urgency is to ensure we maintain cover. If it needs Global Finace approvale as well, we can askk for it.

We currently are hold with Standard Charter and can not process this request.  I will check with them next week to see where Enron stands.
 
Also, keep in mind, I would need VP approval or above for any changes requested.  Please have someone forward their approval to me on your request.  
 
Thanks,
Jessie

The subject LOC #S9703509 issued to ACE-INA Overseas Insurance Company, Ltd., and ACE American Insurance Company in the amount of $122,500 needs to be increased to indicate a new LOC amount of $288,700. 
 
Please amend accordingly and let me know should you have any questions.
