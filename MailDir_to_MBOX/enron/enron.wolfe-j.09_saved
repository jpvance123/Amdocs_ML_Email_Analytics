Real Jobs for Unreal People
Things to do after the before.
Stanley Bing
Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 EDT 2001
With the collapse of the new economy, a host of formerly employed people  are now formerly employed. Having developed their skills in the nouveau  operating environment, these ex-operators are now roaming the  brick-and-mortar business establishments of the nation and the world,  looking for ways to transfer their digital abilities to analog  assignments. 
Unfortunately, the capabilities that were valued in the halcyon days of  derring-do and flimflammery don't automatically translate to our current  situation. Yet those in the digital diaspora have enormous gifts that  took them to the top of their now defunct professions! Many are young  and good-looking. All they need, as a group, is a little help turning  the things they know into jobs that actually need to be done. As a  public service, then, let's look at some now dysfunctional functions and  how they may be morphed into lucrative gigs in the global here and now. 
Before: Web designer. Back when the Internet was cooking, there  were many, many jobs for people who designed the product. There were  sites dedicated to delivering Chinese food to your house if you wanted  it, free of charge. Others would provide you with information about  classmates you had no use for 20 years ago, free of charge. There were  online phone books, in case you had lost yours. And every site needed  designers to make all the little boxes that said things like OKAY and NO  THANKS. 
After: tattoo artist. Many of the people who were dedicated to  the Internet economy now seem to have tattoos, and need people to design  and draw them. Although this work doesn't pay as much as Web design, its  product lasts longer. Best of all, any stock options you receive are  likely to be worth about as much as those you got in your old job. 
Before: vice president, dot-com sales and marketing. Internet  companies needed more positioning than a heifer in heat. The people in  charge of this process had to know how to take the concept of the new  company, slice it up into tiny pieces, and serve it to advertisers and  consumers. 
After: meat handler. A cow is likewise inedible until it is cut  up into digestible pieces and cooked. It takes only a little study and a  slightly stronger stomach to make the transition to this sector of the  service economy. 
Before: dot-com investment banker. Trillions were raised by jolly  salespeople able to persuade otherwise conservative investors to pony up  vast sums on little more than vapors. Some of the ideas seem rather  foolish now, and the valuations placed on these companies  appear...optimistic? Recently one smart company wrote down investments  that are now worth some $48 billion less than they were a few years ago.  This is a testament to the power that messianic investment bankers  infused into the market. Shall that talent go to waste? 
After: shaman, Pulau Tiga, Malaysia. Not at all. The power of the  shaman lies in the faith he or she is able to produce in the village.  Shamans are looking for folks who believe in them implicitly because of  their ability with words and their impressive makeup and feathers. 
Before: tech sector stockbroker. In many ways, the stockbroker  was the most important player of all, once the initial money had been  raised. For while many who were involved in new-economy enterprises  believed that the product on the screen was their raison d'etre, the  real activity of the average dot-com was selling securities. The fact  that these entities were being merchandised without benefit of business  plan, cash flow, or even, much of the time, common sense only makes the  achievement of these professionals more admirable. 
After: ice salesman, Alaska. Around the globe, people want to buy  stuff simply because it is offered to them. Does anyone really need hot  dogs that plump when you cook them? Sneakers whose heels light up when  you walk? Wine that costs $400 a bottle? A car the size of a hotel room?  Cheese puffs? The genius of our system is that it creates opportunities  for those with the gift for making others part with their money happily,  simply for the pleasure of exercising the right to spend. Nobody is  better prepared to shoulder that burden. 
Before: new-media journalist. None of this would have been  possible without the staunch efforts of the journalist pundits who  prognosticated until they could prognosticate no more. The Internet was  going to replace radio, television, human speech, the microwave, sex,  drugs, and the music business. To date, it has replaced nothing but  itself. 
After: high school cheerleader. They leap! They dance! They know  which team they're on. True, standards for physical attractiveness and  fitness will have to be relaxed when these members of the fourth estate  run onto the playing field, but that's a fair trade for the verve that  they will bring to any assignment. 
Before: president and chief operating officer. This was a big  title. But the wired operating chief mostly had the job of running  around and making sure everybody got what he needed. There was little  glamour. There was a lot of worrying and aggravation as the boss lurched  around in a never-ending game of whack-a-mole trying to beat all the  challenges back with a stick. And it was the prez who was the first to  see that the conceptual emperor was walking around with nothing but his  prospectus in his hand. 
After: fast-food chef. How much more fun will this job be! Food  is something you can touch, smell, and, obviously, taste. No doubt the  pressure at mealtime can get intense, but it's nothing next to the heat  felt when the 30-year-old CFO announced the company was down to its last  $30 million. 
Before: chairman and CEO, big dotcom.com. The chairman, on the  other hand, was about as important to the dot-com nation as Mount  Rushmore is to the governance of the U.S. It's nice that it's there. It  lends to the majesty of everything. Big face? Sure. But function? No. 
After: bathrobe model. They have styles so nice these days that  you can greet visitors in them and they won't know you just woke up.  After a few years at this challenging assignment, you can graduate to  being a management consultant. 
Before: workout specialist. When it was all over, these folks  came in to mop up the broken glass, reblow it, and heave it out there  for another round. The workout job is a painful one but as cleansing and  necessary a part of the process as any other. Now that the workouts are  all but over, however, these gifted specialists are at liberty and  looking for apt employment. 
After: proctologist. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do  it.

This was published Wednesday in the Miami Herald by Leonard Pitts and I think it is worth passing along.
 
It's my job to have something to say. 
They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles the American soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering. 
You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard. 
What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our WorldTradeCenter, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed. 
Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. 
Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. 
Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together. 
Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God. 
Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals. 
IN PAIN 
Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel. Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United Statesand, probably, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before. 
But there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice. 
I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread of the future. 
In the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined. 
THE STEEL IN US 
You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this day, the family's bickering is put on hold. 
As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that we cherish. 
So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know what you just started. 
But you're about to learn.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Harris		713-368-2309
Montgomery	936-539-7843
Waller		979-826-7643
Brazoria	979-864-1320
Fort Bend	281-341-8670
Liberty		936-336-4629

Jason, 
The information you want is available in Northwest Passage. 
Log onto Northwest Passage. 
In Passage select the Noms button and then the Scheduling button, this will bring up a window that has the capacities, nominated and scheduled volumes.

For the throughput capacities, you will need to check Meter in the upper left portion of the window.  Input the dates and the if you leave the throughput point at 0, it will bring up all of the data for the time period selected.  

The select the File, Save As, and the data can be saved as text or Excel. 

Caution, if you select more that one month at a time, it may time out on you or bog down the system. 

If you don't have access to Northwest Passage or have any other questions, please let me know.

Is there an easy way to query the Williams NWPL database for capacity 
and sched volume information 
without doing it day-by-day through Citrix EBB? I am interested in last 
winter's daily information. 
Can you download this and send it as a text or excel file (or files)? 
What options do I have? 
Thanks.

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

Is there an easy way to query the Williams NWPL database for capacity
and sched volume information
without doing it day-by-day through Citrix EBB? I am interested in last
winter's daily information.
Can you download this and send it as a text or excel file (or files)?
What options do I have?

Dear Jason Wolfe,  
You have selected an awesome vehicle but, unfortunately, it is in high demand and very short supply, particularly in that color. We are currently taking deposits of $500 to order your vehicle. Since we are the #1 dealership in the 5-state region, we receive about 20% of all inventory in the region. That means we get more vehicles than any other dealership, and can provide your vehicle in a more timely manner. Please call me if you have any questions or to get on the waiting list for delivery. I look forward to satisfying your car needs.  
Sincerely  
Joyce Mbiu

Mr. Wolfe:  I suspect you saw the definition of TTSL on our web site but I
repeat here:
http://opi/reports/ttsl/index.htm

TTSL is an estimate of the actual loading on the BPA transmission system,
based
on federal and non-federal generation within the BPA control area, and
interchange
and wheeling onto the system. It is unadjusted for temperature or streamflow
conditions. TTSL is a BPA billing determinant.

TTSL is primarily a billing determinant for us and is a rough estimate of
the total load placed on the BPA transmission system based on internal
generation and interchange coming into the system and wheeling going thru
the system.  It is not meant to be comparable or similar to any other load
figure of CAISO or anyone else. It is not part of any
load/resource/generation balance modeling with the BPA system.

Hope that helps...
Thanks for your interest in our operations information.

BPA/TBL Operations Information Coordinator

Is the total transmission load information on your website similar to
the load figures on the CA ISO site?
That is, do they represent total demand on the system, so that when
imports/exports are factored in,
can give a balance of NW generation?

Hello Everyone!

Due to the virus this week, it appears all registries have been reset.  This means the registry update for NomLogic needs to be executed again.  This time it is much easier to do.  On your regular login at www.commoditylogic.com, the select pipeline login page has a sentence in blue at the bottom that says "For Registry File...Click Here".  Open the file and answer ok and yes to the questions, and you are finished!

Thank you for your cooperation!

1.  Logout of the network and log back in or

2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.

Hmm...it seems that while I was being bashed against the Tree, I glimpsed the babe-in-arms, Matthew, suckling in the upper branches,
already crushed beneath the weight of Allan's horse army and his own consistent inability to muster anything
more advanced than trade carts loaded with angry sheep.
M - I would hate to drag you away from your Starbucks "couture pathetique", but the time has come to hang up your raincoat,
put on some pants, and tackle something bigger than a junior high bratling.

How appropriate.  The Byzantines died out when?  Won't Allan play?  Has even the master tired of beating your ragged ass against the tree of knowledge?  Maybe Trav would be willing to play you from home, sort of the way Beth plays you ALL OVER TOWN.  I on the other hand will be far too busy mincing around the River Oaks Starbuck's--it's poser night, and I really must be there; I have so many wealthy people and celebrities to thank for all their generous gifts over the many years.
But, I'll come up to the office and taunt you like only I know how if I can persuade John to do it, too.

Got it.

We will upload those gas daily curves and the index curves from egs-prod
to sitara.  We will copy yesterdays prices into today.

NOTE: I can't find any curves called NGI-SOBDR-PGE
	I assume it is a spelling error because the one
	we have is spelled NGI-SOBDR-PG&E

Question
	how long do you want to keep the prices in the database?
	because We can add a date column so that it will the prices
	everyday.

We are waiting.

I have not heard from you yet so I had picked out the gas dailu curves
from yesterday. Are these the curves you need? This project will take
take several man hours to finish so I need your confirmation ASAP so
that we can start working on it. Otherwise we will not be able to deliver
it to you on time.

select curve_cd, book_type_cd, curve_type_cd, ref_period_dt, curve_amt
 from egs_curves
where effective_dt = trunc(sysdate-1)
and curve_cd like 'GD%'
and book_type_cd = 'D'

This is a reminder of what to do on Friday....

   Arrive by 7:00... Travis will be getting to the track between 7:15 and
   7:30 so everyone needs to be in the room before he gets there.  You'll
   need to have $1 for parking.
   Check in at the Special Admissions Booth under Travis Cherry's Birthday
   Group
   Go up to the Horizon Clubhouse on the 4th floor.  We have the Horizon
   Suite reserved for our group.  Its all the way down the hall on the left
   overlooking the track
   My mom (Cassandra) will be there.  She will have your tip sheets,
   programs, and drink tickets (so don't buy any on your way in!)
   Appetizer type food will be served

Let me know if you have any questions!

We're going to have fun!

Melba, 

I would like to re-phrase this slightly.  "Seller must communicate its election of the interconnect delivery point to Buyer by 10:15 Central Prevailing Time on the business day prior to the Effective Date (the "Election Deadline").  In the event that Seller does not communicate its election to Buyer by the Election Deadline, the interconnect delivery point shall be El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline at PG&E Topock."

Please note - I changed Central Standard Time to Central Prevailing Time to accomodate daylight savings time.

WHO IS OUSMANE BIN LADEN?
by Michel Chossudovsky

Professor of Economics,
University of Ottawa

Centre for Research on Globalisation (CRG) at http:/globalresearch.ca.
The  url of this article

Posted 12 September 2001
A few hours after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and the
Pentagon, the Bush administration concluded without supporting evidence,
that "Ousmane bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organisation were prime suspects".
 CIA Director George Tenet stated that bin Laden has the capacity to plan
"multiple attacks with little or no warning." Secretary of State Colin
Powell called the attacks "an act of war" and President Bush confirmed in
an evening televised address to the Nation that he would "make no
distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who
harbor them". Former CIA Director James Woolsey pointed his finger at
"state sponsorship," implying the complicity of one or more foreign
governments. In the words of former National Security Adviser, Lawrence
Eagleburger, "I think we will show when we get attacked like this, we are
terrible in our strength and in our retribution."
Meanwhile, parroting official statements, the Western media mantra has
approved the launching of "punitive actions" directed against civilian
targets in the Middle East. In the words of William Saffire writing in the
New York Times: "When we reasonably determine our attackers' bases and
camps, we must pulverize them-minimizing but accepting the risk of
collateral damage-and act overtly or covertly to destabilize terror's
national hosts".
The following text outlines the history of Ousmane Bin Laden and the links
of the Islamic "Jihad" to the formulation of US foreign policy during the
Cold War and its aftermath.

*                  *                   *

Prime suspect in the New York and Washington terrorists attacks, branded by
the FBI as an "international terrorist" for his role in the African US
embassy bombings, Saudi born Ousmane bin Laden was recruited during the
Soviet-Afghan war "ironically under the auspices of the CIA, to fight
Soviet invaders". 1
In 1979 "the largest covert operation in the history of the CIA"  was
launched in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in support of
the pro-Communist government of Babrak Kamal.2:
"With the active encouragement of the CIA and Pakistan's ISI [Inter
Services Intelligence], who wanted to turn the Afghan jihad into a global
war waged by all Muslim states against the Soviet Union, some 35,000 Muslim
radicals from 40 Islamic countries joined Afghanistan's fight between 1982
and 1992. Tens of thousands more came to study in Pakistani madrasahs.
Eventually more than 100,000 foreign Muslim radicals were directly
influenced by the Afghan jihad."3
The Islamic "jihad" was supported by the United States and Saudi Arabia
with a significant part of the funding generated from the Golden Crescent
drug trade:
"In March 1985, President Reagan signed National Security Decision
Directive 166,...[which] authorize[d] stepped-up covert military aid to the
mujahideen, and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal: to
defeat Soviet troops in Afghanistan through covert action and encourage a
Soviet withdrawal. The new covert U.S. assistance began with a dramatic
increase in arms supplies-a steady rise to 65,000 tons annually by 1987,
... as well as a "ceaseless stream" of CIA and Pentagon specialists who
traveled to the secret headquarters of Pakistan's ISI on the main road near
Rawalpindi, Pakistan. There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani
intelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels."4
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) using Pakistan's military
Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) played a key role in training the
Mujahideen. In turn, the CIA sponsored guerrilla training was integrated
with the teachings of Islam:
"Predominant themes were that Islam was a complete socio-political
ideology, that holy Islam was being violated by the atheistic Soviet
troops, and that the Islamic people of Afghanistan should reassert their
independence by overthrowing the leftist Afghan regime propped up by
Moscow."5
PAKISTAN'S INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS
Pakistan's ISI was used as a "go-between". The CIA covert support to the
"jihad" operated indirectly through the Pakistani ISI, --i.e. the CIA did
not channel its support directly to the Mujahideen. In other words, for
these covert operations to be "successful", Washington was careful not to
reveal the ultimate objective of the "jihad", which consisted in destroying
the Soviet Union.
In the words of CIA's Milton Beardman "We didn't train Arabs". Yet
according to Abdel Monam Saidali, of the Al-aram Center for Strategic
Studies in Cairo, bin Laden and the "Afghan Arabs" had been imparted "with
very sophisticated types of training that was allowed to them by the CIA" 6
CIA's Beardman confirmed, in this regard, that Ousmane bin Laden was not
aware of the role he was playing on behalf of Washington. In the words of
bin Laden (quoted by Beardman): "neither I, nor my brothers saw evidence of
American help". 7
Motivated by nationalism and religious fervor, the Islamic warriors were
unaware that they were fighting the Soviet Army on behalf of Uncle Sam.
 While there were contacts at the upper levels of the intelligence
hierarchy, Islamic rebel leaders in theatre had no contacts with Washington
or the CIA.
With CIA backing and the funneling of massive amounts of US military aid,
the Pakistani ISI had developed into a "parallel structure wielding
enormous power over all aspects of government". 8 The ISI had a staff
composed of military and intelligence officers, bureaucrats, undercover
agents and informers, estimated at 150,000. 9
Meanwhile, CIA operations had also reinforced the Pakistani military regime
led by General Zia Ul Haq:
""Relations between the CIA and the ISI [Pakistan's military intelligence]
had grown increasingly warm following [General] Zia's ouster of Bhutto and
the advent of the military regime,'... During most of the Afghan war,
Pakistan was more aggressively anti-Soviet than even the United States.
 Soon after the Soviet military invaded Afghanistan in 1980, Zia [ul Haq]
sent his ISI chief to destabilize the Soviet Central Asian states. The CIA
only agreed to this plan in October 1984.... 'the CIA was more cautious
than the Pakistanis.' Both Pakistan and the United States took the line of
deception on Afghanistan with a public posture of negotiating a settlement
while privately agreeing that military escalation was the best course."10
THE GOLDEN CRESCENT DRUG TRIANGLE
The history of the drug trade in Central Asia is intimately related to the
CIA's covert operations. Prior to the Soviet-Afghan war, opium production
in Afghanistan and Pakistan was directed to small regional markets. There
was no local production of heroin. 11 In this regard, Alfred McCoy's study
confirms that within two years of the onslaught of the CIA operation in
Afghanistan, "the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands became the world's top
heroin producer, supplying 60 percent of U.S. demand. In Pakistan, the
heroin-addict population went from near zero in 1979... to 1.2 million by
1985 -- a much steeper rise than in any other nation":12
"CIA assets again controlled this heroin trade. As the Mujahideen
guerrillas seized territory inside Afghanistan, they ordered peasants to
plant opium as a revolutionary tax. Across the border in Pakistan, Afghan
leaders and local syndicates under the protection of Pakistan Intelligence
operated hundreds of heroin laboratories. During this decade of wide-open
drug-dealing, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in Islamabad failed to
instigate major seizures or arrests ... U.S. officials had refused to
investigate charges of heroin dealing by its Afghan allies 'because U.S.
 narcotics policy in Afghanistan has been subordinated to the war against
Soviet influence there.' In 1995, the former CIA director of the Afghan
operation, Charles Cogan, admitted the CIA had indeed sacrificed the drug
war to fight the Cold War. 'Our main mission was to do as much damage as
possible to the Soviets. We didn't really have the resources or the time to
devote to an investigation of the drug trade,'... 'I don't think that we
need to apologize for this. Every situation has its fallout.... There was
fallout in terms of drugs, yes. But the main objective was accomplished.
The Soviets left Afghanistan.'"13
IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR
\In the wake of the Cold War, the Central Asian region is not only
strategic for its extensive oil reserves, it also produces three quarters
of the World's opium representing multibillion dollar revenues to business
syndicates, financial institutions, intelligence agencies and organized
crime. The annual proceeds of the Golden Crescent drug trade (between 100
and 200 billion dollars) represents approximately one third of the
Worldwide annual turnover of narcotics, estimated by the United Nations to
be of the order of $500 billion.14
With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a new surge in opium
production has unfolded. (According to UN estimates, the production of
opium in Afghanistan in 1998-99 -- coinciding with the build up of armed
insurgencies in the former Soviet republics-reached a record high of 4600
metric tons.15 Powerful business syndicates in the former Soviet Union
allied with organized crime are competing for the strategic control over
the heroin routes.
The ISI's extensive intelligence military-network was not dismantled in the
wake of the Cold War. The CIA continued to support the Islamic "jihad" out
of Pakistan. New undercover initiatives were set in motion in Central Asia,
the Caucasus and the Balkans. Pakistan's military and intelligence
apparatus essentially "served as a catalyst for the disintegration of the
Soviet Union and the emergence of six new Muslim republics in Central
Asia." 16.
Meanwhile, Islamic missionaries of the Wahhabi sect from Saudi Arabia had
established themselves in the Muslim republics as well as within the
Russian federation encroaching upon the institutions of the secular State.
 Despite its anti-American ideology, Islamic fundamentalism was largely
serving Washington's strategic interests in the former Soviet Union.
Following the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the civil war in
Afghanistan continued unabated. The Taliban were being supported by the
Pakistani Deobandis and their political party the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam
(JUI). In 1993, JUI entered the government coalition of Prime Minister
Benazzir Bhutto. Ties between JUI, the Army and ISI were established. In
1995, with the downfall of the Hezb-I-Islami Hektmatyar government in
Kabul, the Taliban not only instated a hardline Islamic government, they
also "handed control of training camps in Afghanistan over to JUI
factions..." 17
And the JUI with the support of the Saudi Wahhabi movements played a key
role in recruiting volunteers to fight in the Balkans and the former Soviet
Union.
Jane Defense Weekly confirms in this regard that "half of Taliban manpower
and equipment originate[d] in Pakistan under the ISI" 18 In fact, it would
appear that following the Soviet withdrawal both sides in the Afghan civil
war continued to receive covert support through Pakistan's ISI. 19
In other words, backed by Pakistan's military intelligence (ISI) which in
turn was controlled by the CIA, the Taliban Islamic State was largely
serving American geopolitical interests. The Golden Crescent drug trade was
also being used to finance and equip the Bosnian Muslim Army (starting in
the early 1990s) and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In last few months
there is evidence that Mujahideen mercenaries are fighting in the ranks of
KLA-NLA terrorists in their assaults into Macedonia.
No doubt, this explains why Washington has closed its eyes on the reign of
terror imposed by the Taliban including the blatant derogation of women's
rights, the closing down of schools for girls, the dismissal of women
employees from government offices and the enforcement of "the Sharia laws
of punishment".20
THE WAR IN CHECHNYA
With regard to Chechnya, the main rebel leaders Shamil Basayev and Al
Khattab were trained and indoctrinated in CIA sponsored camps in
Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to Yossef Bodansky, director of the
U.S. Congress's Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, the war
in Chechnya had been planned during a secret summit of HizbAllah
International held in 1996 in Mogadishu, Somalia. 21 The summit, was
attended by Osama bin Laden and high-ranking Iranian and Pakistani
intelligence officers. In this regard, the involvement of Pakistan's ISI in
Chechnya "goes far beyond supplying the Chechens with weapons and
expertise: the ISI and its radical Islamic proxies are actually calling the
shots in this war". 22
Russia's main pipeline route transits through Chechnya and Dagestan.
 Despite Washington's perfunctory condemnation of Islamic terrorism, the
indirect beneficiaries of the Chechen war are the Anglo-American oil
conglomerates which are vying for control over oil resources and pipeline
corridors out of the Caspian Sea basin.
The two main Chechen rebel armies (respectively led by Commander Shamil
Basayev and Emir Khattab) estimated at 35,000 strong were supported by
Pakistan's ISI, which also played a key role in organizing and training the
Chechen rebel army:
"[In 1994] the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence arranged for Basayev
and his trusted lieutenants to undergo intensive Islamic indoctrination and
training in guerrilla warfare in the Khost province of Afghanistan at Amir
Muawia camp, set up in the early 1980s by the CIA and ISI and run by famous
Afghani warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In July 1994, upon graduating from
Amir Muawia, Basayev was transferred to Markaz-i-Dawar camp in Pakistan to
undergo training in advanced guerrilla tactics. In Pakistan, Basayev met
the highest ranking Pakistani military and intelligence officers: Minister
of Defense General Aftab Shahban Mirani, Minister of Interior General
Naserullah Babar, and the head of the ISI branch in charge of supporting
Islamic causes, General Javed Ashraf, (all now retired). High-level
connections soon proved very useful to Basayev.23
Following his training and indoctrination stint, Basayev was assigned to
lead the assault against Russian federal troops in the first Chechen war in
1995. His organization had also developed extensive links to criminal
syndicates in Moscow as well as ties to Albanian organized crime and the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In 1997-98, according to Russia's Federal
Security Service (FSB) "Chechen warlords started buying up real estate in
Kosovo... through several real estate firms registered as a cover in
Yugoslavia" 24
Basayev's organisation has also been involved in a number of rackets
including narcotics, illegal tapping and sabotage of Russia's oil
pipelines, kidnapping, prostitution, trade in counterfeit dollars and the
smuggling of nuclear materials (See Mafia linked to Albania's collapsed
pyramids, 25 Alongside the extensive laundering of drug money, the proceeds
of various illicit activities have been funneled towards the recruitment of
mercenaries and the purchase of weapons.
During his training in Afghanistan, Shamil Basayev linked up with Saudi
born veteran Mujahideen Commander "Al Khattab" who had fought as a
volunteer in Afghanistan. Barely a few months after Basayev's return to
Grozny, Khattab was invited (early 1995) to set up an army base in Chechnya
for the training of Mujahideen fighters. According to the BBC, Khattab's
posting to Chechnya had been "arranged through the Saudi-Arabian based
[International] Islamic Relief Organisation, a militant religious
organisation, funded by mosques and rich individuals which channeled funds
into Chechnya".26
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Since the Cold War era, Washington has consciously supported Ousmane bin
Laden, while at same time placing him on the FBI's "most wanted list" as
the World's foremost terrorist.
While the Mujahideen are busy fighting America's war in the Balkans and the
former Soviet Union, the FBI-operating as a US based Police Force- is
waging a domestic war against terrorism, operating in some respects
independently of the CIA which has-since the Soviet-Afghan war-supported
international terrorism through its covert operations.
In a cruel irony, while the Islamic jihad-featured by the Bush
Adminstration as "a threat to America"-is blamed for the terrorist assaults
on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, these same Islamic
organisations constitute a key instrument of US military-intelligence
operations in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union.
In the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the truth
must prevail to prevent the Bush Adminstration together with its NATO
partners from embarking upon a military adventure which threatens the
future of humanity.

Dear jason.wolfe@enron.com:

Congratulations on your winning bid for eBay item 1624983525, Star Wars CCG CORUSCANT Sealed Booster Box. Your seller, heartie, has informed eBay that your payment hasn't been received yet.

If you have already sent payment or intend to pay soon, please contact heartie at jrmudra@pacbell.net immediately. Simple misunderstandings are often resolved through direct communication.

** Do not reply to this email.  All you need to do is contact your seller.**

If you have been unsuccessful contacting the seller via email, you are welcome to contact them by phone if needed. eBay allows all members involved in a transaction to request each others' contact information, including phone numbers. This feature can be accessed through the following URL:

 http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MemberSearchShow

You and your seller are encouraged to work things out in the next 10 days.  If this situation is resolved during this time, the matter is dropped and you do not need to take any further action.

If, however, your seller is still unsatisfied after this period, you may receive a Non-Paying Bidder (NPB) warning from eBay.  Once you obtain three warnings on your record your account will be suspended indefinitely.

For additional details about eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Policy go to:

http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/npb.html

Please note that eBay does not take the side of the buyer or seller -- understand that we are only trying to help you and your seller trade successfully.  Remember: Your seller is under no obligation to "hold" your item since much time has already passed.

Regards,

eBay Safeharbor Team

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
