Chris,

I got a call this morning from Bill Geist from Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  He is interested in ENA's agency, transport, storage and fuel management agreements.  I told him that we may be looking for a buyer of our Bridgeline inventory.  He was interested.  Call him at 402-758-6195.  He may also be interested in picking up the contracts also.

In the past the following folks have also expressed an interest in storage/inventory in the Gulf Coast.  The numbers are on our contact list.

Cook Inlet
Cinergy
CMS Energy Trading
Dominion
Marathon
Oneok
Sempra
Western Gas Resources
TXU

Be sure to ask them if there is any interest in picking up the storage contract and firm transport agreements.  I would tell them that both are discounted from the maximum tariff rates.

Ruth

I don't have any firm bids but I have the following information.  

In order for Sequent to purchase gas from us they require some sort of legal document showing that Enron has title to the gas.  She won't be able to purchase gas from us until next week.  Their notional bid for gas at the hub is Nymex - $0.03.  

I received Oxy's gisb contract this afternoon and have forwarded it on to legal for review and comments.  I ask for a notional quote this afternoon.  My contact had told me he would have a notional quote this afternoon.  However, he has been in meetings since 2:00.  I will call back tomorrow.  They have inquired if they could by the gas in the ground and manage the transportation agreement so they would have the daily flexibility.  I told them I didn't think that was possible but I would check.  I also told him that we could possibly offer some daily flexibility with a daily deadline.

That's today's news.

Just a few comments on the new letter to Bridgeline:

In Paragraph 2, "reasonable efforts" can often lead to additional disputes when actually administrating the gas deal, such as price arbitrage between Bridgeline's price and the spot gas market prices.  Could we add some flexibility to sell that inventory in-place to a third party so that additional fuel and injection fees will not be deducted from the third party's bid?  Bridgeline waiver to other transport claims could be a problem unless Bridgeline just agrees to cash-out the transport imbalances at the NYMEX - $0.05 price, otherwise they will want us to transport at least the 6,212 Dth of interruptible transport imbalance gas to a delivery point.  How about using the following:

	...ENA will attempt to remove its gas from Bridgeline storage or arrange for an in-ground transfer of the storage inventory during the month of July....Bridgeline agrees to purchase residual gas and cash-out ENA's firm and interruptible transportation imbalances in accordance....

Also in Paragraph 3, instead of confirmation numbers the numbers are actually contract numbers (i.e. used three times).

Call me if there are any questions,

Subject: New Letter to Bridgeline


Attached is a new proposal to Bridgeline unbundling commodity and transportation and providing for a full month of transport reservation charges rather than a unit rate of $0.075/MMBtu.  We have also offered commodity to Brdigeline at five cents under NYMEX for July.  This new proposal is reflective of a conversation with Hugh Connett on Monday 6/11.  We are resisting Bridgeline's claim to an additional month of storage due to the fact that had gas been released in January 2002, ENA would not have needed an additional month of storage for its gas.

Please provide comments ASAP--would like to send this today.

Ed,

The person that you mentioned this morning failed to make it to our meeting .  Not a big deal but, as a result, I want to catch you up with where things are.  

We established that:
(i) it is going to be very difficult to determine a fair market value for the put option;
(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA; 
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF); 
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

Let's visit on this when you get a moment.  Also please help me with item (iv) above.  Finally, I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up.

Stuart

I wanted to get an update on the Bridgeline gas.  Given our last conversation, I am assuming that you have done a deal with Bridgeline to buy the gas.  If not and if you are expecting me to sell the gas for July, then I need to know ASAP.  The window of opportunity to sell gas for July is almost shut.  

I would appreciate an update.

Thanks
Robin

I spoke with Doug Wilkinson who is the Controller over at Bridgeline and he confirmed his volumes on the firm contract (96034592) to be 18,159 due ENA and the IT contract (96034796) to be 6,212 due ENA.  He is in agreement that these balances exists on these contracts and that these volumes are due ENA per their records as of today. I also mentioned to him that I knew where the difference was of the 19 mmbtus that we are off (August 2001, meter 843019).   If I need to do anything else, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Rita,

Do you have a contact over at Bridgeline that you can call and get each of these balances reconciled?  Ideally, ENA and Bridgeline need to have the same numbers.  If we cannot agree, we will have to have Chip resolve the differences when he completes the deal.

Thanks for your help and keep me posted,

Ruth,

With the adjustments made and the discrepancy that I found and will have corrected shortly, I am within 2 mmbtus of Bridegline's number.  My balance for storage contract  96034600 is 1,930,554 mmbtus due ENA.  My balances for contracts 96034592 and 96034796 are 18,178) mmbtus and 6,212 mmbuts, respectively, both due ENA.  The diference in Enron's number and Bridgeline's number on contract 96034592 is 19 mmbuts I believe needs to be corrected on B/L's side.  If you need any supporting documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Rita

Chip,

For the letter, we need to change the first sentence in Item #2 to the sentence given below.  This should cover any storage volume differences discovered during our reconciliation and the 24,390 Dth imbalance gas that is due ENA on the transportation contracts.

2.  Bridgeline purchases from ENA the final reconciled gas inventory stored under ENA's Firm Gas Storage Agreement with Bridgeline, currently estimated at 1,930,552 Dth, and the 24,390 Dth total imbalance gas that Bridgeline Holdings owes ENA under Transportation Agreements #96034592 and #96034796.

We will work with the Bridgeline accounting folks over the next few days to get the final reconciled storage balance.  I will let you know ASAP.

Robin,

I have sent everything to Carol Wilson she should need to create the GISB.  She is getting approval from their legal people this morning, but should be okay since it mirrors the one done with EES late last year.

I told her you would provide her with the ENA information you want.

Will be in touch.  I would think we will be in business later today.

Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi.  The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

John Fitzpatrick asked that I send to you the GISB contract for your review.
If you will complete the information on the right-hand side of the first
page and email back to me I will prepare originals for execution.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

 <<GISB-new.DOC>>

Chip,

This e-mail confirms the info that we talked about this morning:

1)  We found the old interruptible transport contract that is referenced in the firm storage agreement.  It is a maximum rate transport contract that allows discounting of transport rates.  I do not know what the maximum transport rate is for Bridgeline, but it is probably one rate for the entire pipeline.  No active discounts were found in ENA's records.  With the pipeline's cooperation, however, new discounts can be negotiated.
2)  Under ENA's firm storage agreement, you must withdraw it from storage at the Storage Delivery/Redelivery Point which is defined as the interconnect between the storage field and Bridgeline Pipeline System.  This means that some sort of transportation agreement on Bridgeline must be used if ENA does not sell the inventory in place.
3)  Chris is making some preliminary calls to gauge the market interest for purchasing ENA's storage inventory.  So far he has not received much positive feedback.  As we discussed before, using an interruptible transport contract puts the shipper at risk that the gas will show up everyday and be available for sale to third parties.  The price ENA receives from purchasers will most likely be discounted for this IT transport risk.

Good luck with the meeting,
Ruth

I've made a few changes.  I've heard from Greg and OpCo is on-board.

One remaining question is whether we go in offering to pay demand charges for the total 2.5Bcf or only the 1.9+Bcf actually used during this period, given that the gas was trapped.  The ratable amount is approximately $100k lower than the $575k in the letter.  If for no other reason, from a negotiating perspective I believe we should go in with the lower number.  Mark, do you have a view on this?  If our legal analysis is clearly based on demand charges at the maximum volume, we probably should stay with the $575k.

Ruth, Christina said she was scheduling Bridgeline when Bridgeline stopped accepting our noms.  She said some gas did flow for December but she doesn't think there will be any hard evidence of Bridgeline not accepting our noms.

Donna, do you agree with my comment above?  Can you get any documents showing ENA nominating gas on Bridgeline and Bridgeline not accepting those nominations?

Ruth, I want to check to see if you have any thoughts w/r/t my memo this morning.  I would also be interested in knowing what our market alternatives are and the potential discount to NYMEX is associated with those alternatives.

Thanks.

Yes.  The balances will have to be sold at interconnects and not in place.

I spoke with Doug Wilkinson who is the Controller over at Bridgeline and he confirmed his volumes on the firm contract (96034592) to be 18,159 due ENA and the IT contract (96034796) to be 6,212 due ENA.  He is in agreement that these balances exists on these contracts and that these volumes are due ENA per their records as of today. I also mentioned to him that I knew where the difference was of the 19 mmbtus that we are off (August 2001, meter 843019).   If I need to do anything else, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Thanks!

Rita,

Do you have a contact over at Bridgeline that you can call and get each of these balances reconciled?  Ideally, ENA and Bridgeline need to have the same numbers.  If we cannot agree, we will have to have Chip resolve the differences when he completes the deal.

Thanks for your help and keep me posted,
Ruth

Ruth,

With the adjustments made and the discrepancy that I found and will have corrected shortly, I am within 2 mmbtus of Bridegline's number.  My balance for storage contract  96034600 is 1,930,554 mmbtus due ENA.  My balances for contracts 96034592 and 96034796 are 18,178) mmbtus and 6,212 mmbuts, respectively, both due ENA.  The diference in Enron's number and Bridgeline's number on contract 96034592 is 19 mmbuts I believe needs to be corrected on B/L's side.  If you need any supporting documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Rita

Chip,

For the letter, we need to change the first sentence in Item #2 to the sentence given below.  This should cover any storage volume differences discovered during our reconciliation and the 24,390 Dth imbalance gas that is due ENA on the transportation contracts.

2.  Bridgeline purchases from ENA the final reconciled gas inventory stored under ENA's Firm Gas Storage Agreement with Bridgeline, currently estimated at 1,930,552 Dth, and the 24,390 Dth total imbalance gas that Bridgeline Holdings owes ENA under Transportation Agreements #96034592 and #96034796.

We will work with the Bridgeline accounting folks over the next few days to get the final reconciled storage balance.  I will let you know ASAP.

Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 
1.  it is more conservative
2.  the difference is small
3.  that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.

If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.

Chris recommends that we go with Bridgeline's number, as it is much more likely to be accurate at this point.  If Rita Wynne has time and it does not delay your efforts, you could have her attempt to reconcile the balance.

Ed,

The person that you mentioned this morning failed to make it to our meeting .  Not a big deal but, as a result, I want to catch you up with where things are.  

We established that:
(i) it is going to be very difficult to determine a fair market value for the put option;
(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA; 
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF); 
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

Let's visit on this when you get a moment.  Also please help me with item (iv) above.  Finally, I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up.

Robin,

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon.  We have not heard back yet.  We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc.  I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party.  Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations?  I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Thanks again for your help.

Christy

Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi.  The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

Paul Darmitzel called Christy Finelli, our gisb attorney, regarding the gisb agreement that Oxy emailed me.  Christy is out of the office today.  I spoke with her on her cell phone.  She said just before we declared bankruptcy she had negotiated a gisb agreement with Oxy.  She's optimistic that they can get a contract in place quickly.  She would like to wait until Monday to work on it.  I told her that would be OK.  I am assuming that we are not in a position to sell Oxy gas today.  

If necessary I could attempt to make a sale contingent on credit and a executed agreement.

If you want me to attempt to sell gas to Oxy today, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks

Robin

Subject: Today's discussion with Bridgeline


I spoke with Hugh Connett this morning regarding the letter sent to Brdigeline.  His comments are as follows:

1.  Generally, Hugh is adamant that the proposed offer to sell gas to Bridgeline be solely for the gas and not include any discount component for storage and transportation.

2.  He is also firm that we pay for one month of transport and storage to move the gas off-system.  He envisions full service  under the contracts during this period such that all scheduling and other provisions under the contract are followed as in the normal course of business.  The plan would be for us to try to get all of the gas out of storage in month.  To the extent that residual gas remains, Bridgeline may be willing to buy it to avoid triggering another month of services under the contracts.

3.  Hugh wanted clarification on the segregated account.  He wants this concept back in and is not comfortable with any potential lien attachment afforded under Section 7-209 of the Louisiana UCC.

4.  Hugh stuck to the issues related to the movement/sale of gas out and storage and did not attempt to link the removal of the gas to rejection of the contracts.  As stated above, however, he was very clear on separating the commodity price from the cost of service on the system.

5.  He had little to say on withdrawal of the pending motions, but was clear that he wanted to preserve all of his rights.

As pointed out to me by Ruth Concannon, please note that the volumes in today's letter are incorrect and will be corrected in future communication with the company.  I did point this out to Hugh and he confirmed Ruth's storage volume of 1,930,552 Dth.  He was not able to yet confirm the imbalance gas of 24,390 Dth in ENA's favor.  We will be working with Bridgeline over the next few days to finalize the reconciliation.

Conclusion:

1.  Basically, Bridgeline is looking for another $650k or so from us to move the gas out of storage.
2.  Purchase of the gas is another matter and they would be willing to entertain doing so at an attractive price.
3.  They want to preserve all rights relative to any and all claims.
4.  They want a segregated account for proceeds in an amount up to their claim.

Discussion:

1.  To move this along, we need to consider that 40% of the payments made to Bridgeline (e.g. the $607k + the $650k) accrue to ENA in the partnership.  Of the $650k they want, we've basically conceded $145k in our gas pricing structure.  Can we justify more from a commercial perspective to bring this to resolution?  We may be able to.
2.  I need to do more homework with Ed and his team on buyers for gas at the Napoleonville delivery point.  What is a reasonable clearing price to expect at this point?  Can ENA sell the gas in a month?
3.  I need more input from the legal folks on the segregated account matter.
4.  Does the triggering of transport capacity under the contract for the first time since bankruptcy add substance to Bridgeline's claims from a legal perspective?  Can we agree with them otherwise?
5.  Before we consider paying more money, should we consider a turnover action?  Under a turnover, would ENA be responsible for the same storage and transport charges that they are requesting?  If so, we probably should consider this and the potentially adverse consequences to forcing removal of the gas via these means.

I would like to get back to Bridgeline today or tomorrow.  Hugh and Randy will be out for the remainder of the week beginning Wednesday.

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.

At the bottom of the attached file is a list of possible prospects for the Bridgeline gas.  Chris and I are still calling counterparties and updating the spreadsheet.  Thus far there are no firm bids for the gas but several "I'm interested and I will investigate the possibility."   We will keep you updated.

Bridgeline is nominated via EDI from Unify.

According to our scheduled quantity logs, it looks as if a zero volume was nominated to Bridgeline companies after 12/3.   On 12/3, its obvious that ENA originally nominated gas and a zero quantity was confirmed.  On the second cycle, the original on-time nominated volumes were reduced to zero, re-nominated and confirmed as zero.  It would be a logical guess that Bridgeline told us to reduce our noms to zero....   The only way to determine if Bridgeline TOLD us to cut our nom., would be to pull tapes (if Christina had a recorded line)....

According to the Scheduled quantity log, the following was scheduled and confirmed in December 2001 on Bridgeline Gas Distribution, LLC for ENA:
	Commence Date:		12/1 - 12/2
	Terminate Date:			12/1 - 12/2
	Contract:			96034596
	Rec Pt:				0840025
	Del Pt:				0840473
	Volume:			27,500 dth

On 12/3, it looks as if the same volume was originally nominated on time; then the receipt volume was reduced to zero on an intra-day basis; according to the scheduled quantity log, the delivered volume was not cut...this seems a little weird??;  Zero quantity was confirmed for the remainder of December.

For Bridgeline Holdings, LP. :
	Commence Date:		12/1 - 12/3
	Terminate Date:			12/1 - 12/3
	Contract:			96034592
	Rec Pt:				0843019
	Del Pt:				0848704 & 0847719
	Total Volume:			105,950	 dth (12/1);  106,137 dth (12/2);  106,136 dth (12/3)

Zero quantity was confirmed for the remainder of December


For Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC:
	Commence Date:		12/1 - 12/3
	Terminate Date:			12/1 - 12/3
	Contract:  			96034600
	Rec Pt:				----
	Del Pt:				0843060
	Total Volume:			105,950 dth (12/1); 106,137 dth (12/2);   106,136 dth (12/3)

Zero quantity was confirmed for the remainder of December

Ruth, Christina said she was scheduling Bridgeline when Bridgeline stopped accepting our noms.  She said some gas did flow for December but she doesn't think there will be any hard evidence of Bridgeline not accepting our noms.

Donna, do you agree with my comment above?  Can you get any documents showing ENA nominating gas on Bridgeline and Bridgeline not accepting those nominations?

Chip,

Doug Wilkinson, Controller over at Bridgeline, has confirmed that Bridgeline shows the following balances:

Bridgeline Storage	Firm Storage Agreement	1,930,552 Dth	K# 96034600
Bridgeline Holdings	Firm Transport Imbalance	18,159 Dth due ENA	K# 96034592
Bridgeline Holdings	Interruptible Transport Imbalance  6,212 Dth due ENA	K# 96034796

ENA's accounting records have been reconciled to within a total of 21 Dth of these balances.  We need to write off this small volume discrepancy.

Please make the necessary changes to the settlement letter to address these reconciled volumes.

Call me if there are any questions,

Ruth Concannon
713-853-1667

Chip,

For the letter, we need to change the first sentence in Item #2 to the sentence given below.  This should cover any storage volume differences discovered during our reconciliation and the 24,390 Dth imbalance gas that is due ENA on the transportation contracts.

2.  Bridgeline purchases from ENA the final reconciled gas inventory stored under ENA's Firm Gas Storage Agreement with Bridgeline, currently estimated at 1,930,552 Dth, and the 24,390 Dth total imbalance gas that Bridgeline Holdings owes ENA under Transportation Agreements #96034592 and #96034796.

We will work with the Bridgeline accounting folks over the next few days to get the final reconciled storage balance.  I will let you know ASAP.

Ruth

Ed,

The person that you mentioned this morning failed to make it to our meeting .  Not a big deal but, as a result, I want to catch you up with where things are.  

We established that:
(i) it is going to be very difficult to determine a fair market value for the put option;
(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA; 
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF); 
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

Let's visit on this when you get a moment.  Also please help me with item (iv) above.  Finally, I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up.

Stuart

At the bottom of the attached file is a list of possible prospects for the Bridgeline gas.  Chris and I are still calling counterparties and updating the spreadsheet.  Thus far there are no firm bids for the gas but several "I'm interested and I will investigate the possibility."   We will keep you updated.

Robin,

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon.  We have not heard back yet.  We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc.  I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party.  Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations?  I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Thanks again for your help.

Christy

Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi.  The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

FYI.  This is the formal response we received from Bridgeline yesterday.  In the event Bridgeline does not agree to purchase the gas, what delivery point on Bridgeline is best for us to use under FT if we were to bleed out the inventory over 30 days and what price could we get?

We appreciate your support on this.

Thanks.

Attached is a letter from Randy Curry faxed to me yesterday afternoon outlining the initial proposal made by Bridgeline in our meeting yesterday.  Bridgeline is not formally offering to purchase the gas, however, in a subsequent voice mail from Randy, such a purchase is not out of the question.

Additionally, ChevTex has formally requested through Jayne that the accounting information be provided for their review.  I agree with Mark Ellenberg's view that we should not provide this until we have agreement on the commercial deal.  Jayne/Stephen, I would like to hear from you on this.

We need to huddle today to discuss our response to Randy's letter and keep the momentum alive.  Given the LIP meetings this morning, can I suggest 3:00 this morning in ECN2829?

Before then, I may be calling around to get people's views on a response.

Thanks,

Chip

FYI.  HOWEVER, I have just learned that Bridgeline's position may now be NO waiver of claims regarding storage costs after 1/31/02--the waiver will only run to transportation.  My understanding is that this is a bit different from Mark's discussion with Higgins yesterday where a waiver of both, post 1/31/02, was discussed.  Bridgeline has also verbally indicated an interest in hitting our offer at NYMEX - $0.05.

I just received a voice mail from Hugh Connett indicating that a formal response from Bridgeline is forthcoming late today or tomorrow morning.

I'll keep you posted.

Since the "settlement" aspect is basically paying some amount of the
postpetition amounts owed, and reserving the dispute for later
consideration, I do not think that impacts the ordinary course nature of
the sale of the gas.

Nothing is paid to or agreed with Bridgeline until we reach resolution and get approval to proceed.  Have we received these in past months?  What have we done with those?

If it does not create a confirmation, what does it mean to approve this ticket?

Subject:	Bridgeline Invoicing

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.

We are serious, but we can't commit yet--we have to work out issues with B/L.  We think we can work those out over the next week.

Have they indicated any price range of pricing?

Is it your intent to sell the gas to Bridgeline at NYMEX - $0.05 vs any of Oxy's bids?

FYI.  HOWEVER, I have just learned that Bridgeline's position may now be NO waiver of claims regarding storage costs after 1/31/02--the waiver will only run to transportation.  My understanding is that this is a bit different from Mark's discussion with Higgins yesterday where a waiver of both, post 1/31/02, was discussed.  Bridgeline has also verbally indicated an interest in hitting our offer at NYMEX - $0.05.

I just received a voice mail from Hugh Connett indicating that a formal response from Bridgeline is forthcoming late today or tomorrow morning.

I'll keep you posted.

Since the "settlement" aspect is basically paying some amount of the
postpetition amounts owed, and reserving the dispute for later
consideration, I do not think that impacts the ordinary course nature of
the sale of the gas.

Chris and Robin,

Besides the storage inventory, we have two transport imbalances that we also will need to sell.  See the below note.

Thanks,

I spoke with Doug Wilkinson who is the Controller over at Bridgeline and he confirmed his volumes on the firm contract (96034592) to be 18,159 due ENA and the IT contract (96034796) to be 6,212 due ENA.  He is in agreement that these balances exists on these contracts and that these volumes are due ENA per their records as of today. I also mentioned to him that I knew where the difference was of the 19 mmbtus that we are off (August 2001, meter 843019).   If I need to do anything else, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Thanks!

Rita,

Do you have a contact over at Bridgeline that you can call and get each of these balances reconciled?  Ideally, ENA and Bridgeline need to have the same numbers.  If we cannot agree, we will have to have Chip resolve the differences when he completes the deal.

Thanks for your help and keep me posted,
Ruth

Ruth,

With the adjustments made and the discrepancy that I found and will have corrected shortly, I am within 2 mmbtus of Bridegline's number.  My balance for storage contract  96034600 is 1,930,554 mmbtus due ENA.  My balances for contracts 96034592 and 96034796 are 18,178) mmbtus and 6,212 mmbuts, respectively, both due ENA.  The diference in Enron's number and Bridgeline's number on contract 96034592 is 19 mmbuts I believe needs to be corrected on B/L's side.  If you need any supporting documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Rita

Chip,

For the letter, we need to change the first sentence in Item #2 to the sentence given below.  This should cover any storage volume differences discovered during our reconciliation and the 24,390 Dth imbalance gas that is due ENA on the transportation contracts.

2.  Bridgeline purchases from ENA the final reconciled gas inventory stored under ENA's Firm Gas Storage Agreement with Bridgeline, currently estimated at 1,930,552 Dth, and the 24,390 Dth total imbalance gas that Bridgeline Holdings owes ENA under Transportation Agreements #96034592 and #96034796.

We will work with the Bridgeline accounting folks over the next few days to get the final reconciled storage balance.  I will let you know ASAP.

Ruth

Paul Darmitzel called Christy Finelli, our gisb attorney, regarding the gisb agreement that Oxy emailed me.  Christy is out of the office today.  I spoke with her on her cell phone.  She said just before we declared bankruptcy she had negotiated a gisb agreement with Oxy.  She's optimistic that they can get a contract in place quickly.  She would like to wait until Monday to work on it.  I told her that would be OK.  I am assuming that we are not in a position to sell Oxy gas today.  

If necessary I could attempt to make a sale contingent on credit and a executed agreement.

If you want me to attempt to sell gas to Oxy today, please let me know as soon as possible.

Let's get the doc done before we go final.  The doc has to state that the deal is firm and that amounts due ENA are free and clear of all claims.  I would like to make the sales at a fixed price, not index.  If you have any questions, please ask.
