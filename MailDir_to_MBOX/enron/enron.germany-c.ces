The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  7/1 the 
following
day(s) as listed .    There are three worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

To ensure everyone is on the same page. TCO schedulers are still using CES 
accounts, because several agency deals' paperwork has not been signed to give 
Enron the rights to nominate the gas. 

That means that CES can still look at TCO scheduling activities. CES did not 
realize they had this access until recently. Noel Bartlo is in Herndon, and 
is teaching this group how to manage its assets. TCO told me that CES is 
still looking at how we are scheduling our gas. 

BOTTOM LINE.... We need everyone's help to get this paperwork signed and 
processed... so we can stop CES's ability to look at Enron's nominations.

Calp is not listed below, since it is a wholesale deal. If we can get Calp 
processed, we can start using Enron's account. I could eliminate CES's 
account access to Enron and Calp. I would still have access to CES's account 
for the other agency nominations until the paperwork signed. The other agency 
nominations are currently low maintenance.

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some of 
Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature swings 
that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50 split 
with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and overdelivery 
gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved through Jeff Porter, 
the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial holiday" 
for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.


Contract Changes:

7-1: 67693 11558
 67829 5000 (aristech capacity)
Total  16558

Darn it... I tried to hit the 1,125,300, just off slightly. Actuals ended at 
1,121,733. I'm short by 3567 dkt. 

I looked at intraday temperatures on Friday, and it appeared March 31st 
(Friday) was going to be colder. Oh well... hope this is close enough!!

Okay... we are getting into the last week and we are still about 20,000 short 
reaching our total month withdrawal goal of 1,125,300. 

Because Choice burns are backing off significantly, I've matched 100 percent 
Choice burn to storage withdrawal. Joann Collins will baseload 10,000/day 
storage withdrawal to her CES markets starting with 3/24/2000. This will help 
us meet our goal. We will review this daily.

We have reached the last ratchet at 67,371. In yesterday's meeting with TCO 
pipeline, it was confirmed that we should call gas control direct  
304-357-2606, when we true-up choice and the storage withdrawal exceeds the 
67,371. Because of TCO's new stance of enforcing penalties, please write down 
the date, time, and person you talk to at TCO to allow this. 

I also bumped up 3/17's storage withdrawal to better match the end of month 
target. 

Thanks.

Subject: Choice Storage Withdrawal - March 2000

Currently we are on target for March's total goal of 1,125,300 (36,300 x 31 
days). So far we have 1,132,935 scheduled to be withdrawn. As we get into the 
last week, we will teak the numbers to match as close as we can to the 
1,125,300.

Because TCO is enforcing penalties a lot tougher, I want everyone to be aware 
of the storage withdrawal ratchet levels.

As of 3/14, the maximum storage withdrawal equals 87,582 daily. The current 
storage level remaining is 10.5 %

The next ratchet level is below 10% and will probably hit this on 3/16. The 
maximum storage withdrawal will equal 67,371 daily.

That means the schedulers (Joann, Robert, and myself) need to watch these 
levels when we do Choice and especially on the weekends.

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We are trying to schedule this gas for today.  Joann, you are getting 245

$3.75.

Brian, I made need to adjust this price.  It won't be much of an adjustment 
and we can talk about that later.

Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's
pricing.

TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change
Tenn Z6
And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.

I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up 
pricing
to take care of it.

Chris - did you ask Kate who helped with the Bug deal.  Even if they are not 
the ones for CES, at least they could be at the meeting and help us iron out 
the issues we will face here.  Please let me know.

Also, a side note:  we received the proxy schedule from Melissa, but I'm 
curious if you all have discussed the ending balance for March.  Out of 
curiousity, are they withdrawing right now?  Are they near their required 
minimums or well below?   We need to verify all of this so that we know what 
we're working with when we start doing storage for our own account and use.

Subject: CES Storage

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

JoAnn,

Due to the OFO on the BGE system until Friday 01-21-2000, I will need
incremental gas in the amount of 7,000 dth. per day for gas day Wednesday
01-19-2000, Thursday 01-20-2000, and Friday 01-21-2000 a delivered volume of
7,000 dth. each day for a total delivered volume of 21,000 dth.


Kara, if BGE requests call for a reduction for  residential customers  due to
requirements please do not reduce any gas delivered.  We can use this in
addition to the 7,000 dth.also to service our end user customers.   Just let
the gas flow.


Please let me know what K# you will deliver this on.  If you have any 
questions
please give me a call.

Thank You.

Fred

In reconciling with CES I have come across deal numbers 144284, 229286, and 
232373 that have CES as the counterparty but in the terms they show the deal 
is actually with Allied.  CES has paid everything we invoiced them, including 
these three deals, but they have admitted that they are unfamiliar to them.  
I have not said anything to CES yet.  Do we need to change the counterparty 
or what action should we take?

Thank You,

Molly

I talked to Paul Drexelius about this deal today. The reason it was on two 
different tickets at CES,  two different pricing curves were being used. He 
did say the price is wrong on the ticket and the price is wrong on the CES 
deal printout that I gave to Victor. The trader at CES never corrected the 
future months out. in CES system. Not sure if we still need two tickets or 
one ticket at Enron.

I also told Paul and Noel Bartlo that I had to zero out several deal tickets 
and create new ones, because the data dump that Enron received from CES was 
not accurate. Paul and Noel will help check the pricing on all the East Desk 
Tickets. Need Mark Friedman's group to printout a report that CES traders can 
check to ensure the pricing is reflected correctly in Enron's system. We need 
to do this ASAP, before we loose CES trader help.  Can Mark meet with us 
tomorrow to discuss this and get an action plan to ensure the pricing is 
correct? 

Thanks!!!!!

There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you

requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes), the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the

Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would 
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable 
for
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what 
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.

5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on

advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory

Subject: storage clarification & issues

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

The attached file contains CES's first-of-the-month daily volume requirements
for August 2000.  This request is submitted 3 business days prior to NYMEX
close for the month of August.   The file contains volumes to be delivered to
the citygate as well as volumes to be injected into storage consistent with 
the
theoretical storage injection schedule.


Please note that for the month of August '00 CES is not purchasing additional
volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate 
deal,
as was done in June and July.   Also, CES is not ordering any volumes in 
August
for Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) which ceased to be a CES customer at 
the
end of March 2000.


Please call me if you have questions or problems with the attached request.

Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston
than what I requested.  We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that
pool.  We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5
times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very
important that I receive exactly the volume requested.  Please talk with the
shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.

I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.

Day 1, requested 75, received 82
Day 2, requested 97, received 100
day 3, requested 87


For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.

CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500 
dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.  I told Fred 
with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below.  For future 
reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295.  A backup contact at Equitable is 
Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 
12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 
141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to 
FirstEnergy.  

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.  
I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.

Chris,

This has to do with that TENN zone 4 deal that you e-mailed me about this
morning. Like I mentioned earlier, we never scheduled this gas, it was handled
on a back to back basis.

FirstEnergy called to change the contract number for the sale I made to them

If you receive this email before you page me, that's what the page is about.

Attached is a modified version of the Daily Changes spreadsheet you've been 
receiving from Doug Kinney.  The new format shows the required volume by date 
and by meter ... same as before ... but now compares that "new" volume to the 
original FOM volume for each day of the month, as opposed to comparing it to 
the previous days requested volume.  Let me know if you have any thoughts / 
comments about this format.

Again, if you don't want on the distribution ... or know of someone I should 
add ... please let me know.

To date, the only changes for September have been behind AGL, and those 
changes are included on the attachment.

Fred and everyone else on the string of E-mails I received:

OK - since I received numerous copied and forwarded E-mails on this
International Paper issue, I felt it best to copy everyone.  As I understand
what is going on -  CES has an obligation to deliver gas to International 
Paper
through March, 2000.  I agree with Colleen that CES is obligated by the terms
of our agreement to purchase this gas from Enron through March, 2000.  As far
as the Energy Management functions, these duties are not part of the Enron
Retail contract.

The real problem that has arisen with International Paper is that they have
some ill feelings towards Enron for some reason.  We have attempted to smooth
this over but it appears that the gentleman at International Paper has a big
burr in his saddle that I nor anyone at CES can remove.  International Paper
refuses to execute any paperwork required by the pipelines to allow Enron to
nominate gas.  Since this is such a short term deal, I would recommend that a
CES transition employee nominate the gas and work out the logistics with Enron
to get the gas to International Paper and keep them happy.  Whatever CES and
Enron need to do from an accounting standpoint to make sure Enron is made 
whole
can be handled fairly easily I would assume.

As far as business after March, 2000, International Paper has no obligation to
purchase gas from CES.  So if they do not purchase gas from CES, then Enron
will not be affected after March 2000.  If International Paper does execute an
extension to their gas purchase agreement or enter into a new purchase
agreement then we will definitely need to get this agency problem worked out.
Please feel free to call me at 713-693-2552 should any of you have any
questions regarding the foregoing.  Thank you.

Kendrick

Chris--Sheet2 of the attached spreadsheet contains projections of our March

gas needs.   This format was designed by Noel Bartlo, who thought that it 
would
be easier for you and for us to keep track of our day-to-day transactions 
under
our agreement.  (Sheet1 is just a copy of Exhibit 1, I believe.)  The numbers
are final with the following exceptions which we will address with you in the

yours) as it pertains to storage.   The exceptions are noted below:

*LDCs for whom the scheduler is Novsek.  (I need to verify that she included
volume requirements for Major Accounts being retained by CES thru March.)
*COH choice requirements are total daily requirements.  We need to resolve how
this total will break out between flowing gas and storage withdrawals.
*AGL requirements are not included because we also need to resolve some 
storage
issues there.
*In some cases, I see that the schedulers have shown a total monthly volume
requirement in lieu of a set of daily requirements.   We need to discuss how 
we
want to (have to?) handle these under the contract.

If nothing else, you'll be able to give us your opinion of this spreadsheet
format.

The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  08/30 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\Aug_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Jeff (CES) and I just had a nice chat about the Choice program. Jeff 
mentioned the "famous contracts" that should be used for Choice Peaking 
outside the SST. I double checked with Joann and these contracts are being 
used for CES Endusers (C&I customers) as follows:

37956 600 CES EU
61822 4000 CES EU
61825 8000 CES EU
61838 1000 CES EU
61990 2000 CES EU
65402 13400 CES EU (contract total is 20,000)
65418 500 CES STOI
66931 4000 Jeff this is Enron's transport. The Paulding contract went away 
effective 4/1/2000.
67693 1200 CES EU
 Rest  CHOICE
38021 19041 CES EU (note... we are using Dayton, because not enough capacity 
for CES EU)
38021 27,000 STOI


If you want us to use these contracts for Choice, we would have to cut the 
CES EU volumes to 0. This would impact about 40 nominations on TCO side. You 
would have to ask Kara/Heidi/Kim/Donna... how many nom's on their side. 
Because of the labor involved and the general consensus not to cut CES EU 
markets, we have always left these nom's alone. We have found other capacity 
for Choice gas above the SST capacity (54,000 now and 134,000 in the winter). 
There are many different options... and we can discuss them over a conference 
call.

The other item to consider, the Choice program requires us to have some STOW 
to use to balance Choice burns. Currently, I have been doing 50/50 to 60/40 
split (pool/stow). The baseload target is 20,000. Actual STOW for April has 
been 2400 to 42,000 depending on mother nature. This is up for discussion... 
I used to discuss this with Paul and Noel on daily basis. Now, I'm just doing 
it on my own.

Lastly, our target for net STOI is 36,000 a day. We have been calling for 
overinjections, caused by mother nature and choice actuals. My understanding 
is that CES had a different goal for net STOI... we just need this clarified 
and can move forward for the rest of the month. We have typically tried to 
meet the EOM goal, not necessarily a daily goal because of choice actuals 
cause havoc. Therefore, we can get the net STOI back in line... with the 
remainding days.

Hope this covers it.

total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice 
numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes 
are on "Sheet 1".

I believe that is correct.  Of course, ENA will pass through to retail 
appropriate charges for retail transport.

I have confirmed after talking with Jeff Hodge that ENA and EES cannot 
discuss anything regarding the CES retail business.  Both the CA and the 
Retail Agreement have sections that explicity mention that  ENA has to keep 
information confidential.   I talked with Jeff Golden, who is working on the 
EES side and mentioned that there can be no discussions between EES and ENA 
regarding the CES Retail business without first gaining the written consent 
of Nisource/CEG.

Jeff - If I have misstated anything, please let me know.

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.
Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

Subject: January 2000 AGT volumes

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements (REVISED) for  7/1 
the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Subject: Equitrans



I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the
end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper 
is
and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

Subject: Re: CES Transportation Expense  

I have spoken with Rick Ward at CES about this.  We will provide CES with 
copies of any invoices that have pre 1/2000 charges on them.  We will 
pay/take the credit after CES has agreed to the adjustments.  We will then 
bill/pay CES monthly for these adjustments.  If this is inconsistent with any 
agreements between CES and ENA, please let me know.  Otherwise, we will 
continue down this path.  Thanks.

The January invoice from CNG Transmission for CES Transportation Contracts 
includes charges for production months prior to January, 2000.  In total,  
the prior month charges amount to $ 23,868.92.  Per Chris, ENA will pay 
this.  Do you agree?

Thanks,

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  6/30 and  7/1 
the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

Hey Everybody,

NYSEG  1/26

TGP   46 dth for 1/26.  I need this gas even if you have to go out and 
purchase
it.  Thank you.  If you need to forward this email to Chris Germany so that he
may purchase the gas, please do so.  I tried to copy him, but am not sure that
I have his email address correct.

Thanks!



TCO   was 14  now 18.

Thanks!

Subject: market exits


Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000, 
please let me know if this is incorrect.

ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA 
gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The 
TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals 
should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or 
ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.

Comments/questions?

Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.  

Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara.

Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the 
supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.

I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.

Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and

Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

So you are using the current month's capacity times the cumulative theoretical
% to determine the total storage volume to date. In that case, have you
credited CES each month for an overcharge of gas for each previous month? If
you are doing that and plan to for the next 8 months, let me know and I will
adjust my numbers, but that has got to be an accounting nightmare.
I propose each month's volume is THAT months storage capacity times the
percentage. There is no retro adjustment needed plus it is easier to stay
within ratchets. See attached spreadsheet for difference in numbers for EES. (
I am out of town and cannot get into my files, so the capacity numbers are a
bit off, but it explains the concept).
Simply, can you agree on my numbers from below for the sale to NPC? If you 
have
been adjusting each month and want to keep it that way, OK. You will just have
to get the billing straight with Doug. Let me know.

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

Subject: Re: Questions  

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

<mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com> 
Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

Joan--With respect to CES's TCO storage for the COH choice program, please
schedule 48,000 dth/day to be withdrawn for the last 6 days of Februray.  If
necessary, CES will sell back flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the
storage withdrawal at this level.    If TCO imposes some sort of operational
limits that prevent us from pulling this amount, please pull as much as you 
can
up to this amount without violating the limits or otherwise incurring
penalties.


Thanks and please call me if you have questions, comments, etc.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains my notes on selected items on various days.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27.  We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for 
these
types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

FYI--
The Allied Signal deal has been changed to a CES-Retail transaction, for 
which Chris Germany should be verifying all pricing.

The PennFuel deals are entered incorrectly for the remaining term at a TCO 
pool index, but it appears that Steve Gillespie is updating the pricing 
monthly to accurately reflect the correct basis pricing plus variable cost of 
transporation to the gate.

The Boonville pricing has been corrected to reflect NYX plus $.45 instead of 
TCO pool index for the remaining term of the deal.

Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston
than what I requested.  We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that
pool.  We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5
times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very
important that I receive exactly the volume requested.  Please talk with the
shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.

I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.

Day 1, requested 75, received 82
Day 2, requested 97, received 100
day 3, requested 87


For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.

After discussing the CES reconciliation project with commercial, I confirmed 
that manual invoices had been generated for CES business on at least CGAS and 
Atlanta Gas Light (Sonat portion).  Deals initially entered into Sitara on 
the CES acquisition could not be utilized especially on CGAS for invoicing 
purposes.  Thus Unify volumes were not used for these invoices / payments / 
netouts.  P/L reports were instead utilized.  In light of this information, 
there's a good possibility that actual volumes on deliveries, storage 
withdrawals / injections and netouts were not captured accurately in 
Unify/Sitara and so we don't show any receivables out there for CES. 

Our scheduler on CGAS, Joann Collins, has requested archived information from 
CGAS for CES volumes from January - March 2000.  In the interim, as we 
discussed, we should definitely invoice and recieve payment from CES for the 
$$$ they want to pay us.  Afterwards, we'll need to review our historical 
manual invoices and imbalance accounts with CES to see where we actually 
stand .  Any thoughts???  THANKS

Meaning... Joann has a number about 250,000/day given to her by the LDC

Steve--The attached file contains estimates for the upcoming 12-month period 
of
our monthly flowing volume requirements for the NIPSCO Choice program,
including estimated peak-day requirements (part of which come out of
storage).   I am referring to the values in Cols. L,M, and N in the attached.
Can you please give us a price quote for getting these volumes to the NIPSCO
citygate?

Please call me if you have questions.

Thanks.

I need Joann to pull total 25,000 out of storage for 2/25. Joann already has 
15,000 scheduled. I'll schedule 20,000 for choice. We'll be short about 3000, 
but I was over about 5000 on 2/24. We will have to keep watching the numbers, 
but we should be close to making your 48,000 /day target. Thanks for keeping 
us in the loop!!!!

Subject: TCO storage withdawals


I just spoke with Joan regarding the withdrawal and disposition of our TCO
storage gas for the rest of February.  Here is the situation:

*We will continue to target a storage withdrawal of 48,000 dth/day for the 
rest
of Feb., which will likely exceed the COH Choice requirements over this
period.  (The estimated Choice requirement for 2/25 is 19,296 dth.)
*Marianne will be able to draw 7,710 Dth per day of the Storage withdrawal not
needed for Choice to make up her bank balance in CMD 4 Mkt area 25 over the
last 5 days of February.  She will also get an additional 820 dth/day of this
gas over the same period to make up the bank balance in CMD 8-27.
*Kara may need 2000 dth of the 2/25 excess for BGE.  (She or I will call 
Joanie
as soon as we know the need here.)
*Any volumes left over will go to Joann for the other CES enduser Market.

I hope that works for everyone.   In any case, we will review the situation
again tomorrow.

associated with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and for the release from
South Jersey on Transco.  All of these changes are highlighted in blue.  The
following releases have not yet taken place for 1/2000, but should happen on
Monday or Tuesday:

C&I

CNG - Release from Hope for sale to Bayer
CNG - NiMo customers
TCO - Release from Eagle Point for sale to COH customers

This deal is starting to get confusing.... so here is the whole deal 
effective 3/21 to 3/31.

  gulf / leach/coh 22-3

38011/46 8979/8711/8527
51875/25 3657/3548/3473
60599/7  3159/3065/3000
63895/6  3686/3576/3500
63895/8  0/1917/1876  This piece from TCO pool.

No contracts are currently overrun.

Cindy/Kathy/Jesse - we are pulling 19481 from your p20 pool on contract 
63895, which max's out the contract. Any additional Aristech coh 22-3 sale 
will  have to be from TCO pool.

Kara - we are delivering to coh 22-3 as follows:
38011 = 8527
51875 = 3473
60599 = 3000
63895 = 5376

John - I have 550,154 being pulled from p20 for the month. I hope that ties 
to your number. I cannot pull any additional gas from p20, because this would 
overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO 
pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day.

Thank you everyone for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: CES/Aristech deal

I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.  
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
 ---------
 2.8995 CGAS price.



Please let me know if you have any questions.

Chris--Sheet2 of the attached file is the latest version of our gas needs for
March '00.   I have input the daily dth requirements for AGL that I sent you
via an earlier e-mail into the spreadsheet.  The daily totals of flowing gas
and storage withdrawals across the various delivery points into AGL are the
same as what I sent you earlier.

Three other caveats apply:
1-) Some of the numbers that we gave you earlier for some of the other 
programs
may have been updated.
2-) The storage withdrawal that is shown for BG&E's choice program is storage
that we control thru BG&E.  It is not storage that your people will nominate.
3-) As I said earlier, the COH Choice volumes shown as PRIMARY equal
(estimated) total requirements less storage withdrawal, only.  To the extent
that some of the March gas requirement has been previously hedged with you for
physical delivery to the TCO pool per Brian Peronne, we have not deducted 
these
volumes from the total gas requirement.

Please call me if you have questions, problems, etc.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 214
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

ALSO

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mkt
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!

I created these deal tickets to account for the term sells as follows:

145328  Allied Signal for 3405/day from TCO pool
149785  International Paper (Union Camp) for 7158/day from TCO pool

The counterparty names says CES-Columbia-Retail, because there was no 
CES-Allied Signal nor CES-International Paper. Not sure if this matters for 
Enron's system. Also, the pricing and ending term date needs to be verified.

Thanks.

I would like to further clarify our interpretation of what happend on this 
particular deal, just so that all the Enron people understand the 
circumstances leading up to our losing access to these agreements.

Here's my summary/understanding of what happened:  
The transportation contracts for IP/Union Camp were listed on the Exhibit 
between CES and ENA as assets ENA would have rights to through March 2001.  
We had an agreement with CES that if any parties would not sign agency or 
assignment letters on any deals, we would paper the deal through CES, but 
would still have access to the contracts.  We understood that all assets 
listed on the Exhibits were assets CES owned or controlled for the term 
designated on those Exhibits.

Apparently on this particular contract, CES didn't own or control the assets 
for the term--they expected to continue to be the supplier past March 2000, 
when its fuel supply agreement with IP ends.  However, IP adamantly refused 
to allow Enron to step into CES' shoes, and elected to designate a new fuel 
supplier effective April 1.  IP also controls its own transportation 
agreements and those are being assigned by IP to its new supplier effective 
April 1.  Consequently, ENA has no further rights and/or obligations on the 
IP/Union Camp agreements past March 2000.

For Feb and March, we need to go ahead and nominate on CES' behalf, even 
though IP refuses to sign any agency arrangements.  This means we really 
should have a transition employee do this particular nomination--I'll leave 
it up to Joan V. how to manage this.   If you have any questions, please 
advise.

Subject: Re: International Paper/Union Camp - PLEASE READ


Fred and everyone else on the string of E-mails I received:

OK - since I received numerous copied and forwarded E-mails on this
International Paper issue, I felt it best to copy everyone.  As I understand
what is going on -  CES has an obligation to deliver gas to International 
Paper
through March, 2000.  I agree with Colleen that CES is obligated by the terms
of our agreement to purchase this gas from Enron through March, 2000.  As far
as the Energy Management functions, these duties are not part of the Enron
Retail contract.

The real problem that has arisen with International Paper is that they have
some ill feelings towards Enron for some reason.  We have attempted to smooth
this over but it appears that the gentleman at International Paper has a big
burr in his saddle that I nor anyone at CES can remove.  International Paper
refuses to execute any paperwork required by the pipelines to allow Enron to
nominate gas.  Since this is such a short term deal, I would recommend that a
CES transition employee nominate the gas and work out the logistics with Enron
to get the gas to International Paper and keep them happy.  Whatever CES and
Enron need to do from an accounting standpoint to make sure Enron is made 
whole
can be handled fairly easily I would assume.

As far as business after March, 2000, International Paper has no obligation to
purchase gas from CES.  So if they do not purchase gas from CES, then Enron
will not be affected after March 2000.  If International Paper does execute an
extension to their gas purchase agreement or enter into a new purchase
agreement then we will definitely need to get this agency problem worked out.
Please feel free to call me at 713-693-2552 should any of you have any
questions regarding the foregoing.  Thank you.

Kendrick

This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.

mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163
tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837

Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000
Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324

By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal 
ticket is 225366.

Thanks

John, per voicemail. Reduced deliveries to Allied Plant by 90,000 or 
15,000/day, effective 3/24 to 3/29.

39095/124  was = 12809/12426/12163 now = 0  (super nom from mainline pool to 
Allied plant)
37862/14  was = 0    now = 12809/12426 (mainline to leach)

62672/12  was = 3405/3333  now = 507/496 (TCO agg to Allied plant)

Total reduced to Allied Plant:

39095/14  12163 reduction
62672/12  2837  reduction

Total  15,000 reduction

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Small stuff is staggerd Choice Capacity from LDC, no problem. 10,000 and 8,000
packages appear to be winter supplies for C&I. As long as ENA buys monthly
capacity for C&I market that extra Choice capacity can't cover, we should be
OK.

Joann,

Please redirect the following:

from mkt 7-3 cut 9039 dth total off K61822 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

from mkt 7-8 cut 6413 dth total off K65402 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

In addition to the redirects, I am also requesting more gas delivered to 7-1
from you, 13500 dth total, if you could please prorate that through the rest 
of
the month as well.

We can start this on the 12th if that works for you.

Thank you!
Kara

Subject: Spot Deal at COH



Brian, correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is the deal you did with Craig
Taylor.  Is this deal for more than 1 month?

Victor, Joann,  I remember not putting in a deal ticket because I thought it 
was
included in the first of the month numbers and we were going to treat this as 
a
financial deal.  Ask Scott Goodell to put it in.  I can't get into our lovely
Sitara system and hopefully I will be gone before you guys get in today.

Joann, if this gas will not flow on secondary transport from the pool for the
10th and the 11th, call my pager and leave a voicemail.  Also, if there are no
constraints and CES can take this gas over a couple of days (I know this will
not work for 7-5) then do that instead of prorating through the rest of the
month.

Sorry guys!!

Subject:  Spot Deal at COH


On Jan 28th Brian did a spot deal with Chris for a total of 26817 dth to COH 
at
$3.06.  I did not include these volumes in my first of the month numbers
unfortunately so if you could hook me up now that would be much appreciated.
Here's the breakdown by market area:

5-2 1577

7-1 1823

7-5 22717

7-9 700

Please start the deliveries on the 10th.  I don't care how you deliver the
others but for 7-5 please prorate for the rest of the month if possible (1136
dth/day).

Thanks very much,
KD

Ideally, a copy to both people would be best.  If that's too cumbersome, then
send the copies to Charlie and we'll get separate copies to Don.

Hi Chris,

I was hoping you'd be available via email today.  This is a test for now.

If this does get through to you, I want to purchase an additional 300 each for
the Nimo East pool and NIMO West pool.  I need the gas.

The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/25/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The only changes
versus yesterday's transmittal are to NIPSCO and to AGL volumes.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

Subject: CES FOM August 2000 Volume request


The attached file contains CES's first-of-the-month daily volume requirements
for August 2000.  This request is submitted 3 business days prior to NYMEX
close for the month of August.   The file contains volumes to be delivered to
the citygate as well as volumes to be injected into storage consistent with 
the
theoretical storage injection schedule.


Please note that for the month of August '00 CES is not purchasing additional
volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate 
deal,
as was done in June and July.   Also, CES is not ordering any volumes in 
August
for Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) which ceased to be a CES customer at 
the
end of March 2000.


Please call me if you have questions or problems with the attached request.

Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of 
the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really 
capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then 
we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.  
Thanks for the help.

Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Thanks,

Melissa (703-561-6408)

On the Tennessee side this deal was handled as a Back to Back and was 
therefore
not 'scheduled' so I really never dealt with the particulars of this deal.  I
will try and dig up whatever info I can find on this issue.

Currently we are on target for March's total goal of 1,125,300 (36,300 x 31 
days). So far we have 1,132,935 scheduled to be withdrawn. As we get into the 
last week, we will teak the numbers to match as close as we can to the 
1,125,300.

Because TCO is enforcing penalties a lot tougher, I want everyone to be aware 
of the storage withdrawal ratchet levels.

As of 3/14, the maximum storage withdrawal equals 87,582 daily. The current 
storage level remaining is 10.5 %

The next ratchet level is below 10% and will probably hit this on 3/16. The 
maximum storage withdrawal will equal 67,371 daily.

That means the schedulers (Joann, Robert, and myself) need to watch these 
levels when we do Choice and especially on the weekends.

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Attached is the latest version. The retail numbers have been updated. The
transport numbers are currently being cross referenced to the master list John
Hodge has been cleaning up, in order to make sure everything is included. The
pricing was discussed yesterday between an ENA group and myself. I believe a
few minor changes are in order and need to be agreed upon.

Please forward any changes or questions to me. Thanks.

I have revised Exhibit 1 of the retail supply agreement pursuant to our 
meeting
last week. Two changes were made:

 1)  Tennessee Zone 6 premium for 1/2000 was corrected to +.06.
 2) Volume requirements for Choice programs with storage were
reduced in most cases to account for storage gas being withdrawn. These are 
the
final volumes.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  7/11 the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Chris--At this date, CES has a large overhang of storage inventory on AGL.
To address this situation, I have asked David Scott to increase our IBSS
withdrawals to the maximum daily withdrawal quantities for the rest of
February.   Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the
directly assigned storage services for the rest February.    We don't want gas
injected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David will
contact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals.

To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut back
on flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA  per our
contract.


Please call me if you have questions, etc.

Thanks.

Chris has already answered one question--I'll try to answer another.   Here 
is the way the deal works as it relates to storage and intra-day swing 
volumes.
CES-Retail provides us with a first of the month daily sales number and a 
monthly storage number.  The estimated sales numbers are outlined for the 
entire term of the deal in the exhibit--each month, during bid week they must 
provide us with their final number, which must be within 10% plus or minus 
the numbers on the exhibit.  Anything outside of this range is an agreed upon 
price at the time it is proposed.  The monthly storage numbers are provided 
on the proxy schedule--we already have those numbers for the remaining term 
of the agreement--these cannot be modified without mutual agreement.  In a 
given month, however, CES has 5% flexibility on their total monthly volume.

Now, for the daily volume issue.  CES provides us with its nomination by 
10:00 a.m., including the amount of gas it needs from storage.  If they call 
us with a change to this storage number intra-day, then we must make the 
change on their behalf, including buying gas to prevent them from incurring 
overrun charges.  The price of any incremental sales volumes is completely 
negotiable at that time.   If ENA is using any storage capacity for its own 
benefit during this type of situation, and CES' new nomination is still under 
its storage MDQ, but our nomination causes us to exceed the MDQ, then we are 
at risk for any overrun charges.  HOWEVER, if CES never calls with a change 
and their volumes increase significantly, causing overruns (even if ENA is 
using some of the storage capacity), CES is responsible for any overrun costs 
or penalties.

Hopefully this all makes sense--if not, I'll be happy to have a meeting to 
walk through different situations.  Anyway, from a customer service 
perspective, we definitely need to advise CES-Retail each and every time as 
soon as we find out their volumes have changed with no notification to us and 
it causes them some incremental overrun or other charge.

When CES runs out of transport and takes more than their "their first of the 
month" volume on any given day, the price is GD App + $.06 + FT variable 
cost.  This works real well with Scott's $.05 IT discount.   

What I don't know about is the Aristech capacity, does that belong to CES or 
ENA for May?  I apologize upfront if someone has already responded.

Colleen need your help with this one. Choice is having huge temperature 
swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq 
was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that 
are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns 
($0.21/dkt).
Do these charges get passed back to CES?

The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps. 
Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC 
posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps, 
we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas 
day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments 
on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the 
burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the 
contracts.

Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's 
April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with 
CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page.

So far this month:

4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000
4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000
4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals
4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals

Accumulated Estimated Cost

IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940

There was another suggestion to use the Idle transport for Hopewell and Calp. 
At this time, I strongly advise not using the swing transport. If Hopewell 
and Calp come up... it is usually late intraday... and does not give us 
enough time to switch the transport with the CDC's. The penalty for Choice 
gas not showing up is $25/dkt and getting kicked out of the Choice program. 
The CDC's do not accept retro's for Choice gas. Believe me... I have tried 
several times!!!! Usually CES has enough behind the citygate pool gas to help 
balance for minor differences (under 100 dkt). Also, TCO is not as friendly 
as they used to be in doing retro's for Choice gas.

Thank you for your help.

Hi Everybody,

I haven't input my CPA 8 numbers yet, I am still sorting them into market
areas.  I am not sure that my numbers are correct due to production and
wholesale issues.  I am hoping to have a couple of people look over my work,
but so far they have been unavailable when I finally got my numbers together.

I appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience.

Thanks.

Subject: Opt 60 for 2/4

the OPT 60 contract has been restricted again for 2/4.  I spoke with TCO and 
they explained that the notice was posted late (11:15am) due some internal 
issue at TCO.  I normally check the notices early am and then again once 
nominations has be scheduled. 
wges  was=7314 now=0
hopewell was=25500 now=0
cgv1  was=209 now=0

I will need Emporia/Transco to deliver to Hopewell and any markets in oper 1.


thanks

Donna,

Please let me know if you hear of any capacity available for Feb-00 on Tenn
Z6.  If possible, we want to try to buy capacity or delivered gas past our
furthest delivery point on Tenn so you can back-haul your needs.

Just got off of the phone with Enron.   Due to the meter bounce that they are
doing because of the restriction, there will be a  reduction @ the gate (meter
#52) of 370 dth.   Donna, you originally requested 2050 dth, it will now be
1680 dth.   I have been told that you should see the entire 1680 dth.
Unfortunately, you will have to redo your Boston noms.

What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me to 
cut the enduser gas? P

 If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me... is 
to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day to 
avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun 
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need a 
decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!! 

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount 
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. 
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES 
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES 
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to 
cause unnecessary pain.

Since they are pulling out of Major Accounts, not Retail, do we know how much 
of their volume at each location falls under Major Accounts?

Subject: market exits


Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a

Subject: CES Supply Management Agreement

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help.

I created these deal tickets to account for the term sells as follows:

145328         Allied Signal for 3405/day from TCO pool
149785         International Paper (Union Camp) for 7158/day from TCO pool

The counterparty names says CES-Columbia-Retail, because there was no
CES-Allied Signal nor CES-International Paper. Not sure if this matters for
Enron's system. Also, the pricing and ending term date needs to be
verified.

Thanks.

Scott -
We received from Melissa Flewellyn a storage proxy schedule on March 15, as 
required per the contract.  Is Jeff's e-mail indicating that there is a 
change to this document?  I will forward to you separately the memo from 
Melissa showing this schedule.

Subject: Re: SST Storage Injection Contract for Choice - PLEASE READ  

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email...

 as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
 the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it 
wasn't March 15?

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Please read the e-mails below.  I don't have any problem handling this the 
way Tim has suggested, but since you've been working on the storage balance

Doug;

I really don't want to go down the road of putting together any more side 
letter agreements.  They are too time consuming.  I really feel that we 
should have no problem forwarding to you our electronic communications with 
ENA confirming the storage volume.  You can use this as a basis to complete 
your billing reconciliations.  I will promise to forward to you all of the 
volume confirmations that we have with ENA for July 31 injections.

Colleen;
I don't have your view.  If you want to do a side letter, as was completed 
for the hedges, let us know.  However, if you all don't feel strongly about 
this, then I am inclined to carry on as I described above.

Subject: Post-Close Storage Settlement


Tim--With regard to the Post-Close Storage Settlement between NPC and CES, the
situation is that we are waiting on final, correct invoices from ENA showing
the volumes injected for the 4 theoretical storages (TCO, Transco WSS, Transco
ESS, and Sonat CSS).   We would also like ENA to agree in some written format
as to the July 31 volumes in each of these storages, where these volumes
reflect the April 1 starting inventory that was left over from last winter.  
If
these final numbers from ENA agree with the values that Jeff Porter put in the
latest version of the storage exhibit to the purchase agreement, that is
fine.   To the extent that ENA has invoiced CES for a different amount(s), CES
will resolve those differences with ENA.  (We know that there are some
differences, as shown in the attached spreadsheet.)

I have asked Chris Germany at ENA to work with us to get this resolved, and he
has agreed to do so.  However, it might help expedite things if you can weigh
in with Chris or with Colleen Sullivan as well.   Please let me know if you
have questions, etc.  I am going to be out of the office for at least the next
few days, but I will be checking my e-mail and voice messages periodically.

Thanks.

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...


Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount 
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. 
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES 
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES 
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to 
cause unnecessary pain.

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

     As of  March 8, 2000,  the Storage Gas Balance for Contract 530586 was
2,944 dekatherms or 21%  full.

?s (CNGT) Rate Schedule GSS,  Section 8.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 16%, then CNGT?s
obligation to make deliveries from storage shall be reduced by 30%.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Doesn't seem to be a problem allocating the gas.  But please make sure Chris
Germany knows that these two pieces he bought from First Energy are in MCF b/c
they are local production.

I need a specfic nomination group to be identified for the local production.
The local production can not be given to any choice nomination group. This gas
must be local production and not gas from East Ohio.

If I'm reading this correctly, this is for the CES sale to Metro Media.  I 
entered a sale in the system for a volume of 12,120 dth/day (deal 282945).  
The price is IF CGAS + $.0175 + Variable Cost + $.02 demand (if we use ENA 
transport).  Charlie and I can chat about the transport after bid week.

Molly, CES will not include these volumes on the FOM sheet.  I added a 
worksheet in the CES transport file for these volumes.

Please forward this on to anyone else that needs to see it and as always, 
don't hesitate to call if you have questions.

Joann,

Here is the distribution of the CES EU deal that Chris did with Charlie last
week.  The original deal volume was
for 263,580 dth/month. Doug could you please ask Chris if he will keep us 
whole
on the contracted price for
the extra 20,000 dth?

Joann pls call me if you have trouble reading this.  Please note that the
volumes to 8-35 are for TIMET only (k64939).

Thanks,

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   3/31 thru 4/3
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round

OR

$.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.

The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in.

Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278.  
Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per 
day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.

Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They 
should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.

Thanks

Joann,
Apparently the way our contract works, if we have the primary capacity
available I can request gas from you and it will be priced at GDA Columbia
App.  Otherwise we have to price it through Brian/Chris.  Could you please let
me know if we are able to serve these volumes using old CES contracts:

Mkt 5-2  9615 dth total

Mkt 7-1  7600 dth total

Mkt 7-8  321 dth total

Thanks Joann!

We have reached the last ratchet at 67,371. In yesterday's meeting with TCO 
pipeline, it was confirmed that we should call gas control direct  
304-357-2606, when we true-up choice and the storage withdrawal exceeds the 
67,371. Because of TCO's new stance of enforcing penalties, please write down 
the date, time, and person you talk to at TCO to allow this. 

I also bumped up 3/17's storage withdrawal to better match the end of month 
target. 

Thanks.

Subject: Choice Storage Withdrawal - March 2000

Currently we are on target for March's total goal of 1,125,300 (36,300 x 31 
days). So far we have 1,132,935 scheduled to be withdrawn. As we get into the 
last week, we will teak the numbers to match as close as we can to the 
1,125,300.

Because TCO is enforcing penalties a lot tougher, I want everyone to be aware 
of the storage withdrawal ratchet levels.

As of 3/14, the maximum storage withdrawal equals 87,582 daily. The current 
storage level remaining is 10.5 %

The next ratchet level is below 10% and will probably hit this on 3/16. The 
maximum storage withdrawal will equal 67,371 daily.

That means the schedulers (Joann, Robert, and myself) need to watch these 
levels when we do Choice and especially on the weekends.

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Per Jeff Hodge.

Here is an initial draft of an Agreement to finalize the retail issues.  
Please note that I have not included anything on gas buy back yet.  I would 
like to get some confirmation on that issue before drafting.

Otherwise, your thoughts and comments will be appreciated.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.

Hi Joe.  For today the 6th and tomorrow the 7th, I need the volume you are
delivering off TGT K#6057 to go from 1186 dth per day to 386 dth per day.  You
should be able to confirm this with Chris Germany.

CES has been the billing agent on those contracts since their effective
date.  CES continues to be the billing agent today.  Union Camp will have to
write us a letter to change that.

Howdy Folks!!

Hey Joann,

Can you please decrease my nomination to CPA 4-25 starting 4/21?

I am looking to decrease my CES endusers volume by 2,620 dth/day from 4/21 to
4/30 in Op4 Mkt 25.  I am not interested in sending it elsewhere so it will
have to be a sell back.  This will appear in Doug Kinney's next spreadsheet.

Please just let me know which contracts to decrease (38021???)  : )

THANKS!!!

There are still several issues in the CES retail contract that need to be 
resolved as soon as possible.  In order to be productive in our meetings, I 
am sending each of you a copy of the Retail agreements to review before we 
meet with CES (they will be hand delivered).  Please review them, especially 
the schedules and exhibits, so we can finalize all the issues without having 
to go back and check on a bunch of items.

I have set up the first meeting with CES on Friday, January 7th at 11:00 
am--I will let you know the conference room location later.  Please advise 
ASAP if you cannot attend.  Also please review the following list of issues 
to be resolved and let me know by 10:00 am January 6th if you know of any 
others to be added so that I can send CES an agenda.


Issues to be resolved:

Transportation Contract #65403
Verification of Exhibit 1 data--make sure documentation reflects agreed upon 
pricing methodology
Finalize storage proxy schedules and agree on pricing mechanism for 
theoretical versus physical storage injections & withdrawals
Intraday nomination procedures

Pittsburgh vs. Herndon issues

Retail vs Wholesale questions: Beth Steel, Erestec, Allied Signal, CALP, GELP

Nomination issues
 load estimation-specifically AGL
 nomination change deadlines and associated pricing

Process for data exchanges both first of the month and daily.

Thanks for your prompt response.

Guys,  I put a request for your 39569 SIT contract to be entered into 
Unify..Should be available in the morning.  It's Sitara deal number 154700 if 
you want to see it.  It's ok to path SIT for the month towards the end since 
TCO changes it alot   and does retro's for you..I don't think it's that big  
a volume and it should only be pathed once.  Let me know if I can help path 
the CALP exchange tomorrow afternoon.  After that we can bridge back first 20 
days and see what falls out and clean up  (KATHY WILL HELP SHE"S AN EXPERT AT 
CLEANING).....THANKS AND KEEP YOUR CHINS UP!!! 

I'll also start looking at the first of Feb tomorrow as well.  The remaining 
Cove point and Dayton storage volumes have been rolled into February-ratably 
for the month and I'll put an estimated market number in the numbers and roll 
production.  Ya'll may have to help me with the interconnect gas..Robert 
please make sure the ENA portion of it is ok...

SIT that is being used is CES's 39569. Does this need to be created like we 
did CES pools??? Joann and I had waited until the last couple days of the 
month for SIT, because TCO changes it a lot. Is that acceptable at Enron???

Not sure when Calp will be done. Have to leave at 5 pm today. I have been 
swamped with Agency Deals today. Sorry.

path........Just put the SIT inventory contract Enron's is 39607 in the 
source or destination spot depending on which way we are going, put the 
contract from the service list in the middle path section and put the sitara 
deal # for Hopewell on the source or destination section depending again on 
which way we are going....Thaks

Subject: More Efficient Way?????

This buy/sell ticket with Calp takes forever. I've been pathing for 4 hours 
on just one side of it. It's very hard to keep physical flow versus this 
accounting flow straight. If Enron wants it done this way... may need to hire 
a full time pathing person. Can you tell... how unhappy this makes me.

Also... not sure how Hopewell should be done and SIT. I just pathed the 
amount of 4500 baseload, plus the extra gas that was bought about a week ago. 
Reality... the hopewell ticket should be actualized to burn and SIT is used 
to make up the difference. Not sure how Enron wants this done.

Kathy and Victor... will definately need your help in the bridging process 
and clean-up. Have no clue how this is done and not sure how time consuming 
this will be.

TCO said the contraints will still be in place through the week... so most 
our time will be scheduling gas and dealing with cuts. 

Need help with accounting 
process!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 214
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

ALSO

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mkt
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!

Per Chris' memo below, it appears to me the question we need to be asking is 
this:
Was this contract number from CES (columbia gulf k#64502) valued in the 
original deal?  Originally Chris was told that this contract was a volumetric 
FT contract, when in fact it is a 100% demand charge contract.  Since it is a 
deal tied to the Devon production, I don't know how (or if) it was valued by 
us.  Theoretically, we could have taken the difference between the max IT 
rate (which is what we get to deduct from the producers' price) and the 
amount of the demand + variable cost of the FT contract and MTM'd $$$.   Did 
we do this?   If we did, then I believe we have a true up issue with CES.  If 
we did not value anything, then I think we are O.K.   

Please advise.

I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West 
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts 
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric 
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the 
worksheet.

Comments/Questions?

Dana, per the note you printed out and gave me.

CES gave Enron a riskworks data dump which had not been audited for correct 
pricing at CES. As you know GMS was used at CES for scheduling and billing.

This Dayton Deal was not input into Sitara. I created this deal ticket for 
volume/position not for pricing. Somebody on the CES transition team was 
suppose to verify pricing on all Northeast Deals that was input into Sitara. 
Printout of all Sitara deals was given to Phil Glaessner on January 19th. 
Paul Drexelius met with Scott Goodell and Chris Germany on February 8th to 
verify the pricing on these deals. Not sure how far Scott and Chris have 
gotten to correct the pricing on these deals starting with January 2000. 

Don't mean to pass the buck... but please check with Scott and Chris.

The GMS deal numbers are;

s-dp&L-0070 for 5000/day from 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
s-dp&l-0079 for 5000/day from 12/1/99 to 5/1/2000

I'm guessing the correct pricing exists on these GMS deal tickets and someone 
needs to correct the pricing on the Sitara deals.

This is probably not good news... there will be a ton of pricing 
discrepancies until someone ties GMS to Sitara.

I see a deal on our list from CES-Wholesale which includes a deal with CNG 
Field Services with a term of 8/1/99 through 8/1/00 for a monthly volume of 
12,690 MMBtu, at CPA4 at a price of IF TCO Appal + $.12.  So, it appears that 
this deal is ours, not CES-Retail.  Let me know if Brian thinks otherwise.

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG 
Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.  
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell

I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/28   and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are  4 worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs Apr00':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at
each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled
"NOM".   The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much 
gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is
archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to
save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Total Reqs May00':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at
each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled
"NOM".   The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much 
gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The only changes
versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

Jeff, here are my questions and comments:
Section II. A.  Do you think the 2.6 sentence is clear enough--meaning, they 
couldn't take this to mean they have a 10% daily tolerance on their 
nomination, just a 10% monthly nomination.

Section II.B.  4.1--As discussed, we need to add the words "LDC or interstate 
pipeline" after the word applicable in the third to the last line.

Storage section:
Need to add a 5% tolerance to their monthly storage nomination.
Then, we need to add a mechanism to handle their being off from that first of 
the month storage nomination.
The concept should be this:
If they are within 5% of their monthly storage nomination (in the paper pool 
or bank in Ed McMichael's proposal) but not at exactly 100% of the 
nomination, this volume variance will be rolled to another month and the 
proxy schedule amended.  The parties must  mutually agree to the month the 
hedges will roll to (protecting us if we have already rolled some hedges for 
our own benefit), with the financial impact of these hedge changes being 
borne by CES.
If they are outside the 5% monthly nomination, the volume outside the 5% will 
be handled as follows:
If storage takes are less than 95% of the Monthly storage nomination, the 
volume that falls in this category will be sold to ENA at the lower of (i) 
the average of the five lowest current month prices as published in Gas Daily 
for the applicable location; or (ii) the following month's Inside FERC or NGI 
monthly index, as applicable, minus $.01.  If storage takes are greater than 
105% of the Monthly storage nomination, that volume will be purchased by CES 
at the greater of (i) the average of the five highest current month prices as 
published in Gas Daily for the applicable location; or (ii) the following 
month's Inside FERC or NGI monthly index, as applicable, plus $.01, plus any 
applicable transportation and storage injection or withdrawal costs.  

I have not proposed this exact process to Melissa yet, but I have left her a 
message that I want to discuss this.   I'll let you know how that goes, but I 
think this is a reasonable concept.  The only question is....will she think 
so?

  Per Jeff Hodge.

Here is an initial draft of an Agreement to finalize the retail issues.  
Please note that I have not included anything on gas buy back yet.  I would 
like to get some confirmation on that issue before drafting.

Otherwise, your thoughts and comments will be appreciated.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.

Chris Germany is responsible for all the retail volume. I was only given 
Dayton STORAGE positions to book. If there are other dayton positions I do 
not have them.

HELP!!

Kathy just received these retail volumes from CES for a number of pipes.
The Texas gas deals at the end of this email are nowhere in sitara.  Are 
these deals suppose to be entered by Chris since they are "retail" or is the 
Dayton Power and Light deal suppose to be entered by you guys under that 
Desk?  Are you guys done entering the Dayton Desk deals??

Thanks
Trish

I just received this memo from Phil at CES.  It appears to be from their 
retail group in Pittsburgh.  I'm looking into this, but from what I'm hearing 
we are supplying this gas to the retail group and need to make sure that it 
is scheduled.  Please check on these immediatly since the LDC deadlines start 
today.

Is this note to Brian below incremental gas????????

Meaning... Joann has a number about 250,000/day given to her by the LDC 
Schedulers. This includes daily volume:

Who    Volume  Sitara Deal Ticket
CES Endusers    93689  143336
Choice    107489  148416 
South Jersey   36900  142776
Penn Fuel   5000  151759
Hopewell   4500  139679
Texaco    255  136502
Engage   1966  142656
Florida Power and Light  152  151788

Total    249,951

Is there a way to put all incremental gas on one deal ticket??? It would make 
our pathing life a lot easier too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

The attached file contains our daily citygate volume requirements for   3/30
and 3/31         .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's
date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.    The AGL volumes in this file are not
up-to-date, so they should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

There is a 280/day sell that has been taken out of CES 39999 pool on Southern 
Public's K#'s for January. If I remember correctly, this has happened over 
the past few months. This deal ticket never made it in Enron's System, so I 
created a ticket 149375 (Enron's deal ticket #).

Enron's deal confirmation team says this deal does not exist and there is a 
CES person on this team. 

Pease give us the GMS deal number,and if you know the riskworks deal number. 
If you have a copy of the deal ticket fax it to me at 713-646-2102.

Thanks.

sorry, got Aug mixed up with Sep. Should be 786,579 dth for the month of Sep,
or 26,219.3/day. Chris, since it doesn't round evenly to a daily number, 
please
credit us for the monthly volume. That is why we were off by 26 dth ending
July.

Chris;
The 23,060/day volume is an annual imbalance true-up that we needed to buy 
from
CES and take physically.  We are not geared to market yet, so I baseloaded 
with
Dick.

Chris;
Have you received an answer on the the COH injection?  Jeff, please follow up.

Some questions about the 1st.

Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are
showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461
dt/day.

This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce 
the
citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?

Subject: Questions about CES Capacity

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
 Originally CES'.  Assigned to ENA.
 19-26 3
 19-27 23
 19-32 4 
 19E (19-25) 34
 Rec-Leach 64

2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
on
this K.

I'm a bad person.  I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the 
pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775

Also, I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st, deal 
217854.  This gas is for Atistech.  I assume we schedule that.

Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been 
scheduled.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS 
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these 
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged.

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn 
from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get 
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just 
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

Thanks.

We have end-users that get some type of discount for using Pennsylvania
production gas.  We usually supply these endusers with CNR (TETCO M2) gas or
Finnefrock (CNG N PT).  Finnefrock has been constrained (PL-l) so we have been
using CNR gas to supply them.

I'll be in this afternoon, so we can talk further if needed.

The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and 
the
deliveries are on a secondary basis.  The deal number is 322199 and I added 
the
meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.  Robert, Joann, the volumes

not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from all other deals.

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.
Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial
holiday" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.


Contract Changes:

7-1: 67693     11558
     67829     5000 (aristech capacity)
Total          16558

7-5  67693     9693
     67829     3527 (aristech capacity)
Total          13220

Chrissy,  This is Cove Point gas we use to cover CES retail sales on TCO.  
The price was not entered in the separate meter entry for COVE POINT for that 
deal #143336.  So I entered the CGAS APPAL.IF.MI + 0.0841 price to cover 
those sales to CES. FYI.. It's the same price we have for all the other 
retail sales to CES on TCO on that ticket.   If it is different then change 
it.  THANKS

Hey Buddy, get Scott Hendrickson to pull this up.  If it's Cove Point gas, 
then Scott, Robin, and Kate will need to figure it out.

Chris,

Just wanted to verify a portion of sitara # 143336 (Sale to Columbia Energy 
Services Corp.).

At the point, "Loudoun - CGAS/CVPT Loudoun", volumes are coming through Unify 
@ $0 and Econ is flashing volumes @ $ .0001. I just wanted to make certain 
that the economics  pricing is correct since all other parts of the deal are 
at  an Index + .0841.

Please call or e-mail your response. 

Thanks for your help.

We only took 80% of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery,
or not. We have advised any new buyer of the options and are keeping them
informed if we are forced to make a move, as in the case of the 15,000 of
capacity on TCO. We are being conservative and keeping everyone informed.

How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys
looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this
option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my
guess)?

Yes, we can adjust by 10/15. If we add, must pay retro to 4/1 and if
reduce, we
may not get any $ back.

For January 2000 for a couple of weekends SJersey tried to do intradays.  Due 
to the interconnect and other supply we were not able to change their 
nominations.  South Jersey have always been told that changing nomination on 
the weekend would be on best available.  Julie Punches from Sjersey due to 
her changes on the weekend is over at some of her CDC markets is asking to 
allocate the excess gas to CES agg pools.  
Would this be something Enron would do???

Chris,

We have been shorted by Beldon & Blake, 6400 dths of production gas so far for
February at National Fuel Gas.  My understanding is that they had a problem
with the pipeline interconnection and could not deliver.  Enron currently 
holds
the contract with Beldon & Blake for the production.  Unless they are under a
force majuere, they should be delivering this gas.  Please let me know whether
or not we will be able to make up this gas for the month.


Per our conversation, we are also receiving local production gas behind NYSEG
and CPA.  On CPA we receive gas from Power Gas, Phillips, CNG Field Services,
and Stat Oil.

Thanks,

Brian

I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??

The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/23/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The most 
substantive
change is an approximate 1400 dth/day reduction in our daily delivery to WGL
off TCO.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

I have revised Exhibit 1 of the retail supply agreement pursuant to our 
meeting
last week. Two changes were made:

 1)  Tennessee Zone 6 premium for 1/2000 was corrected to +.06.
 2) Volume requirements for Choice programs with storage were
reduced in most cases to account for storage gas being withdrawn. These are 
the
final volumes.

Lilco released the Transco Capacity to CES for June.  We still have not 
executed
the capacity.  The volume is 84 dth (offer #19858) and you don't get billed a
demand charge from the pipeline.  I believe Lilco bills CES directly for
participating in the program.

Do you want to execute this capacity?

thanks

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help.

not
aware of the MLI as I did not anticipate working from home I did not bring my
chart with me.  Please look it up.      NYSEG Op 2 Mkt 21  - the mli will be
listed if you look up NYSEG in Op 2 Mkt 21.
Joann could help you with this if you all don't have access to this

Hey guys,

Just wanted to confirm that that NIMO gas 300 East Meter and actually just 214
to the West Meter was purchased through the EOM.

At NYSEG, I need to purchase TCO  300dth/day from 1/27 to 1/31 to send to Mkt
21.  I believe that it is Op 2, Mkt 21, please check with Joann Collins to
double check that Op area, I don't have my chart with me.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks!

Subject: storage clarification & issues


Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

Just got this clarified by Scott G., that this is not a special pricing but
like any other contract. ENA will bill CES for both demand and commodity
charges, ENA is billed by TCO for $0.01 demand and commodity and Aristech pays
TCO the remaining demand.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial
holiday" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.

There is a later one also than came back undeliverable and I resent which I
will forward.   And also per Brian we needed it through the end of month
also.

It does get confusing.   There are numbers flying around from everywhere.   I
guess there is nothing you can do today.   I really need this through the end
of month.   There are huge penalties involved here.

I have spoken with Rick Ward at CES about this.  We will provide CES with 
copies of any invoices that have pre 1/2000 charges on them.  We will 
pay/take the credit after CES has agreed to the adjustments.  We will then 
bill/pay CES monthly for these adjustments.  If this is inconsistent with any 
agreements between CES and ENA, please let me know.  Otherwise, we will 
continue down this path.  Thanks.

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

"Moths"

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you
naked?" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you."

"Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

"Who the fuck are you?" the man asks

"I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with."

The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

"Those little bastards!"

Donna,

Please let me know if you hear of any capacity available for Feb-00 on Tenn
Z6.  If possible, we want to try to buy capacity or delivered gas past our
furthest delivery point on Tenn so you can back-haul your needs.

Just got off of the phone with Enron.   Due to the meter bounce that they are
doing because of the restriction, there will be a  reduction @ the gate (meter
#52) of 370 dth.   Donna, you originally requested 2050 dth, it will now be
1680 dth.   I have been told that you should see the entire 1680 dth.
Unfortunately, you will have to redo your Boston noms.

Subject: Cut Gas 1/26


I just found out through COH reports that 500 dth delivered to mkt 5-7 via
K38094 (First Energy) did not show up on the 26th of January.

As a result of this and other factors, a total delivery volume to that agg 
pool
went from the 484 dth requested amount to 217 dth.  This was during the OFO
period.  Not sure how we are going to handle the resulting penalties, but just
wanted to make sure that Enron does not pay First Energy for those volumes.
Sorry I was not notified of this cut sooner.

Please let me know if ?s

Brian, correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is the deal you did with 
Craig Taylor.  Is this deal for more than 1 month?

Victor, Joann,  I remember not putting in a deal ticket because I thought it 
was included in the first of the month numbers and we were going to treat 
this as a financial deal.  Ask Scott Goodell to put it in.  I can't get into 
our lovely Sitara system and hopefully I will be gone before you guys get in 
today.

Joann, if this gas will not flow on secondary transport from the pool for the 
10th and the 11th, call my pager and leave a voicemail.  Also, if there are 
no constraints and CES can take this gas over a couple of days (I know this 
will not work for 7-5) then do that instead of prorating through the rest of 
the month.

Sorry guys!!

On Jan 28th Brian did a spot deal with Chris for a total of 26817 dth to COH 
at
$3.06.  I did not include these volumes in my first of the month numbers
unfortunately so if you could hook me up now that would be much appreciated.
Here's the breakdown by market area:

5-2 1577

7-1 1823

7-5 22717

7-9 700

Please start the deliveries on the 10th.  I don't care how you deliver the
others but for 7-5 please prorate for the rest of the month if possible (1136
dth/day).

Thanks very much,
KD

Subject: Re: COH Storage Withdrawals


Okay.... to ensure we are all on the same page. We will try to hit your
48,000/day for the last 6 days. The nom's were redone for 2/24.

Because choice burns are so low... I'll nominate about 33,000/day of the
choice burn directly from storage. Joann Collins will use about 15,000/day
to other CES Enduser Market. Just remember, we are at the mercy of mother
nature. When the actuals arrive.... we balance off storage. So if it gets
colder than the forecast, the storage withdrawal will increase. If it gets
warmer, the storage withdrawal will decrease.

If for some reason you want to change this 48,000/day target... just let me
know by 10 EST. This will allow enough time to switch the nom's.

Dick Jenkins and Chris Germany will review if they want "CES to sell back
flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the storage withdrawal at this
level." (quoted from your other e-mail).

Do you know your March target number for storage withdrawal??? I can
provide your storage balance if needed. Remember, that operationally.... I
use the storage to keep your choice burn balanced with choice actuals.

Thank you!!!!

Joan--I got your voicemail regarding the current daily requirement for COH
Choice.   I understand that you won't be able to pull the 48,000 dth/day
from
storage if the load requirement is below that level.   I anticipate that we
may
be in that situation for at least the next few days, and I will check with
Kara
regarding the burn levels in the future.   We'll figure out day by day how
much
we want to pull and we'll get that to you prior to your 10am EST nom

Colleen need your help with this one. Choice is having huge temperature 
swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq 
was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that 
are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns 
($0.21/dkt).
Do these charges get passed back to CES?

The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps. 
Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC 
posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps, 
we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas 
day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments 
on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the 
burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the 
contracts.

Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's 
April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with 
CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page.

So far this month:

4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000
4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000
4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals
4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals

Accumulated Estimated Cost

IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940

There was another suggestion to use the Idle transport for Hopewell and Calp. 
At this time, I strongly advise not using the swing transport. If Hopewell 
and Calp come up... it is usually late intraday... and does not give us 
enough time to switch the transport with the CDC's. The penalty for Choice 
gas not showing up is $25/dkt and getting kicked out of the Choice program. 
The CDC's do not accept retro's for Choice gas. Believe me... I have tried 
several times!!!! Usually CES has enough behind the citygate pool gas to help 
balance for minor differences (under 100 dkt). Also, TCO is not as friendly 
as they used to be in doing retro's for Choice gas.

Thank you for your help.

Can you believe it... I was wrong.

Hans Rotman (Fuel Manager at CES, left in 12/99), did a deal with Aristech 
last Sept/Oct for Aristech to release the excess capacity to CES in April and 
May. John Whited (Fuel Manager at CES, still there) thinks it was release in 
CES's name. Like Chris said, we really don't need the capacity. We are short 
Hopewell capacity in Market Area 33 on the East Side. This capcity is on the 
West Side in Kentucky.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.  
This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this 
capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  

I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the 
space if we don't have to.

Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management 
group.

Tco uses a master agreement for the storage's (Contract 51407) and then list
the individual agreements to allocate costs.  Contract 51407 acts as a
balancing agreement to tell you what is available.  There will never be 
charges
on 51497 they will always be on the individual contracts.

I understand that contract 63304 is the retail FSS contract with a total
capacity of 7,503,838.  I bill CES Retail for the demand charges on this.  
What
is FSS contract 51407?

I talked with Chris G a little while ago---Two important items to note:

* He will be working on the rest of the CES business on Saturday and should 
be ready for us to bill out on Monday.

* On the manual invoice that was sent this past week.... CGAS was actually 
netted (the net of Sales and Purchase for this pipe only) so we need to find 
out what the real sales and purchase prices are when it's time to fix it in 
Unify (Chris, this one's a heads up for you when we see you for clean ups).

Ok....c'est tout.

confirm that the capacity will be recalled from ENA and reput to Metromedia 
for July?  Last week Boston said the paperwork from both parties was not

Scott--The volumes delivered into Central Hudson off Iroquois for Arma 
Textiles
was included in Exhibit 1 of the 12/99 Energy Purchase Agreement such that it
would appear that Enron would be supplying this gas to CES.   However, the gas
to supply Arma was already purchased from Duke Energy, and as far as I can
tell, Enron has had nothing to do with delivering this gas, and Duke Energy 
has
billed us directly for the gas that they supply each month.

I discussed this with Chris Germany, and we agreed that CES would just deal
directly with Duke Energy on this and leave Enron out of it.    Accordingly, 
if
you look at the May'00 first-of-the-month request that I sent to Enron on 
April
24, the table does show 135 dth/day into Central Hudson off Iroquois.  
However,
the table notes that this gas is being supplied by Duke Energy and therefore 
no
volumes are being requested from Enron.

Please let me know if this needs further action or clarification.

Thanks.

Enron is probably not familiar with the deal as they did not have to make
any
nominations.  Although, the deal was documented each month on the memos and
spreadsheets that were sent to Enron.  I do not have a contact at Duke.  It
was
my understanding that both parties (Duke and Arma) knew the deal was a

quantity.

When I was assigned Central Hudson in January I was told that there was one
customer behind the gate and that was Arma Textiles.  Arma was backed 100%
by a
Duke purchase that subseqently went with the Enron sale.  I was informed by
the
previous scheduler that all CES did was to make the nomination based on GMS
at
bidweek.   It was a stand alone deal that CES nominated based on GMS.

Kim,

 I am in the process of assigning this customer to a new marketer. A
review of the file shows a recent correspondence concerning tariff gas
purchased by Arma between Kurt Marburger & Charlie Dalphon. Are you able to
shed any light on the issue? There is a significant outstanding balance and
I
believe the customer has made the decision to stop payment until credits
are
issued for the tariff charges.

 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been 
scheduled.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS 
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these 
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged.

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn 
from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get 
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just 
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

Thanks.

Okay.... to ensure we are all on the same page. We will try to hit your 
48,000/day for the last 6 days. The nom's were redone for 2/24.

Because choice burns are so low... I'll nominate about 33,000/day of the 
choice burn directly from storage. Joann Collins will use about 15,000/day to 
other CES Enduser Market. Just remember, we are at the mercy of mother 
nature. When the actuals arrive.... we balance off storage. So if it gets 
colder than the forecast, the storage withdrawal will increase. If it gets 
warmer, the storage withdrawal will decrease. 

If for some reason you want to change this 48,000/day target... just let me 
know by 10 EST. This will allow enough time to switch the nom's.

Dick Jenkins and Chris Germany will review if they want "CES to sell back 
flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the storage withdrawal at this 
level." (quoted from your other e-mail).

Do you know your March target number for storage withdrawal??? I can provide 
your storage balance if needed. Remember, that operationally.... I use the 
storage to keep your choice burn balanced with choice actuals.

Thank you!!!!

Joan--I got your voicemail regarding the current daily requirement for COH
Choice.   I understand that you won't be able to pull the 48,000 dth/day from
storage if the load requirement is below that level.   I anticipate that we 
may
be in that situation for at least the next few days, and I will check with 
Kara
regarding the burn levels in the future.   We'll figure out day by day how 
much
we want to pull and we'll get that to you prior to your 10am EST nom
deadline.     Don't redo your nom for 2/24; just leave it as is.

Thanks.

Okay... to ensure we are all on the same page. I've talked to Jill 
Linkenauger and Heidi Griffith... and the following will be done.

Jill has forwarded to Heidi the CNR file for CES customers and their 
addresses. Jill also forwarded the appropriate form that needs to be sent to 
the producers, signed, and return to Enron.

Terry Franklin will be the Enron North America contact on the form for these 
CNR producers (Jill estimates about 50 CES producers). 

Later this week, Heidi will send the form to the CNR's CES customers. Heidi 
will put Terry's phone number and address on the form.

We will need the Appalachian Traders (John Singer, Jim Javins, Jill 
Linkenauger) to encourage the producers to sign this paper work and get it 
back to Enron ASAP. We want the change over done by April estimates.

Jill said if the change did not happen in time for April estimates, she would 
help send out the ascii file one more time. At the end of March, Jill will 
end her employment with CES... so we can't depend on her in the future months 
for this ascii file.

Thanks again for everyone's help in getting the change over done ASAP.

Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    I know you wanted
an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 
markets
until Thursday as Boston Gas and S. Ct. Algorithms will be available then.   I
have estimates in on those gates.  We will need a range from 2700 dth to 3600
dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to
weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

Chris--So as not to delay things more than I already have, the table below
shows our March '00 Requirements on AGL by pipeline.  I will put these values
into the spreadsheet that I sent earlier, but this will give you an idea of
what the numbers look like.



The above values for storage withdrawals assume that we are maximizing the
withdrawals from the so-called "Directly Assigned Storage" that ENA schedules
on our behalf.  I believe that notwithstanding the above storage withdrawal
values, we will still have storage inventory left at the end of March since 
our
withdrawals to date have been so low.   Both the Storage withdrawals shown
above and the Flowing gas should flow on Primary firm capacity since we have
been assigned this capacity by AGL.    The above numbers also assume that we
will be maximizing our withdrawals of AGL's IBSS (Incremental Bundled Storage
Service) during March.  The IBSS withdrawals are not  included in the storage
withdrawal volumes shown above, since we schedule the IBSS ourselves at AGL's
citygate.

Please call me if you have questions and I will be forwarding you a final copy
of the spreadsheet with these numbers in a short while.

Sorry for the delay!

DPL has issued a revised OFO for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th.  I 
will
need to adjust my volumes as follows:

23rd - cut volume of 883 to 723 dth on TGT K# 6057 (was originally 1203 dth)

24th - cut volume of 823 to 622 dth on TGT K# 6057 (was originally 1203 dth)

25th - cut volume of 1203 to 662 dth on TGT k#6057

Effective the 26th - 31st, please keep my volumes at 1203 dth per day.

DPL may revise the 24th and 25th tomorrow.   I will update you tomorrow.
Thanks for your help.   (Kim is out today so you will need to contact me with
any questions).

The restrictions at BGE will continue today the 19th.  The posting said it
might last until Friday.  Like yesterday, Fred will be determining how much
extra needs to be bought and delivered intraday.  I will work with Enron to 
buy
the gas and get the contract number in order to nom the supply and the 
customer
allocations.  If the customer burns more than 3% over what we have allocated 
to
them, they will be buying gas at the $12.00 Production Rate.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you,

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Chris--The attached table is an updated version of the one I sent you last
night.   The only thing missing is the AGL numbers which I am finalizing now,
since we understand our latitude with respect to the storage.   I will forward
a complete version of the attached to you with the AGL numbers shortly, but I
wanted to get you the COH Choice numbers, which now reflect the Baseload
storage withdrawals volumes for March.   Also, the attached version contains
the correct numbers for the programs scheduled by K. Novsek.

One other point, the COH choice volumes shown in the rows labelled 'PRIM' are
total requirements less storage withdrawals only.  I have not subtracted the
volumes of March physical hedged previously hedged by Brian Perrone.

Please call if you have questions.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking 
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with 
Ed
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.

facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks

Hi Lori,

I believe we are still pulling our Local Production from you behind NYSEG,
please let me know ASAP if you disagree.

I am going to pull    1620 dth's/day  , again, let me know if this creates a

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

67829 = 8527 (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

67831 = 3473 (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

67830 = 3000  (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

IDLE FTS = ask Joann. We have been using 66930 = 4000  and 66931 = 4000.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Lilco released the Transco Capacity to CES for June.  We still have not

the capacity.  The volume is 84 dth (offer #19858) and you don't get billed a

participating in the program.

Do you want to execute this capacity?

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from 
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.   However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.     When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I 
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.    She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.   I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short,  we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).   Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.   
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

When CES runs out of transport and takes more than their "their first of the 
month" volume on any given day, the price is GD App + $.06 + FT variable 
cost.  This works real well with Scott's $.05 IT discount.   

What I don't know about is the Aristech capacity, does that belong to CES or 
ENA for May?  I apologize upfront if someone has already responded.

Subject: CES contract - Choice Demand Swings in April 2000 - PLEASE READ

Colleen need your help with this one. Choice is having huge temperature 
swings causing drastic demand changes. Also, the new Choice SST contract mdq 
was reduced from 134,000 to 54,000 in April. There are several cold days that 
are causing ENA to service Choice via IT ($0.05/dkt) and Contract Overruns 
($0.21/dkt).
Do these charges get passed back to CES?

The TCO schedulers are trying to be proactive, by looking at Intraday Temps. 
Unfortunately, we are having a hard time estimating the actual burn. The CDC 
posts a forecast, one day before gas flow. CDC does not post intraday temps, 
we look at the National Weather Service. CDC only posts actuals, once the gas 
day is ended. Once the gas day is ended, TCO and CDC only allow adjustments 
on the SST contract as a no-notice storage withdrawal adjustment. Because the 
burns are increasing during the cold periods, we are overrunning the 
contracts.

Just want to ensure everyone is on the same page before ENA receives TCO's 
April bill, and CES receives ENA's April bill. I have not discussed this with 
CES yet, wanted to ensure ENA is on the same page.

So far this month:

4/4 IT = 25,589 Overrun = 6000
4/8 IT = 22,226 Overrun = 8000
4/9 IT = 12,404 Overrun = waiting on actuals
4/10 IT = 8,200 Overrun = waiting on actuals

Accumulated Estimated Cost

IT = $3421 Overrun = $2940

There was another suggestion to use the Idle transport for Hopewell and Calp. 
At this time, I strongly advise not using the swing transport. If Hopewell 
and Calp come up... it is usually late intraday... and does not give us 
enough time to switch the transport with the CDC's. The penalty for Choice 
gas not showing up is $25/dkt and getting kicked out of the Choice program. 
The CDC's do not accept retro's for Choice gas. Believe me... I have tried 
several times!!!! Usually CES has enough behind the citygate pool gas to help 
balance for minor differences (under 100 dkt). Also, TCO is not as friendly 
as they used to be in doing retro's for Choice gas.

Thank you for your help.

citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  5/31 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    The  file there are three  worksheets labelled
as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':

Please note that for the month of June '00 CES is purchasing additional 
volumes
of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The
volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email...

 as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
 the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it 
wasn't March 15?

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please
forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.

The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The
demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating
correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective 
June
1.

Please look at the following contracts/deals.

Contract  Deal      Comment
779234         003589         Boston releasing to CES
771157         003668         CES releasing to ENA
771224         003786         ENA releasing to Energy Express

Subject:  Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

Dayton Power is away from the office on Friday and Monday for the new year
holiday.  They have requested nominations for the 1st to the 4th by 2:00 
today.

The first day of January is the most critical.  I will have the ability to
adjust any of the days from my home over the weekend on an intraday basis.

I will need to work with Joann and Joni (Tco schedulers) to get the 
nominations
in place.

I'll call you, Chris, after morning trading to devise a game plan for the 1st.

If Joann works here today, I'm going to need to stay close by.

volumes I anticipate flowing on the 1st, assuming Enron elects to continue
basing ETNG, then Transco, and finally Sonat:


IBSS  13,802

ETNG    4,083

Transco  5,332

Sonat/SGNG  3,941


I spoke with Phil Villagomez and got the ETNG contract # ... now I just need
the Transco contract #'s and associated volumes.

Thanks,

David

Heidi, the volume of 100dth on k65403 to CGV1-34 is being cut because of 
capacity allocation at mkt-34, you do not have any primary contracts to that 
area.  Please call Chris Germany for more information.  


thanks
joann

When we spoke today I mentioned I was fine with April Storage as long as there
was nothing drastically wrong on your or my part. After being on vaca for a 
few
days and realizing what went on, it appears we have overnominated for 3-4 days
for deliveries into storage. Let's talk about this as we do not want $5/dth
penalties.

I will be entering individual deals for CES until we come up with a better

Hendrickson, Sarah Mullholland and myself Thursday afternoon to discuss deal 
tickets and pricing?

Good - bad?

Let me know.  Also, I will be out of the office tomorrow.

Joann,

Here is the distribution of the CES EU deal that Chris did with Charlie last
week.  The original deal volume was
for 263,580 dth/month. Doug could you please ask Chris if he will keep us 
whole
on the contracted price for
the extra 20,000 dth?

Joann pls call me if you have trouble reading this.  Please note that the
volumes to 8-35 are for TIMET only (k64939).

Thanks,
Kara

For the Ohio gas, we should be pulling any additional volume out of our Bank
and we will bill first of month, any thing we dont burn should be put into our
bank, MME will have to buy the bank at the end of the month anyway.

For the other Major account areas unless it is a major adjustment, I was
assuming gas daily plus transport + premium

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27.  We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for 
these
types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

I just found out through COH reports that 500 dth delivered to mkt 5-7 via
K38094 (First Energy) did not show up on the 26th of January.

As a result of this and other factors, a total delivery volume to that agg 
pool
went from the 484 dth requested amount to 217 dth.  This was during the OFO
period.  Not sure how we are going to handle the resulting penalties, but just
wanted to make sure that Enron does not pay First Energy for those volumes.
Sorry I was not notified of this cut sooner.

Please let me know if ?s

Hey guys, I am looking for NYSEG TCO gas.    I believe the correct Op area

is as follows:  Op2 Mkt 20  MLI 21

I need approximately 300 dth/day for 1/28 - 1/31.

Subject: Re: TCO STOW Overage - 1/24 - NEED ANSWER


What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me
to cut the enduser gas? P

 If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me...
is to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day
to avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need
a decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!!

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject:  TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted
amount (+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was
over-withdrawn. Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage
over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the
weekend. If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the
storage over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please
tell me what you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is
still feeling generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try
to cause unnecessary pain.

Sent a retro request to TCO last week with two options:

1) Inject into storage from CES IPP pool, which was long that day.
2) In ground storage transfer from Dayton's FSS storage to CES's FSS storage. 
Dayton has given Enron the approval to move this storage.

I told TCO the second option would be the most viable option, and it should 
not comprise TCO's position with its other shippers. 

As of right now, TCO has put all retro requests on hold. The bills will 
probably go out with these penalties on it. However, TCO will revisit the 
penalty issue, once the dust has settled. We are not the only shipper that 
incurred penalties, and TCO wants to treat everyone fairly. I did tell TCO to 
remember that Enron is not an affiliate, and TCO needs to treat Enron as TCO 
would its other shippers.

What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me
to cut the enduser gas?

 If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me...
is to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day
to avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need
a decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!!

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Cora Pendergrass has been working with Michcon, along with the CES people, to 
try to resolve the penalty issue.  Michcon has advised us that instead of 
assessing CES the $10-$15 penalty they could conceivably charge, they are 
reducing it to $.25.  Just for your info, the penalty could have been as high 
as $585,000; instead, it ends up being about $10,000.

Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Before I respond to Chris on this, it brings up a question.  I know we 
included the cost of the parking service in the true up, but what about the 
value of the gas?  If gas was parked, then we received free gas---did we 
account for this somewhere in the deal  (i.e., it should be a positive to 
ENA)?  If so, then the question on the sale of this gas is simple--was it a 
one day swing sale to CES-Retail or was it part of the base load package, 
then bill that price accordingly.  If we got the gas for free, then that's a 
different story.

Please let me know what was booked for this deal.   Thanks.

I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the 
gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for 
this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a 
wholesale transaction.

Per the note below; this is 13,396/day x 11 days = 147,356. Some of the gas 
is connected to Interconnect Gas. In the past we have kept the Interconnect 
Gas whole by taking it to STOI. We will need some guidance on this tomorrow. 

Joann, let me know if you need help with the nom's... since there will be a 
lot of them to change around.

Kathy,  If I remember this correctly,  this is gas purchased by John Singer 
behind the citygate that CES actually nommed directly.  We simply put the 
deals into the system as buy/sells.  I talked to Chris and he said that B & B 
will have the paper you need.  I hope this helps.Victor

The deal 226556 with volume of 4991 was billed and paid separately.  Volume 
was supposed to be 5000  (B&B still wants the 9 difference).  I just talked 
to John Singer and he is checking with B&B and with  National Fuel Gas for 
some paper.  He also indicated that this citygate gas was nommed into CES's 
pool.  If so, someone should be billing CES for it .


WRP










Victor and Robert, 
Please let us know if you can be of any help on this one.  The only deal with 
volumes that I see for Beldan and Blake is deal 226556 and it appears to have 
been netted with a CES deal 235398, in which case there would be nothing in 
navigator.  The deal that I believe Wade is referring to is 345224, but it is 
showing a zero volume in unify.  

Terry, I see several deals out there for Beldan and Blake all at NYSEG but 
with different prices.  The only one with volume is 226556 for a total volume 
of 4991.  Is  possible that all the volume may have been put on the one deal 
and should have been spread amongst the several deals?

Thanks!

Kathy

Subject: Belden & Blake May-00 NFGD PA Invoice

 Volume Management (Angel Fuller), has been unable to locate any volumes for 
Belden & Blake for May-00 NFGD PA (National Fuel Gas) gas under Columbia Gas 
Transmission.  She researched her actuals and looked on Columbia Navigator 
under ENA and NFGD PA  and was unable to find volumes as invoiced. B&B is 
invoicing for 1302 mcf.  The Sitara deal that was used for March used CGAS 
Point  21 NYSEG  02 Constrained Citygate and has pricing of $3.30 as per the 
invoice. 

Can you give us any more clues as to where we might find this gas?  Some 
place else on Navigator? Can B&B supply us with some kind of statement?

Please let me know.

Thanks  WRP

Scott, Chris and Dan,

Attached you will find the contract minimum for Dayton capacity for January.

We did not have a basis trader over here so I had to guess at the numbers for
Jan.  You will see those listed in Red.

I'll update ASAP on Monday after visiting with Dayton and our trading staff.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  5/30 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

As everyone already knows we(Enron) does not have a shared drive for the 
Daily.est.  So if everyone could update the sheet with their own volumes and 
email me back i will consolidate it to (1).  Thanks




Please have your est volumes by 5:00pm Jan 25 (Tuesday)

Chris,

Have you been able to figure out if Enron has billed Ashland for Jan, Feb and
Mar on an old 1022/day Columbia contract?  If so, please let me know so we can
make the appropriate adjustment with the Ashland volumes.

Thanks

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.  



Should you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9138.

Chris--I apologize for having to revise the numbers I sent a few minutes ago,
but I had made an erroneous assumption about the volume of SONAT storage gas
that we could withdraw in March.  I will put these values into the spreadsheet
that I sent earlier, but this will give you an idea of what the numbers look
like.



As in my prior message, the above values for storage withdrawals assume that 
we
are maximizing the withdrawals from the so-called "Directly Assigned Storage"
that ENA schedules on our behalf.  I believe that notwithstanding the above
storage withdrawal values, we will still have storage inventory left at the 
end
of March since our withdrawals to date have been so low.   Both the Storage
withdrawals shown above and the Flowing gas should flow on Primary firm
capacity since we have been assigned this capacity by AGL.    The above 
numbers
also assume that we will be maximizing our withdrawals of AGL's IBSS
(Incremental Bundled Storage Service) during March.  The IBSS withdrawals are
not  included in the storage withdrawal volumes shown above, since we schedule
the IBSS ourselves at AGL's citygate.   Note also that the total daily volume
on Sonat--Stg WD plus Flowing-- is higher than in my prior transmittal.  The
reason is that I am assuming no peaking inventory withdrawals during March
versus daily withdrawals of approximately  2,800 dth/day in my prior
transmittal.    This translates into a higher gas requirement from Enron.

Again, sorry for the confusion and this should do it.

The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  5/31 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\JUN_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':

Please note that for the month of June '00 CES is purchasing additional 
volumes
of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The
volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume 
of
the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

Okay... CES should be up-to-date on all Navigator data runs for CES, ENA, 
CALP as shippers for Jan, Feb, Mar, and April. I sent each month seperately 
to Molly and Ernie as comma delimited files. Ernie was successful with the 
first file I sent.

Just remember that these files include the complete data dump for all 
transport. I sent Molly and Ernie the package id's that should be excluded 
(Enron Markets). 

Also, the volumes may change or have changed due to TCO actuals.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's possible BUG, ConEd and Lilco may release capacity to you for June. If so
let me know. Please release Boston gas capacity to "Energy Express" and let me

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.


The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Per the sales reps and GMS I will need the following:


100 dth per day to meter # 020030
596 dth per day to meter # 020028

I will receive a final number for these next week but this is an estimate.
(should not be that far off).

Subject: Theoretical Storage


We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times 
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

converted to a new type of contract. I assume this is one that is released to
us for their Choice program. Who should get the copy and could you please give

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  5/26 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Per my voicemail message to John.

I talked to Stacy Miller at TCO to better understand the SIT limitations.

TCO has something called TFE (Total Firm ???). Plants can burn up to this 
amount and plus 1.03%.

Allied has the following FTS capacity;

39095 50075
62672 3333

Total 53408
 x 1.03

Total allowed without penalty 55,010

Stacy, Cindy, Steve please verify this amount.

If Allied burns above this amount then they will be subject to penatly, even 
if SIT withdrawal is allowed. TCO has started to enforce this penatly again.

Stacy did say that we could true-up the next day to avoid the penatly, like 
we do for the Cogen's. However, you still need capacity above 55,010 to meet 
the burns. That is why Cindy was letting Allied use its SIT withdrawal and 
Aristech's contract. Unfortunately, this was cut by TCO by about 50%.

Not sure what you want to do John. You are welcome to talk to Chris and Scott 
about using Enron's Capacity... but ours is maxed out for the Cogen's in that 
area. International Paper may have some idle capacity, you would have to talk 
to Amy at Alliance 502-426-4500 x7372.

This brings up another question. When will Allied be transferred to another 
fuel manager?? Lee Tippet said it would be effective April 1st. If it is not 
April 1st, Allied needs to sign the piece of paper to allow Enron access to 
perform Allied's nominations. If Allied still refuses this to do it, you will 
need someone at CES to perform these nominations. I will not have access to 
my CES account on April 1st to do Allied's nominations.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.

This is slightly revised.

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4771 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 196 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

This is gas that was missing from our first of the month volumes. that should
be within our 10% swing.  The scheduler told me there aren't any restrictions
currently and with the additional volumes we would be within our 10% swing.
Either way wouldn't this be billed at gas daily as long as we are not
restricted?

Joann,

Please redirect the following:

from mkt 7-3 cut 9039 dth total off K61822 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

from mkt 7-8 cut 6413 dth total off K65402 (please prorate thru
ROM) take to 7-1

In addition to the redirects, I am also requesting more gas delivered to 7-1
from you, 13500 dth total, if you could please prorate that through the rest 
of
the month as well.

We can start this on the 12th if that works for you.

Thank you!

TCO decided to reverse the penalties Enron incurred in January and February. 
The credit is on the TCO's invoice for April.

January = $13,424
February = $13,775

Total Credit = $27,199

TCO Team discussed this penalty situation with TCO's VP, Marsall Lang. TCO 
decided that Enron had not abused the system and did not overrun the TFE 
(Total Firm Entitlement). YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi Ernie.  You probably did not know I am in another group now.  It is even

Per John Whited, Effective May 1st, 2000:

Aristech will be managed by Strategic Energy (Hans Rottman.... former CES 
employee... who originally got this account).

Enron will no longer do the agency nominations for Aristech.

Jesse/Cindy/John; please check if the term supply deal from Columbia Gulf for 
Aristech goes  past April 30, 2000.

Scott/Chris/Jeff/John; please determine how you want to handle the release of 
Aristech's transport to CES in May 2000.

Special Note:
This concludes all agency deals that Enron TCO staff was scheduling for CES. 
There are no more agency deals.

My only suggestion are as follows:
(1)  We need to be more explicit about the de-coupling of the assets from the 
gas that is delivered to CES by ENA.  As such, I would recommend that we 
expand Sections 4.1 and 4.2  to include a CES paper pool storage or bank 
which gets credits (theoretical injections) and debits (theoretical 
withdrawals).  The credits to the bank would be made in accordance with the 
"Theoretical Storage Injection Schedule (TSIS)" as per 4.2 and Exhibit 2.  
The debits to the bank would be made per the daily CES nominations on days 
when the retail demand is greater than the daily purchase quantity defined on 
Exhibit 1.  The one exception to this de-coupling is that all of the 
debits/credits would be subject to operational constraints imposed by the Gas 
Storage Contracts and the Gas Transportation Contracts.  The constraints 
should only come into play with the debits, as the TSIS (which by definition 
will be less than the daily MDIQ) would rarely be impacted by constraints.  
At the end of the term, the bank balance and the physical storage balance 
will need to be equal.  If not, provision needs to be made for a post term 
true-up.

(2)  In the last sentence of Section 4.1, should the remedy for CES's failure 
to notify in a timely manner be "penalties" or "ENA damages," which would 
include both penalties and trading losses &/or opportunity costs?  I am not 
certain, but I understood it to be the latter.

  Per Jeff Hodge.

Here is an initial draft of an Agreement to finalize the retail issues.  
Please note that I have not included anything on gas buy back yet.  I would 
like to get some confirmation on that issue before drafting.

Otherwise, your thoughts and comments will be appreciated.  I look forward to

Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for
Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought for
4/1 and would there be any cost?

Need your assistance.   Obviously I need your expertise on Tennessee (and
someone's on Transco).   We need to get gas to S. Ct. and Ct. Natural 
citygates
for February.

Here's a what if...........I just spoke with a Tennessee rep to ask about
Transco Rivervale and Tennessee.   They are currently allowing short hauls at
this point.     However,  could we bring in some Transco at Rivervale and do a
short haul on Tennessee Mawaw (spelling)?   As of today I was told it could
flow to the above citygate meters.   (although this could change overnight).
I know we did this a few times last winter also.

How does Transco look for this?    As you can tell I am not even aware of the
economics.   If this would work what would it cost?  Can you check with Chris
(I don't know his e-mail address)?

Attached is additional information from CES regarding administration of the 
GELP deal.  They have given us the contact at CGV to discuss the meter 
reading process--Joan, can you follow up with CGV to find out how this is 
going to work?  Also, Kim saved these documents in the same directory that 
Joan put all the last documents in (in the GELP directory) and she has also 
printed them out.  If you want hard copies, just ask her.  Just for the 
record, the good news is that the winter is almost over and that seems to be 
when most of the work under this contract occurs--once the summer is here 
there is a back to back deal with Duke for gas supplies.  The other good news 
is that it looks like you all will get the opportunity to learn quite a bit 
about fuel oil.  The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be too much up 
side in this deal.  The $5,000 monthly fee is about all you get unless you 
can get gas to them between November and February and receive your $.05 fee 
on that volume.  

Anyway, CES is planning on our taking over both the GELP and CALP contracts 
the first week of March.  This will give us 3 weeks of administering it and 
asking all of our questions before the CES contacts are no longer there.  
This means we need to very quickly decide who is going to prepare which 
reports, how exactly we will handle the fuel oil deliveries (will the gas or 
fuel oil guys handle this?), meter reading, contact lists, etc,   I realize 
it is bid week and very difficult to get you all together, but I'd like to 
have a quick meeting on Monday, February 28 at 11:00 am in Room 3125B to 
discuss the GELP and CALP contracts.  Please let me know if you cannot make 
it.  Thank you.

Subject: GELP, additional information


First, I wanted to follow up yesterday's question on GELP meter reading and 
how
Enron gets this information in the future.  I can't provide a direct answer to
this question, but can provide a contact at Columbia Gas of Virginia to 
discuss
the situation.   Lisa Jesse is the Industrial Account Rep. (at 804-323-5343)
and quite familiar with GELP.  I am making her aware of the transition and 
will
briefly discuss the options available.  You should probably make contact for
more relating to LDC information and equipment.

Also, I wanted to forward some examples of the fuel oil information we handle.
The "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" and "1999_2000 Winter Oil Orders" will give you 
an
idea of where we actually stand as of this morning and where I am in the
February tracking process.  On the "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" attachment you 
will
see delivery by delivery, plant Vs BOL (transporter delivery tickets) and a
summary sheet that identifies any discrepancies fairly quickly.  We are
provided the actual delivery tickets via mail, from the Plant (weekly), and
maintain those records.  The paragraph below is basically a repeat from the
original note, but I wanted to make sure the information wasn't missed.



We are responsible for the procurement, coordination and tracking of their 
fuel
oil activities through the winter period.  We've relied on CITGO, BPAmoco and
Marathon Ashland to provide the bulk of our oil supplies in the past.  The 
only
means of transporting oil to this facility is truck and the above suppliers
have been good about coordinating delivery to the facility.  GELP has a 5
million gallon oil tank on site and need to maintain 4.5 million gallons of
inventory through the winter period (FLASH... due to oil prices and
availability, this is under consideration).  The Plant has very specific
requirements prior to accepting delivery from any supplier... they demand a
specific 'Sulfur content' test (ASTM D-2622 test) be performed, sent, and
approved by Plant personnel prior to allowing any transporters into their
facility.  I have also included basic fax covers sent during this process
including the actual confirmation of placing the order, having the appropriate
oil testing and then faxing the test results to the Plant upon receiving them
from suppliers.

Again, let us know if you need anything further.  Thanks.

Still showing up.  Release number 19858-1 is released to CES for July from 
Lilco.  Last time I talked with Lilco, they had to release to CES, not ENA.  
Does the same apply for July?

Lilco released the Transco Capacity to CES for June.  We still have not 
executed
the capacity.  The volume is 84 dth (offer #19858) and you don't get billed a
demand charge from the pipeline.  I believe Lilco bills CES directly for
participating in the program.

Do you want to execute this capacity?

thanks

For APRIL 1,   The Choice sale to CES is deal #227081.  The Baseload RETAIL  
sale to CES deal # is 227113.  I created new tickets because the ones we are 
using are HUGE!!!! and they are very slow and use a tremendous amount of 
memory that slows everything down.  I also rolled the volumes from March into 
April.   Joann please update when CES informs you of the numbers   THANKS ,

The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from 
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of 
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title 
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user 
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool 
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer 
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU  
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.

Subject: Equitrans

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?  
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts 
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).  
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe 
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my 
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing 
shipper is and the primary receipt and delivery points.
