Bill,

	In addition, although not required for a Transwestern bankruptcy filing, the name of the electric utility providing electric service to Northern Natural's Hubbard, Iowa compressor station is: Midland Power Cooperative.

Linda,

	This looks fine. I just want to confirm that we do not countersign this transportation service request when we receive it from the potential shipper. Instead, we process the request and generate a transportation agreement that we send to the shipper for execution. When we receive an executed transportation agreement from the shipper, we countersign it and begin service. Is this correct?

Bill, Teb,

Attached is an electronic version of the request for gas transportation form that we would like to implement for TW in the new contract system..  It is very similiar to FGT's.  Would you please review and let me know if this looks okay.

Thanks

Linda

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

The amendment that I think you're referring to was not signed. We sent it to Starwood and then nothing happened. If you can't find a hard copy, you can call Rell Tipton at V&E and ask him to e-mail you the latest version of the Starwood amendment that he's been working on. If you can't reach Rell, his assistant, Birdie Cortinas can probably help. Rell's number is (713)758-4506. Hope this helps.

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

The attached spreadsheet breaks out scheduled volumes West of Thoreau for the period May, 2000 through October, 2001.  
The first tab of the spreadsheet breaks out the volumes by month; the second tab is a summary for the reporting period.  

Please note, for the reporting period, there were some scheduled receipts.  These have been listed separately and can be easily removed if necessary.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Dennis,

To follow up from our meeting today, please provide the delivery report that includes the following:

WHAT	Total volumes (by month) delivered to primary delivery points versus alternate delivery points
WHEN	For the period of 5/00 thru 10/31
WHERE	For all delivery points West of Thoreau (including: Calif pool, Window Rock, PGE/Mojave Topock and SOCAL Needles)
WHO	Send to William Rapp (legal), Kim Watson and myself

This information will be used to respond to criticism by the California PUC.  I believe that Bill Rapp is wanting to respond by early Wednesday so if he could get these numbers by end of day Monday, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

Mark

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.

Attached is a revised draft of the letter. The only change from the prior draft is to the volumes in the first sentence of the second paragraph. I've changed the contracted capacity figure from 120,000 Mcf to 106,700 per feedback from Keith. I think this is now ready to file, except that we will need to fill in the blanks. Please confirm this and give me a call at your convenience so that we can discuss the logistics of the filing. Thanks.

Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 

I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated. 

We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Steve and Kim,

	I spoke with Drew after the staff meeting today regarding what limitations would be imposed by the new credit agreement on Transwestern's dealings with its affiliates, most notably ENA/EWS. Drew said that this and a number of other issues are still being negotiated and that it's not yet clear where we'll wind up. Obviously, we'll try and negotiate as much flexibility on the affiliate issue with the banks as possible. Drew indicated that the agreement should be finalized in the next day or so and that he would issue guidance on this and other issues as soon as it is.

Joel,

	Yes, I would start with Michael. He did a calculation a year or so ago when OWC first filed for bankruptcy and should be able to update that. Another source is Maureen Palmer, who (if you haven't met her yet) is the EES business person who is responsible for the OWC/EES relationship. You should probably speak with Maureen in any event to get her input on whether EES really wants to pursue this claim. When I spoke with her about this several months ago, there was apparently a difference of opinion among our business people on this. Good luck. Let me know if I can help on anything else.

Do we have a revised draft of the responses to the data requests ready for review? I will be out of the office on Monday, when the responses must be filed. So, I would appreciate the opportunity to review the responses sometime today. Thanks.

Drew and Greg,

	Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  I wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. I would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

		Look under my general file in the j drive. There should be a folder labeled "Fast Track". In that folder, there should be a document titled either "Fast Track Swap Agreement" or "Swap Agreement". There could be multiple drafts of this document, so use the one with the most recent date.

Lorraine,

	Thanks for forwarding the attached message. The way I read this, PSNM is effectively withdrawing its demand for the collateral as long as we don't use the contract. We should probably send them a letter confirming that this is the case. I would suggest that you just send an e-mail in response stating that what PSNM has proposed is acceptable and that our understanding is that PSNM will not require collateral as long as we don't utilize the contract. Therefore, PSNM's demand for collateral by December 15 is, based on our understanding, withdrawn. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

I talked to my Supervisor and here is what we can do, PNMGS will not accept or confirm any nominations under Off-System Transportation Contract T39817.  This will put the Contract in an "INACTIVE" status instead of total Termination of the Contract.
Prior to any  future expectation of Off-system Transportation, pursuant to Contract T39817 between PNMGS and TWPC, there will then be an updated and current determination on the Financial Responsibility as set forth under ARTICLE XII. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.   PNMGS will then decide what, if any, steps will need to be taken prior to such Off-system Transportation.

	I have no idea. I have never heard of these swaps. I don't know when these were implemented. Presumably after we signed the original deal, although I don't know. Apparently, the people on our trading desk dealt with the customer without getting legal input. Scary. You may want to check with Jim Keller's/Mike Smith's group to see if anyone there knows anything about this.

Deborah, we need to paper the swaps outlined in the attachment and get to the customer for execution.  Apparently this was overlooked when we did the deals initially...although I can't imagine what we were thinking in not obtaining documentation for these.

I would like to get these out on Tuesday at the latest.  On the issue of the 77,500 MMbtu, I will address directly with the customer and let you know what I find out.

Thanks.

RZ

Richard,
To answer your first question, #326528 does not begin until Jan 1, 2002 so nothing has been billed out yet. For your second question, I agree that the 77,500 for Dec 01 of #328974 does look random. But I cannot verify anything for you besides what is in RGS. That is why we originally sent this spreadsheet to you to verify what was correct and what was incorrect in RGS. If this volume is incorrect, we need to unwind the deal in RGS immediately. Please let Russ and I know what you find out so the volumes can be fixed in RGS if needed. Thanks

Jennifer

Jennifer, pls see my slightly enhanced file attached.  Can you determine when Contract # 326528 began billing?  I need an Effective Date for the contract.  Also, the 77,500 MMBtu for Dec. 01 looks totally random and doesn't match with the volumes for the remainder of the months for #328974.  Any thoughts on that one?

Thanks.

Richard,
I have attached the financial deals in RGS for 2001 where the originator is VEG Desk. Russ and I had discussed these deals with you a few weeks ago. Can you please verify that the pricings are correct, as we have nothing to verify these against. Thank you

Attached is a draft of an agreement that would terminate the transportation agreement that Transwestern has with Public Service of New Mexico. Assuming that PSNM is okay with the concept of terminating the agreement, I have no problem with providing this draft to PSNM. Please call if you have any questions or comments.

FYI (if you don't already know this)

I don't keep close watch of each and everyone's time.  That is, in the sense that I know how much vacation each of you has left this year.  I can print reports so you can keep up with it, but I don't police everyone's time that closely.  Just wanted everyone to know so if you loose some vacation, it will be your fault.

Let me know when you want another printout before year end.

I  :o)

Patsy,

	Since I haven't heard back from you re the e-mail I sent earlier this week, I assume that you're going to pass on the Nutcracker. Although I'm disappointed, I guess it's better to know this now rather than further down the road.

	Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed meeting you and talking with you. You're a very, very nice person. So, I hope you find the person you're looking for. Take care and best wishes for you and your family. Happy Holidays!

Subject:	RE: Hubbard (ENA)

I visited with Charlie Graham this AM.  To the best of operations knowledge, the past due statement for October(past due Dec. 2nd.) was mailed Dec.5th.  Midlands normal practice is to discontinue service 10 days after mailing the past due notice.  I think it is safe to assume that we must have the attached letter in the appropriate Midland Officials hand before the 15th.

Charlie has agreed to represent Operations and call Midland power and to assure the letter is received by Midland asap.

Charlie,  the following are contacts we have used in the past for Midland.
Roger Wick---515-386-4111  (most likely the best starting point)
Patrick Minnick---712-297-5738  Key Accounts Executive
Norm Fandel---515-386-4111   Director of Marketing


Jerry, we should probably visit about this on the outage call this afternoon.  We'll need to get planning to run some capacity numbers just in case.
 
Thanks
Tom

Subject:	Hubbard (ENA)

After the meeting yesterday and speaking to Bill Rapp and several others today I believe I can summarize the Hubbard/ENA circumstances as they exist right now:

1)  The Hubbard Compression Services Agreement is with Enron North America (ENA) and ENA has filed for bankruptcy.
2)  The outstanding Oct. ($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all).
3)  Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative.
4)  Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?).
5)  ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of "Monthly Fuel Gas Payable" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing.  (This is their source of cash!?)
6)  Gas Accounting will continue to pay the "Monthly Demand Charge" ($64,549), and the "Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges" (ranges from $300 to $40,000).  The next payment is not due until the end of December.
7)  ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month.  One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th.
8)  ENA's next $320,000 "Peak Associated Payment" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002.

There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.  The theme I keep hearing is business as usual. 

Tom,

Someone from Operations should probably follow-up with Midland Power (I suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ENA letter.

Charlie,

	I think your summary is very good. I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with "adequate assurance" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service.

Subject:	Hubbard (ENA)

After the meeting yesterday and speaking to Bill Rapp and several others today I believe I can summarize the Hubbard/ENA circumstances as they exist right now:

1)  The Hubbard Compression Services Agreement is with Enron North America (ENA) and ENA has filed for bankruptcy.
2)  The outstanding Oct. ($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all).
3)  Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative.
4)  Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?).
5)  ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of "Monthly Fuel Gas Payable" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing.  (This is their source of cash!?)
6)  Gas Accounting will continue to pay the "Monthly Demand Charge" ($64,549), and the "Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges" (ranges from $300 to $40,000).  The next payment is not due until the end of December.
7)  ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month.  One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th.
8)  ENA's next $320,000 "Peak Associated Payment" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002.

There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.  The theme I keep hearing is business as usual. 

Tom,

Someone from Operations should probably follow-up with Midland Power (I suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ENA letter.

	Chris,

		Good to hear from you. I didn't bring the Starwood documents with me when I moved (can you believe that I forgot them?!!!), so I'm going off of memory. I believe that we are obliged to at least offer lease financing to Starwood if the conditions precedent to financing in the lease documents are satisfied. However, we do have the ability to pass through increased costs of capital that we incur as well as other appropriate costs to Starwood. 

		Hope things are going well.

Subject:	re: Starwood Questions

Bill,

I hope your new job is treating you well.  Sorry to bother you but I had two more questions regarding Starwood that I am hoping you can answer.  They both regard the DSM projects.

1. If Starwood chooses not to use their own capital for DSM projects, is EES obliged to provide lease financing?

2. Related to the above, if we are obliged, are we limited in the rate we can charge?  i.e. Could we charge a "discouraging" rate?  The language in the MLA Section 2.2 seems to be adequately vague that if we were having trouble raising capital ourselves, we could pass those costs through as "such other factors as are customarily considered by lessor parties providing lease financing for similar equipment and terms."  

These questions came up when RAC looked at our summary documentation.  I am hoping these are quick questions for you.  Please let me know.

Thanks again,
Chris

		The latest commodity agreement amendments were not yet filed in the binder. (They were signed right before I left.) However, I gave those to Raquel as well, so you should have them. As I mentioned this morning, Maureen Palmer also has copies.

Raquel has the OWC binders  but I do not see the signed commodity agreement amendments there. Where are those located?

	Drew,

		Steve Harris and the other Transwestern commercial people are seeking guidance on what limits will be imposed by the new credit facility on Transwestern's dealings with affiliates, most notably EWS/ENA. Will it be necessary to obtain the consent of the lenders before Transwestern may enter into any transaction with an affiliate? Are there de minimis exceptions? Are there any plans to obtain pre-approval of either certain categories of transactions or transactions up to an aggregate dollar limit? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

Subject:	Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

FYI (if you don't already know this)

I don't keep close watch of each and everyone's time.  That is, in the sense that I know how much vacation each of you has left this year.  I can print reports so you can keep up with it, but I don't police everyone's time that closely.  Just wanted everyone to know so if you loose some vacation, it will be your fault.

Let me know when you want another printout before year end.

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3.

First of all, all new laptops came with both CD and floppy drives so if he is the orginal owner have him check in the bag.  If it was a redeployed system he may not have received all the pieces.  With that said, an internal floppy drive will run about $75 for the Compaq M700 laptop. Other models may vary in price a bit but probably not by much.

Bill Rapp's laptop (Compaq) is not equipped with the device that allows a 3.5" diskette to be loaded.  He can run CDs, but not diskettes.  What do we need to order and how much will it cost?  Thanks.

Greg and Maria,	

Attached is a first draft of the response to the protest filed by the CPUC. I'm also sending a copy to Steve Sojic and Frank Kelly. I thought we would get your feedback, as well as that of Steve and/or Frank, turn another draft, and then distribute it to the business people on Monday. There is absolutely no pride of authorship on my part, so please don't hesitate to comment. Also, given the relatively short amount of time that we have to file this, I haven't prepared all of the footnotes and citations yet.

	Actually, there was one new development late yesterday. Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having Andy Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of Enron Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to Andy Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested Cindy Olsen. I spoke with Mary Kay and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in Enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting Jeff McMahon. I'll keep you updated. Thanks.

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

Keith,

=09If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new c=
ompressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service=
 within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existin=
g units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months =
after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken o=
ut of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we sh=
ould be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragr=
aph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in servi=
ce within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar=
 deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we=
 would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., c=
ontinue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and place=
d into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operat=
ing compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't=
 do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension fo=
r the abandonment.=20

Mark,
 
        Great to hear from you! The last few weeks have definitely been a difficult period. I still can't believe it. I'm doing fine and actually think that things are beginning to stabilize. 
 
        So, how's the baby doing? And how are you doing? John W. called about a week ago and said he thought you were doing well and seemed to be enjoying your new job (I guess it's not so new anymore). You definitely made the right decision to leave Stratum. As you've probably heard, they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to liquidate. I think they're down to four or five people in New York and about the same number in Houston. 
 
        My address is as follows: 714 Camelot Lane, Houston, Texas 77024. 
 
        Again it's really good to hear from you. Best wishes. (Oh yeah, in case you haven't already seen the following movies, I highly recommend them: "Run Lola Run" (German with English subtitles) and "Memento" (American) - both are available on videotape.) (Also, if I remember correctly, you like classical music, so you might enjoy Murray Perahia's (sp?) recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations.) Take care.

Bill: 

Been thinking of you a lot lately.  I hope that you are well in light of all of the enron news.  

I wanted to send you something via US mail.  I know that you bought a house about 1+ years ago, but I don't have your coordinates.  Can you send them along?

Thanks, Bill. 

Mark

I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to "shippers", we could refer to "customers" instead.

Subject:	RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

Terry Kowalke

I'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have Shipper imbalances.  Here are my comments.

Your comments would be greatly appreciated. We need to file this tomorrow, so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today, if possible. Thanks.

At one point, we considered using a bill management agreement for Consolidated Container. I worked on this with Erin Stus. We came up with a draft that I was fairly happy with and it should be the latest draft under my Consolidated Container file on the j drive. If you can't find it there, give Erin a call. She should still have a copy.
