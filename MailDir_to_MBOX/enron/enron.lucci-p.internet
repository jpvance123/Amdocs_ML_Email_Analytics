Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Hi,

Received your email, thanks for writing me back.  Don't worry I can deal with sarcasm, I just didn't want to include everything as a "turn on" or people would think something was wrong with me.
And as far as the "No Extremist" goes, I really was at a lost for a title and came up with that last minute.  So, now that I've defended my bio, let me knit pick yours, just kidding.  

I'm betting that with "Travelling Chick" as your title you must either travel a lot for work or really enjoy traveling, or both.  I travel a lot in my job, but it seems to come and go in spurts.  Right now we are gearing down for the Holidays, as well as other reasons, and I don't have any trips planned.  

I read your profile, do you really do all those things; hiking, biking, etc?
When do you get your rest?  Why Vail's chair 10, is that where you blew out your knee, and can you still ski?  Tired of all these questions?  One more than I'll let you go.  What pets do you currently have that you would have to disclose at a later date?  

Talk to you later!
Paul

Hello,

I don't know if you received my first email, but since I'm new to this service I figured I'd write again.  Anyway, I found you to be very attractive and your profile to be interesting.  I sent along my profile so you can get an idea as to who I am.  

I have been divorced for about 2 years and although I don't have any children of my own, I don't have a problem with girls that do!  

I would like to talk to you more, so if you feel the same way drop me a line.  I hope to hear from you.

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Hello,

Thanks for the email.  I'll try and answer some of your questions.  I've only been using this servic since last weekend, and so far it's been a kick.  I think as long as you use it for amusement it stays fun.  I don't know really, if it starts getting weird I'll just turn it off.

I live up in Broomfield and work downtown.  I really haven't found anything worthwhile up in our area.  I spend most of my spare time downtown and elsewhere.

We'll have to meet for a drink sometime and all show you around the city!

Paul

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Thanks for the email.  It was my first one!  I just got everything set up on this service and now I'm curious.  I liked what I read in your profile, but I'm wondering why you didn't include a picture?  I think you have me at a disadvantage.  I'll keep this short incase I'm doing something wrong and this email comes back to me.  Drop me a line and we'll chat.

Paul

Hello,

I was going through the pictures on this web site and ran across yours.  I found you to be attractive and your profile to be interesting.  I sent along mine so you can take a look and see if there is any interest.  I hope there is and that I hear from you later.

Paul

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.
