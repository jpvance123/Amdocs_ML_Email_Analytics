Dale,

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

The commercial groups are still interested and are moving 
towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the 
product. As I have  said, we are not the 
decision makers in this case. 

I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.

Vince

great.  How would 100 pm work for you?

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through
license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?
If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our
power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

If Dale comes in to see you, it looks like Eric might be available to meet

I have your fax and the message.  Unfortunately the corporate policy is very

Shirley: 
As requested, herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski.  
The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).  
And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).
    Background
The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread.
Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines.
Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin.
For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.
    EGE Objectives
EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.
    I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).  
    II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.  
    III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.
    Specific EGE Concepts
EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.  
It produces indicative statistics such as:
    a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;
    b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;
    c. the frequency distribution of load level;
    d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;
    e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;
    f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;
    g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and
    h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated).
Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years.
EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001.
EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units.
Other EGE supporting data:
    i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);
    j. actual maximum generating capacity;
    k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);
    l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and
    m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range.
With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.
    The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy
Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy.
Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.
    Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC)
EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities.
ELC transfers its "knowledge" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:
    1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.
    2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.
    3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).
    4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron.
The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered.

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a 
professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a 
statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken 
would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are 
probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if 
Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Thanks!

Vince:

You may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on ERisk.com last Friday. Were Rick Buy's comments about real options taken out of context?


                                  Yann Bonduelle leads a 25-person team for PricewaterhouseCoopers in London
                                  that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from
                                  valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an Internet financial
                                  services business. Here he talks to Rob Jameson about whether this "theoretical"
                                  approach to risky decision-making really helps businesses in their day-to-day
                                  balancing of risk and reward. Yann holds a Ph.D degree from the
                                  Engineering-Economic Systems Department at Stanford University, where he
                                  studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic,
                                  social and business issues. He then worked as a consultant applying his decision
                                  analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making
                                  about innovative products such as electrical vehicles, before joining the
                                  PricewaterhouseCoopers team in 1998  where he is now a partner. He has
                                  written widely on the application of real options, particularly in fields of life
                                  sciences, technology, and e-business, and has a special interest in the
                                  relationship between risk assessment, validation of risk data and financial
                                  valuation.

                                  How would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics?
                                  Most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties
                                  of some kind. Decision analysis helps people explore problems, and redesign
                                  their decision-making process to increase the chance of them making the right
                                  choices. For example, imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide
                                  whether to put itself up for sale, enter a strategic relationship, or continue to go it
                                  alone. Each of those options will lead on to other value-enhancing or
                                  value-destroying scenarios. We work with the client firstly to understand and
                                  challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business
                                  development scenarios, and secondly to help them identify decisions that would
                                  help protect or increase the value of their technology or company. Quantifying
                                  technical, regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge. In
                                  technology-intensive fields, however, we have found that managers (often
                                  scientists) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the
                                  probability that a risky event may or may not occur.

                                  How does this kind of risky decision-making relate to real options valuation?
                                  You can't say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it
                                  for. This means that, to form an opinion about the value of an asset, you must
                                  explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have
                                  a significant impact on the value of the asset. So decision analysis helps to define
                                  the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter-related choices that are, in
                                  effect, "real options". For example, if a company is trying to decide whether to
                                  invest in a risky project, does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment
                                  at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing? That "real" option reduces
                                  the riskiness, and increases the potential value, of the original business plan. So
                                  real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another. But you
                                  don't have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful.

                                  What do you mean?
                                  Often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic
                                  decision, attach weights to these, and show clearly how they interact. For many
                                  companies this "risk discovery" is the most valuable part of the exercise.

                                  Real options theory has been criticised recently for being, well, not very realistic.
                                  Is it a practical approach to valuation?
                                  It's important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to
                                  valuation. But it's an exciting methodology, and it's also sometimes the only
                                  reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem. For example, when a firm
                                  sells an asset, the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset
                                  for legal or corporate governance reasons. But in many businesses today there
                                  are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are
                                  difficult to link to cashflows. The cashflows might not exist because the business
                                  is so novel, or they might be hidden. In some respects, a real options analysis is
                                  much closer to reality than a traditional valuation.

                                  How, exactly?
                                  The classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single
                                  discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity. But this doesn't really take
                                  account of the way that scenarios can change, or the fact that managers can
                                  react to situations as they unfold. I mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or
                                  business at an early point. But the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting
                                  results, it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue-generating
                                  position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows. So to value
                                  a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a
                                  number of scenarios. This is "realistic" in that, if the project gets the green light,
                                  you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all
                                  of the time.

                                  What's the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree?
                                  Modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree -- it's something we
                                  have particular strengths in. But it's also tricky to know when it's worthwhile to
                                  add on more detail, and when it's better to draw back.

                                  In a recent ERisk interview, Rick Buy, chief risk officer of Enron, said that over
                                  the two years that Enron had experimented with the real options concept, it had
                                  found it of "limited, but not zero, use". Why is there a slight air of cynicism about
                                  real options in some businesses today?
                                  It's strange that Enron would profess this attitude. A few years ago, it was widely
                                  reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase
                                  decision. They had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the US
                                  that generated electricity at a very high cost. They knew that they could mothball
                                  them for most of the year, and switch them on only when the electricity prices
                                  were sufficiently high. Nevertheless, from a customer's point of view, there might
                                  have been too much hype about the methodology. One problem in the application
                                  of real options technology is that there are, perhaps, too many people trying to
                                  tweak reality to conform to their "perfect" model. It's better to aim for something
                                  pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time. In one pharmaceutical
                                  company we worked with recently, we worked together to improve their valuation
                                  analyses by moving from a single discounted cash-flow methodology to one that
                                  took into account a rather small set of business scenarios. It would have shocked
                                  some academics and consultants, but it was an undeniable improvement on the
                                  original approach.

                                  Why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field, when
                                  it's been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more?
                                  It might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until
                                  recently, and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed. Also,
                                  industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an
                                  engineering and science background. The dynamic modelling of decisions is
                                  based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical
                                  and electronic systems. This approach is quite distinct from the Black-Scholes
                                  options analyses that the banking world is familiar with: the Black-Scholes
                                  approach is difficult to apply in a real options context, because everything
                                  depends on the assumptions that you put into the Black-Scholes model. The real
                                  options approach, on the other hand, is in a sense a way of modelling those
                                  assumptions more explicitly. But banks are now adopting some of the thinking,
                                  particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify
                                  value-enhancing decisions, and in using real options methodologies to sort the
                                  wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments.

                                  You mean their Internet investments?
                                  We have recently worked with a major Dutch bank that had arrived late in the
                                  Internet game, and then made a considerable number of investments. Now that
                                  even B2B business models have questions marks hanging over them, and many
                                  B2C businesses are already under water, they wanted to work out which
                                  investments might contain real value. In this situation, it's a case of ranking
                                  priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a
                                  decision-making chaos, rather than sophisticated valuation. It's not just a case of
                                  whether an internet investment should be killed off, but the problem of whether
                                  continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major IT
                                  upgrades in existing businesses, and so on. These are very practical questions
                                  and they have to be answered somehow.

                                  Are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this
                                  approach?
                                  Yes, for example, we think it can help work out the value associated with various
                                  approaches to marketing a new bank business line. At the moment, many banks
                                  are chasing high-net-worth individuals, but it's not always clear which kind of
                                  individual a particular bank should decide to pursue. The bank might have a
                                  regional or industry advantage already in one particular area, for example, music
                                  business people. But what is the churn rate associated with this kind of
                                  customer? What is the profitability associated with the customer segment? Will
                                  the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh
                                  any disadvantages? Weighing up this kind of complex problem, where one thing
                                  leads to and depends on another, is what decision and real options analysis is
                                  good at.

                                  Is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations?
                                  In all honesty, not really. The problem is that by the time the option is exercised,
                                  many of the variables surrounding it will have changed, so it's difficult to compare
                                  our original analysis with how things turn out. However, the value of the analysis
                                  comes not only from the final number ("the value of this asset is X") but also from
                                  providing a thorough process, an outsider's point of view, an understanding of the
                                  sources of value and, in short, a bit of clearer thinking.

                                  If real options are so important, why are they so rarely cited in communications to
                                  shareholders and equity analysts?
                                  The battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a
                                  significant part of their internal analysis. Even in major companies in the oil & gas,
                                  and pharmaceutical sectors, where the ideas have taken some root internally,
                                  there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication. We
                                  are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move
                                  things on to the next step.

                                  How does the riskiness of a business, in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it
                                  faces, relate to its share value, and its capital structure?
                                  That's a big question. It's related to work my colleagues do on the optimal
                                  debt-to-equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation, which in turn arises
                                  out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business. The more volatile the
                                  business, the less gearing it can sustain, and the higher the cost of capital. Our
                                  work touches on this in the sense that exercising (many) specific real options can
                                  allow a firm to change its nature, and thus also its risk profile. One classic
                                  example is the pharmaceutical industry. A host of different kinds of companies
                                  service that industry from "big pharma" companies through to smaller
                                  biotechnology startups and run-of-the-mill contract research organisations. A
                                  contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive
                                  environment with relatively few risks--it does not invest in drug development itself
                                 -- but also very thin margins. But in fact, a few of these companies have used the
                                  skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and
                                  profitable healthcare companies of various kinds. It's an example of a company
                                  exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own
                                  identity.

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

Larry,

I was thinking about the potential applications over the weekend
and I think I shall have a proposal for you in a few days.

Vince

P.S. I want to remind you about the favor I asked you about.
We would like to talk (no commitments) to the Prediction Company.
Can you refer me to your friend.

Vince

Dear Vince,

    I just wanted to thank you for inviting me to visit Enron last Friday and
for the generous amount of time you spent with me personally while I was
there.  I found our discussions both informative and stimulating.

    Vince, I was genuinely impressed by the caliber of the group you have
assembled at Enron.  Their individual and collective expertise is obvious;
and they were most generous in exchanging ideas and sharing opinions with me.

    If you or any of your people have, over the weekend, developed further
questions or thought of additional information that might be helpful, I'm
standing by.  I'm eager to continue our dialogue.


    Sincerely,

    Larry Thorne

Dear Vince
Thanks for your voicemail and delighted to have you confirm lunch on May 1.
Kemm Farney the head of WEFA's Electric Power services will be travelling
with me this time. I expect there may be other ENRON colleagues that may
care to join us for lunch so don't hesitate to invite as you see fit. For
reservations purposes, perhaps you arrange to let me know numbers.

Kemm would also be prepared to informally present our current power outlook
to a larger group at 11:00, if this would be of interest.

As you know, these types of presentations are part of all your WEFA Energy
Retainer Package. I will also plan to update you with respect to our current
multi client study schedule for the remainder of the year.

Shirley: 
As requested, herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski.  
The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).  
And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).
    Background
The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread.
Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines.
Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin.
For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.
    EGE Objectives
EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.
    I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).  
    II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.  
    III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.
    Specific EGE Concepts
EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.  
It produces indicative statistics such as:
    a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;
    b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;
    c. the frequency distribution of load level;
    d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;
    e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;
    f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;
    g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and
    h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated).
Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years.
EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001.
EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units.
Other EGE supporting data:
    i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);
    j. actual maximum generating capacity;
    k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);
    l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and
    m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range.
With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.
    The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy
Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy.
Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.
    Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC)
EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities.
ELC transfers its "knowledge" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:
    1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.
    2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.
    3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).
    4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron.
The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered.

Laine,

Enclosed is a revised copy of the Software Licence Agreement with D-G Energy.   The earlier version had prices and conditions of use which differed from what had been discussed over the telephone.   This version brings into line the terms with what has been agreed upon, and has been given tentative approval by the president of D-G, who I met with last week.  

 I have highlighed the sections which have changed from the version that you sent out for signature last November.  

 
I assume that the revised document will have to be reviewed by legal again.   Let me know if I can be of any assistance in this process.

Regards,

Stinson Gibner

Jim,

Thanks for the feed-back. To assist in the further development of the
product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved
? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main
concern was whether or not CHARM would have the capacity to cover the very
different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would
you mind if someone from our CHARM group called you or Mr. Kaminski for
some specific comments ?

Regards,

Bertil

Bertil, I again wish to thank you for the presentation on the CHARM
product.  The response from the group is that the model requires more work
before Enron could consider it as a commercial product.  Please keep me
advised as I assume that you will continue to develop the model.

Hi Vince,

Been meaning to ask for your input about Larry Thorpe's proprietary model for 
electricity returns.  I have not been able to get much information about the 
parameters as Larry says the nature is proprietary.  It is hard to make a 
judgement about its usefulness without such information.  

Larry's e-mails to me indicate that he is working  on NP15 real time prices 
and he promises to share the results with us.  Please advise on direction to 
take as I am not quite sure about the model without further information.

Separately, Larry indicated that you had promised him some data and would 
like to know if you have forwarded it to him.  I can convey your position to 
him.


Thanks.

Larry,

I had a brief discussion with our lawyers.  They are strongly advising us to 
keep the changes we earlier incorporated, but to which you have not 
assented.  As this is a matter of company policy, unfortunately we do not 
have much room to maneuver.  If it would help you to have a direct 
conversation with the lawyers to appreciate our company's perspective, I can 
arrange for a phone call.  Please advise.  Thanks.

Dear Vince
Thanks for your voicemail and delighted to have you confirm lunch on May 1.
Kemm Farney the head of WEFA's Electric Power services will be travelling
with me this time. I expect there may be other ENRON colleagues that may
care to join us for lunch so don't hesitate to invite as you see fit. For
reservations purposes, perhaps you arrange to let me know numbers.

Kemm would also be prepared to informally present our current power outlook
to a larger group at 11:00, if this would be of interest.

As you know, these types of presentations are part of all your WEFA Energy
Retainer Package. I will also plan to update you with respect to our current

Jim,

Thanks for the feed-back. To assist in the further development of the
product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved
? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main
concern was whether or not CHARM would have the capacity to cover the very
different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would
you mind if someone from our CHARM group called you or Mr. Kaminski for
some specific comments ?

Regards,

Bertil

Bertil, I again wish to thank you for the presentation on the CHARM
product.  The response from the group is that the model requires more work
before Enron could consider it as a commercial product.  Please keep me
advised as I assume that you will continue to develop the model.

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @Energy2.1. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email.    Please see below for more information
regarding this new release..

FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of @ENERGY/ErgLib. The
accompanying documentation contains installation and other information.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been
implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and
Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT,
OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all
models.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.6.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.
If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of possible
backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo,
Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional
details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.5.

@ENERGY (Basics)
European options  and strips of European options now support valuation via a
jump diffusion model (see OPT and STRIPOPT functions). Average price options
(see the APO, SPREADAPO, CRACKAPO functions), and average strike options
(see the ASO, SPREADASO functions) now allow for a direct input of the
fixing dates.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
 Includes two new functions, OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation
of complex compound options.

If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of backward
compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and
Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.4.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
	@ENERGY (Forward Curve) is the new module which includes functions designed
to generate forward curves, volatility curves and mean reversion rates used
in many other @ENERGY functions. Module in beta release.

@ENERGY (Basics)
	APO's and ASO's: bug fixed when avg_starts < opt_expiry, and num_fixings=1.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
	No change.

@ENERGY (Weather)
	Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided.

@ENERGY (Swing)
	Pay_at_end with strips: previously implemented was pay at end of  all
periods. Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod. . Module still in
beta release.

	Bug fixes:
1)	if max_const=min_const and max_const in not a multiple of the maximum
daily amount (in previous version min_const was disregarded in this case).
2)	in strip with global constraints: if allowed number of swings per period
changes (currently this can only be due to calendar effects).
3)	strip at index: index was incorrectly evaluated after first sub_period.

New Excel Templates
	The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added:

powercalib.xls	examples of generating @ENERGY parameters for power.

Add-in Manager
Now supports function help. If template is open with the Add-in manager and
function help is requested through the manager, the relevant portion of the
documentation get displayed.

Your input into the refinement of this product is welcome and greatly
appreciated. Any comments or suggestions may be sent to support@fea.com

Vince:

Thanks for that.  I just wanted to get a sense from you who the right people
are and how I can establish effective contact. When he went on to different
responsibilities, John Goodpasture suggested I get the dialog going with the
right commercial people in Enron.  I will be in your neighborhood in the 200
pm time range and will give you a quick call.  That will conserve your
valuable time and hopefully get me in touch with the right people.  I am
reading this after your voicemail, so this supersedes that.

Dale,

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

The commercial groups are still interested and are moving
towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the
product. As I have  said, we are not the
decision makers in this case.

I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through
license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?
If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our
power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
I shall talk to the head of our B2B unit on Friday this week and

I hope he can make a decision at this time whether he is interested
in pursuing this opportunity

Larry,

I had a brief discussion with our lawyers.  They are strongly advising us to keep the changes we earlier incorporated, but to which you have not assented.  As this is a matter of company policy, unfortunately we do not have much room to maneuver.  If it would help you to have a direct conversation with the lawyers to appreciate our company's perspective, I can arrange for a phone call.  Please advise.  Thanks.

Dear Mr. Braun:

As I mentioned, I have recently been reassigned here at Enron.  Although I am 
still in the Enron Transportation Services group, I am no longer the most 
appropriate contact for consideration of the Altos gas model.  I would 
suggest you contact Kim Watson at 713-853-3098 or of course, Vince Kaminski, 
who will remain very much a part of the decision process.  

Regards,

John Goodpasture

Dear Vince,

    I just wanted to thank you for inviting me to visit Enron last Friday and
for the generous amount of time you spent with me personally while I was
there.  I found our discussions both informative and stimulating.

    Vince, I was genuinely impressed by the caliber of the group you have
assembled at Enron.  Their individual and collective expertise is obvious;
and they were most generous in exchanging ideas and sharing opinions with me.

    If you or any of your people have, over the weekend, developed further
questions or thought of additional information that might be helpful, I'm
standing by.  I'm eager to continue our dialogue.


    Sincerely,

    Larry Thorne

Vince:

I will call tomorrow in the morning.  Lunch or right after lunch would be
great.  How would 100 pm work for you?

Dale

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through
license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?
If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our
power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

Give the phones a week or so to get "debugged" and then switch over.
