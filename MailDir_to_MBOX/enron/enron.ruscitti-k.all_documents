You gotta get more current jokes.  That one's been floating around for quite 
some

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Stacey - 

Below are two e-mails sent to you on their respective dates. I think we are 
ready to push on with the ANR ML7 Delivery Location and have suggested some 
language based on comments from Kevin (e-mail dated 5-12). Kevin has called 
and asked for this product. Please offer comments/approval.


5/31/00

I spoke with Mark Schrab in Logistics about the ANR ML7 Product that Kevin 
Ruscettit would like to start trading and he wasn't able to dispell any 
beliefs that this is a product that should not be traded, OTC or otherwise.

Mark explained that often times on this pipe there were cuts due to 
operational constraints. I explained that we had drafted language to 
contemplate these occurances. I then asked Mark what would happen if there 
was a cut due to op constraints, and Mark explained that he would try to find 
another Buyer along the pipe. I probed further, and found that there would be 
no revision of the contract, nor a re-pricing of the transaction due to the 
re-scheduling. I then read Mark the language under consideration (making sure 
he understood that this was conceptual) and he agreed that the language 
provided for something that we are already doing operationally. Mark had 
never seen the language we propse for use for this Product. 

I think Logistics may have been issuing an opinion on their point without 
being fully aware of what we were attempting to offer, and I certainly don't 
blame them for doing so - as we all make decisions based on the information 
at hand.

I would like to proceed with this Product.

Dale

5/12/00

I spoke with Kevin Ruscetti, the trader, and Kevin has clarified for me that 
the product he intends to trade on ANR ML7 is NOT Interruptable gas, but 
rather subject to operational constraints like Socal Topock. He did request, 
however, that we make reference to secondary firm delivery.

Below please find the op constraints language that we use. I also added a 
secondary delivery blurb; please feel free to edit - and then I'll get this 
in front of Kevin for his review.


The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
the ANR Pipeline Company pipelines 
based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused 
nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm 
gas. In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints occur, Buyer 
may designate 
a secondary firm delivery location.

Subject: Sigma Factor Request (US Gas Phy Fwd Secondary Firm)

Matt or Frank,

Please provide a sigma factor for the following product type requested by 
Kevin Ruscitti:

US Gas Phy Fwd Secondary Firm

A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis.  The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the 
Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 
31 May 2001.
The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.  
The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery.  The 
volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational 
constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes 
are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an 
alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated.  
In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, 
the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or 
parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System 
constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.




Thanks,

CW

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the 
contract is signed by ENA..

I did get your email and my work number is 713-853-6320.  My home # is
713-880-4157.  I'll give you a call this weekend.  It's incredibly difficult 
for
me to talk at work so I'll give you a shout at home.   Talk to you soon.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for today and 
tomorrow
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled 'Total Reqs' contains the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further
notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on P:\Energy
Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy
elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved,

Stamas,

If you could only own one stock what would it be?  For me it would be EOG 
Resources - don't
ignore this one.

Friends,

Siddhartha, Nidhesh, and I are moving back home to Calcutta, India in April, 
2000.

Attached are our contact details.  I would have loved to contact each one of 
you directly but this has happened in a hurry and we have to pack, wrap up 
and leave Houston by April 20.  So please call to catch up and maybe plan a 
visit to Calcutta!

My work email and voicemail will remain active as I will be on a leave of 
absence from Azurix.  I will check them periodically.  Today is my last day 
at work. 

I hope that you will make to the happy hour that Gaby is planning next week. 
I would love to see you.

Regards,

-sheetal

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  today and
tomorrow  .    There are three worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the citygate delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is
archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to
save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily citygate volume relative to a prior value.  For the 
current
gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the 
previous
day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 
3/28,
then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The sheet labelled storage is for tracking our TCO storage injections (paper
injections).

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

It's time to say farewell. Next Thursday will be my last day at Enron, as I 
will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. Over the years, I appreciated 
the opportunity to work with, to learn from and get to know all of you and 
hope we can stay in touch (my email address is finanseer@hotmail.com). I hope 
those in Houston can join me at Solero's after work on Thursday, Sept. 7 
(Deffner's buying!!).

Take care,
Matt

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/18 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    NOTE:  THis worksheet omitted pending resolution
of issues related to TCO storage.

In what appears to be a rather unoriginal move these days, I've resigned from 
Mother Enron in favor of an early stage .com opportunity.  My last day will 
be this Friday, March 31st.

I'm not a fan of long goodbyes, so let me just say 'thank you' to each of 
you, for the part you played in making my two and a half years at Enron both 
memorable and rewarding.  My new employer (HomeWrite.com) is Houston-based, 
so with the glaring exception of Iaia, I hope to see each of you in the not 
so distant future. 

All my best,

Scott

p.s. Beginning Monday, April 3rd, I can be reached at:

Hope everything is going well.

Had a great time in SF.  Went to the wine country for a few days.  Was sad to 
come back
to Houston.  We haven't done much on the house since your visit.  I'll talk 
to you soon.  Tell
Marie we said hi.

Kevin,

Sound advice.  I do think I am in the regret stage, though.  I just can't
believe that she could be so clueless as to the state of the overall
relationship.  In the grand scheme of things, we got along extremely well.
I think I just need to break contact with her for a while.

I was laughing about the Campi issue.  After I read your email I vaguely
recalled through the memories of the alcohol induced haze that was your
wedding weekend hearing Pattie refer to Rich as Kampmann.  But, even if I
had remembered it while writing the email, I would have opted for a C vice a
K.  Thankfully, I never had to learn English as a second language.  I would
have sucked!

Though it was nice to dream of a Porsche 911, I, like a good engineer,
returned to my sensibilities to purchased a '99 Saturn SL2.  It is dark blue
with gray leather and only 7400 miles.  I really liked the customer service
aspect and figured I needed every support network I could at a time like
this.  The worst part is that both of my parents have Saturns so it seems
like an old person's car to me.

Speaking of support networks, my mom is in town for 11 days.  She is like a
built in maid service.  I didn't know the house could be this clean!

Take care,

Frank

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/17 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    Note: This worksheet not provided due to issues
related to TCO storage.

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the

The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.

Enron rating setup irks many workers 
By L.M. SIXEL 

TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses 
they're expecting next month. 

Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits 
them against each other. 

Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of 
five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will 
be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will 
be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" 
or "issues." 

An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the 
window." And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone." 

The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up 
with, are not based just on performance. 

Instead, they compare employee against employee. 

"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher 
level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current 
period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo 
from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that 
was distributed this month. 

While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also 
expected to be team players, according to the memo. 


`Horse-trading' of rank denied
The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the 
horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. 

Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering 
to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another 
employee. 

An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the 
manager he is working for, the insider said. 

Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no 
horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in 
stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom 
category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. 

But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect 
of bargaining. 

She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new 
system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the 
wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. 

Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known 
for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many 
employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. 

It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're 
getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human 
resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. 


Some may not fit in
Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's 
culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you 
have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in 
that environment. 

After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's 
recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't 
do well in an entrepreneurial environment. 

Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of 
favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. 

Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, 
dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the 
lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had 
T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3." 

Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how 
they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. 

But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- 
won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. 

And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent 
your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. 

"Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.

Hi Everyone,

I know that there is a whole bunch of you on the receiving end of this EMail
and we haven't seen or spoken to some in quite awhile but know this -- we are
thinking of you and your families!!  Our little (big?) Luke turned 4 months
today so I thought I would share some photos with all of you.  Although we 
have
been guilty of not staying in touch, I hope that the attached photos will 
allow
us to somewhat catch up with you.  It is certainly all about Luke on this end
of the line.  He is happy, healthy and so is Mom and Dad.  Here is hoping that
all is well on your end.  We hope to see everyone soon again some day but 
until
then we wish everyone all the best!

Love,

Todd, Rena, and Luke

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.  

Kevin

I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you 
can do it all.
Of course, after you assemble the chair.

Kevin,

How's things?  Been a while since we talked.  Hope your jobs are going well
and your wedding plans are proceeding smoothly.

Did you get my e-mail about running into Mary Eyre in the gym in San Mateo?
Spooky.  I've seen her a couple more times but I haven't spoken to her; I
get in the "properly pumped" zone.  Turns out there are a lot of classmates
on the peninsula - David Park, Frank Knifsend, Mary, and James Regan come to
mind immediately.

No real news here.  We haven't broken anything in the house in a while, so
either we're getting luckier or we're due.  Both jobs are very busy right
now so the weekends are for recuperating.  This weekend, of course, will be
for watching basketball.

Hi to Lisa - let us know how you're doing.

Regards,

Tim Sarhatt
Sr. Treasury Analyst

Kevin,

Great to hear from you!  I was beginning to think you had dropped off the
face of the earth.

I am getting on the boat in about 4 hours - midnight.  Actually, it's not
too bad that way as I go right to sleep when I get on.  I fly at night on
Saturday so I can sleep in.  Fortunately, I will only be on the boat for 18
days as we are conducting the exercise in Okinawa vice another country.
Hopefully, the situation in Taiwan won't deteoriate between now and when I
get off.

Great news about the house!  Send us some digital photos if you have them.
I think it is better to buy a house that needs some work as you are able to
get more home for the cash.  Also, it is easier to turn a profit if you
sell.  Not to mention having some projects in work is always a good hobby.

Marie and I came really close to making an offer on a beach house in Navarre
beach.  Fortunately, reason got the best of us and we are waiting until we
get back before we make such a monumental decision.  There are just too many
factors involved to make the decision from some digital photos.  So, are you
planning on staying in Houston for a while?

A smaller wedding sounds like a good plan.  To me, having a few close
friends present is always better than a bunch of strap hangers.  However,
most chicks would probably disagree.  Marie seems to have had no regrets
with our ultra small wedding.  Just let me know what you need me to do to
help pull it off.

If all goes well, we will start heading home in mid-June and settle in
around early August.  I will also be home for Erin's wedding in May.  We
will also be doing some house hunting in Pensacola at that time.  We will be
in the states from the 20th of May through the 9th of June.  Let me know if
you are available on the first or last weekend and we will stop in Houston
on the way in or out for a day or two.  The tickets we buy allow us four
stops anywhere in the US.

The only wild card in all of this is Test Pilot School.  I applied to the
board that meets in May.  If I get selected, I would go to Maryland instead
of Florida and it wouldn't be until mid-November.  If that happens, and I
actually hope it doesn't, we would either stay here for a few more months or
go to Md. early.  Either way, I will be at your wedding.

Glad to hear from you,

Frank

My address on the boat will be

conwayfp@belleau-wood.usmc.mil

Cherly,

I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC.  As a result, if 
you could take me off the Analyst/
Associate distribution list I'd deeply appreciate it.  Thanks and let me know 
if you have any questions or if you
haven't been notified of the promotion.

The attached file is an updated version of the one that I sent a few minutes
ago of the same name.   The changes are minor and are as follows:

*In the Daily Chg worksheet, the intraday change on BGE of +303 is all on
Choice+DCQ.  The original had 40 dth of the increase on Choice +DCQ and the
remaining 263 on EU 164, which was not correct.  No changes were made to the
volumes in the Total Reqs. worksheet which were correct in the original
version.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Nelson,
As you know, Grand Cheniere was under maintenance in October and we had to 
shut in Johson Bayou.   Francis wants us to reallocate (trespass gas) that 
they continued to flow onto ANR in the amout of  54,536mm to us  at an agreed 
upon price of $5.20.   ANR has agreed to do this next week.  Since you are 
out today Francis asked us to make sure you called him about this as well as 
another issue.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Kevin,
We're doing very well in Seoul.  It's been nearly a year since I first 
arrived, time flies.  We've had a frigid winter and it's just starting to 
thaw out now.  Work has been good, very challenging.  I'll be in Houston 
during the week of Feb 20th on business.  Why don't we plan to get together 
then.  I'll follow up.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/20  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are two  worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to 
get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that 
is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an 
increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates 
but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've 
just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis 
is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that 
state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate 
prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst 
of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  
If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to 
reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue 
likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so 
high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves 
by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak 
hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so 
many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the 
blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity 
and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national 
economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but 
I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care 
and thanks for the email.

Subject: Comments concerning Line Pack Gas Purchase Agreement form provided 
by Vector.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Having seen the trouble with the votes in Florida, I think this new more
technical ballot will help in the next election or if a revote is ordered.

Ahn-yong-ha-sae-yo Anderson team,
Looks like I'll be missing the fall recruiting activities in L.A.  I trust 
all is going well, and that we should continue our success at Anderson.  I 
would hope the dot com fever has died down somewhat, plus I think Enron has 
quite of bit of upside to offer candidates in that so much of what we do now 
is new economy without as much risk as a pure dot com.

Life in Seoul is working out quite nicely.   My wife Sunnie and I are finally 
settled into our townhouse in Sungbuk-dong, next to Pukhansan National 
Park.   Almost all of Korea is mountainous and we can find trails everywhere 
in and around Seoul.  Work is going very well.   I'm in charge of new 
business development at the SK-Enron joint venture so I've got my team 
working on about half a dozen initiatives.  I am currently busy preparing for 
the launch of a B2C website catering to consumers and their household 
needs.   I'm also leading a pilot project to lay some fiber optic cable along 
our gas pipeline network.  Summer monsoons have finally stopped, and we're 
looking forward to a trip down to Pusan during Chuseok (Korean 
thanksgiving).  Sunnie, daughter Heather and I spent a week in the mountains 
near Seoul, quite beautiful.    Let me know how the recruiting progresses, 
and also what's been going on in Houston.  

Cheers,
Jung

Julie,

If they want to pay $5.15, that's fine with me.  I do have $5.11 in the 
system but I could
have easily made a mistake.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Kevin

P.S.  Sorry it took me so long to reply.

The attached file contains our daily citygate volume requirements for   3/30
and 3/31         .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's
date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.    The AGL volumes in this file are not
up-to-date, so they should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

the power side of this transaction.  Besides the gas bid we talked about 
yesterday,
please come up with a back-up plan to price the gas on a fixed price basis 
just
in case it takes us another day to address any other concerns that John may 
have.

Thanks,
Ruth

Easter was great, how 'bout yours.  It was just me, Lisa and a friend of mine.
How's everything been with you?  How are the wedding plans coming?  Have
you seen Bruce lately?  How 'bout my brother?

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  today and
tomorrow .    There are three worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The 3rd sheet labelled TCO Storage relates to our daily swings on storage
injections.  We will be in touch with Chris regarding this.

Pilot 2 Participants!

Thanks again for participating in ClickAtHome's Pilot study.  We are very 
anxious to get started and are so excited to bring this incredible benefit to 
you!  We promised we would follow up this week, so here we are...  

Based on feedback we have received from Pilot 1, we are taking additional 
time to further integrate with our vendor websites and are expanding the 
vendor offerings to bring broadband coverage to more employees.  We 
anticipate ordering to begin in late December.  Please feel free to email us 
at clickathomepilot2@enron.com if you have any questions.  

Thanks again,
The ClickAtHome Project Team!

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin

All:

I just wanted to take a minute to bid you farewell.  This will be my last 
week at Enron as I have accepted a job with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and 
will be starting there next Monday.  I enjoyed working with each of you 
during my time at Enron and hope to keep in touch. I am not sure what my 
email will be at Kinder Morgan but you can always reach me at 
Dax_Sanders@yahoo.com.

Take care and stay in touch,

Dax

good points and yes the Dow just needs one more week like this to trade
under 9000 so 8000 is not a stretch.   Markets typically predict a recession
long before it arrives.  In the second q of this year you will see some sort
of headline that says Recession hits US.  I would buy that day.  As for
california, the worlds 6th largest economy,  energy is obviously your space
but I think that the calpines, capstones, and others are options such as the
contract they received last month.  Hope all is well.  Sweets party was fun.
It was only missing you and TJ. j

you obviously know the energy market better than most.  My guy at goldman,
Jonathan Raleigh, has been on calpine for 4 years and has killed it, so i'm
just following his lead. as for the futile leadership in ca, i agree.
wouldn't it be nice for you, me , tj, and sweets to run a company or a
state. j

Subject: CES Volumes for March 1 thru March 9, 2000

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just 
like Rena, huh?

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller 
does though.
Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

Attached please find the nipsco changes for the 20th.  Please note that there 
is a change on the ANR leg from 200 @ ANR/Ft Wayne to 141 @ ANR/Ft Wayne and 
59 @ ANR/Michigan City.   This will balance your Pool B and make you take the 
withdrawal on Pool A.   Otherwise you would be injecting on Pool B and 
withdrawing on Pool A.  


Total Demand:    Nominated  Difference

Pool A  936   859   (77)     
Pool  B  141   141       0

Total  1,077   1,000   (77)

Also, please note that all changes for 4/21 thru 4/24 are due to be nominated 
on 4/20/00 since Nipsco is closed for the holiday on Friday so if you are 
increasing or decreasing volumes over the weekend I need to have those 
numbers no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning.


Thanks,


Cora

                                            Subject:     A Texas Solution to 
the election




Looks like Maury and I will be moving back to Texas soon, based on the
following proposal....

Solution to the Election:

#1:  Al Gore becomes President of the United States (all 49
states).

#2:  George W. Bush becomes the President of The Republic of Texas.

Gore shouldn't mind as he said we were the worst state in the union
during the campaign.

So what does Texas have to survive as a Republic?:

NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).

We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States (that is why
Houston has problems with the air quality).

Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it).  The term "Don't mess
with Texas," will take on new meaning.

Oil - we can supply all the oil the Republic of Texas will need for
the next 300 years.

Natural Gas-Again we have all we need (too bad about those northern
states). Al Gore will figure a way to keep Tipper and you warm....

Computer Industry-we currently lead the nation in producing computer
chips.
A small place named Texas Industries, Dell Computer, EDS, etc., etc.

Health Centers-We have the largest research centers for Cancer
research, the best burn centers, and other large health planning centers.


We have enough colleges to keep us going:  UT, Texas A&M, Rice,
University of Houston, SMU, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University, etc.

We have a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we need
some more) and our friends across the border will pour in by the
thousands.

We have control of the paper industry, plastics, insurance, etc.

This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of
Texas afloat.

Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore:

Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only
President Gore will be able to drive around in his SUV which gets him
about 9  miles per gallon.  The rest of the United States will have to
walk or ride bikes.

You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off
your communications.

You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but since Al's
promised global warming, I'm sure you won't get cold!

You won't need our computer chips since you won't have electricity
to power the computers.

So don't worry about us down here in Texas.  We will be OK.

David J. Robinson, D. Min.
President
Houston Graduate School of Theology

Subject: I'll keep taking punches until their will grows  tired.

In 1974 the S&P 500 dropped 27% AFTER the first  rate cut by the fed.? In 
1981 it dropped 15% AFTER the first rate cut by  the fed.? With a S&P 500 
still trading at twice it's growth rate, 20 vs  10, a NASDAQ still trading at 
70 times earings, and a bullish advisor sentiment  still at 55%, the backdrop 
for a sharp rally isn't very good.? In a slowing  earnings enviroment I 
believe investors should focus on two sectors.? The  first are companies like 
Tootsie Roll Industries that manage to grow earnings  like clockwork.? 
Secondly, telecom/tech companies that are trading at their  growth rate and 
there is some assurrance that their customers are in a position  to keep 
ordering and paying for products.? For Tootsie Roll Industries it  is easy 
since the end user is the consumer and this products' consumption is  fairly 
recession proof.?? Efficient Networks' customers are SBC  Communications and 
others who then install their products to offer their  customer price savings 
that justify their capital investment. As long as SBC's  is financially 
strong and their ROI warrants the investment, the Efficient's of  the world 
appear to be interesting ideas.?  


? There will be layoffs not just in the DOT com world, probably everybody  at 
AMAZON, but also certain industries like the Financials and Auto's.?  This 
should remove once and for all any last Greenspan' fears of a wage led  
inflationary revival.? His comments yesterday were an admittance that this  
economy is softer than 14 feet of fresh powder in Montana.? Housing prices  
and financial assets were simply too inflated in general.? That doesn't  mean 
there aren't some good real estate markets and it doesn't mean there aren't  
any fair priced companies.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.   Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

T.J.,

I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the 
holidays or staying in LA?

Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.

Thanks,

Kevin

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Kevin

This is a message from Cindy Olson, Executive VP, Human Resource & Community 
Relations.

Please take a few minutes to complete the attached, very brief survey. Your 
input is important in helping determine future efforts in this vital area.

You have been randomly selected to participate in the second of an ongoing 
series of surveys that will be conducted to help us gauge how effectively we 
are leveraging diversity to enhance our organization.

As you know, Enron is engaged in a struggle to recruit and retain the quality 
of talent necessary to allow us to meet and beat our competition.  The 
business case for diversity is inarguable and we must step-up to the 
challenge of recruiting, developing and continually valuing an increasingly 
diverse workforce.  Such an effort requires that we look at diversity in a 
broader context that combines the different thoughts and ideas, life and work 
experiences, as well as skill sets of employees. It is this combination that 
will enable Enron to remain the leading innovator and one of the most admired 
companies in the world.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation and contribution.

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

DK

Kevin,

I recently saw that a Team Thadeus (fantasy baseball) original and one time
Philly - Kevin Stocker was cut by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  I'm sure you
were saddened to see one of the better players the Phillies put out at
shortstop get treated so rudely.  I hope all is well with Lisa and the
dogs.  What's the latest with the house hunting and the wedding plans?

Everyone here says hello.

Thanks.

Paul

Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/12  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.    Note that this worksheet is omitted pending

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/14  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'COMMENTS' contains a (partial) list of day-to-day changes and issues of note.

Kevin,

Siobhan let me know that she reached you last week.  Thanks for taking the
time to forward my credentials within Enron to their Wind operation.  I have
a resume and a general cover letter zipped to this email.

Just to let you know in case you speak with someone at Enron Wind, I sent a
"cold" resume about two weeks back for an opening in project sales/marketing
(Job codes 111363/111364).  They have many interesting projects on the table
and I am eager to talk with their recruiter about global openings.

Let me know if there is anything I must do to follow up or provide additional
information.  Thanks again for your help.

David

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

Subject: Is it safe?

Lower interest rates doesn't mean you can buy  companies with broken and 
unproven businessplans, Amazon.? It also doesn't  mean u buy the Wintel 
monopoly because the pc revolution has been over for a  couple of years.? I'm 
working on a liquid crystal display company called  Applied Films because I 
think screens are future, not laptops, not pc's or  hardware companies in 
general.? Lower rates will not save Xerox.? What  lower rates does mean is 
that if a company is hitting on all cylinders the  market may give it a 40 
price to earnings ratio instead of a 30.? It may  get the short sellers off 
our back on names like Nextlink, now called XO  communications whose business 
plan works but who needs lenders to open up their  wallets again and this 
time only to real companies, sorry Webvan, Priceline,  Pets.com, and of 
course Amazon.? If these lenders weren't so burned with  this paper they 
might still be lending to the internet infrastructure names like  XO and 
Teligent.? The trillion dollar question is will multiple  appreciation 
compensate enough for the earnings slowdown in the next quarter or  two.? For 
the autos I think not.? Remember my comments two months ago  about Auto 
layoffs around the corner.? Today GM announced Dec. sales down  almost 20%.
??? This is a critical time in the  market for investors.? If we can find 
stocks who won't be affected by an  earnings slowdown, McDonalds, then we 
should start to get some multiple  appreciation and therefore higher stock 
prices.? If Oracle grows at 40%  instead of 50% but the market starts paying 
higher multiples for strong  companies we could also see Oracle move higher.? 
And lastly for telecom  names that do have a sound strategy and management 
team,access to capital should  appear somewhere down this new horizon.
??? My suggestions are as follows:  My largest new position is a research 
fund by Goldman Sachs that closes to new  investors at the end of Jan.? 
Typically technology and financial stocks  lead the market when the FED 
begins easing like they did today.? This fund  is 25% in tech and 25% in 
financials with other names in the fund including  Merck, Philip Morris,Tyco 
and Enron.? The Goldman list was positive last  year even with such heavy 
tech exposure and a Nasdaq? market that was down  almost 40%. I feel it's a 
nice way to participate in a market that has been hit  hard.? The remaining 
positions may not be for everyone but here are some  suggestions
?
??? Libery Media Group
??? McDonalds
??? Oracle
??? Philip Morris
??? Echostar???  
??? XO Communications
??? Omnicom
??? JDS Uniphase
???? 
Aggressive Ideas:
??? BEA systems
??? Redback Networks
??? Efficient Networks
??? Applied Micro  Circuits
??? Sibel Systems
??? Openwave  Communications
??? Comverse Technology
??? Avanex

Chris--The attached file contains the daily changes for 3/27 and 3/28 in the
volumes of gas that we need by market area.  The daily changes are relative to
what we requested on a First-of-the month basis, which values appear in Col.
DD.   You can just open this file and print it out to see the magnitude of the
changes by market area or zone.  We'll be calling regarding pricing.

Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single 
one.  I heard
there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to 
you much
since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.

Attached is an updated version of the daily file that I sent earlier this
morning.  The only change is to the volumes for NIPSCO.  All other volumes
should be the same as those in the earlier version.  sorry for any confusion.


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 4/10/00 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.

Kevin Ruscetti would like to trade Physical Index transactions for delivery 
to ANR ML7 based on the above referenced Index. He tells me that it is widely 
known that delivery at ANR ML7 is secondary firm, and states that if allowed 
to transact on this the language would need to state that the parties would 
employ their 'best efforts' to deliver.

Joe - can you try and find me some Confirm language for this.

Comments, please.

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, "satisfactory", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=

I'm glad you had a great time.  It meant a lot to Lisa and me that you were 
able to spend
the entire weekend with us.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had so 
much fun.  I
hope you felt the same way.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Here is the draft procedures that I sent you back in September.  It does not 
incorporate the changes that you sent
us a few days latter.  I will forward a copy of that memo also.  We are 
looking forward to getting with you to discuss the 
procedures and timing.

Marty suggested that I get these discussions kicked off on your side while he 
was
out-of-town today.  Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures 
and made
a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up 
at the
correct time.

Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between 
Enron and
Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and 
costs so that we
both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this 
confirm form
to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the 
loop.

You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear 
understanding
of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's 
traders.  The timing
of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There 
will not be much
time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have 
the same
understanding what the numbers mean.

Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other 
things that need to
be included.

Thanks,

Ruth

Kevin - Just when you think it's safe to go back in the water!!  Mark Zwick 
at FirstEnergy called earlier.  I had called them last week after we found 
all the deals to make up for what they invoiced us for June's production.  We 
had some volume differences that Mark called to discuss.  On two of the deals 
(281431 and 308806), we have a total volume of 108,000 and 6,007 
respectively.  They invoiced us for 117,180 and 6,512. He claims our volumes 
are in mcf's and that if you apply the conversion factor of 1.085, you come 
up to his numbers.  The question is - who's right?? - Do we input mcf's in 
Sitara and if so, how can we get them adjusted to the dt's they invoiced us 
for?  And if our numbers are already in dt's, why does he think they're not?

The other thing is on deal #303253, we have a volume of 2,952 @ $3.26 where 
they invoiced us for 8,045 @ $3.835.  On this deal, he says our volume is an 
imbalance volume for MAY production (instead of June).  Could there still be 
another deal floating around out there for June's imbalance??  He says he got 
to that number by taking the total volume and subtracting out the other two 
deals (131,737 - 117,180 - 6,512 = 8,045).  He's supposed to be faxing me 
something to show that.  Would it be possible for me to bring that to you 
tomorrow sometime and maybe we can call him together to work all this out?

Sorry to keep harping on this but I'm sitting on a $600,000 receivable that's 
going to start drawing some attention.  Let me know if tomorrow afternoon 
would be convenient for you.

Thanks,
...Chuck

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

Kevin

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B

Alliance presented this to PGL when they were here on Tuesday (its the firm 
shippers primary deliver points).As an interesting note PGL interconnect will 
allow 600, but their system can't handle it.  We're working with our Canadian 
office to "buy" some of this alliance gas for PGL.  What we are looking at is 
reducing your baseload sale and part of their DIQ and replacing it with 
alliance gas.  We'll talk about it later.

Barbara,

I met with some people from Alliance Pipeline yesterday to discuss
nominations and confirmations.  Attached is a piece of information that
might be of interest to the daily group.  Could you route to the rest of the
group?

Thanks.

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Subject: Questions


Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?


There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Kevin

Kevin,

 I received a statement from Wisconsin Gas that shows what we received at the 
different points from Wisc. Gas.  My understanding on the deal that we have 
with EES is that we only buy from Wisconsin Gas what EES requests from us.  
On the statement, I can match up what is in our system for all of the points 
except for Willow Run (Michcon).  The Wisc. Gas statement is showing that we 
purchased 13,291 dth on August 16.  I did not see anything come through for 
EES at this location so I asked Julie Boehl in volume management to look into 
it.  She did not see a brokered deal entered for EES at Willow Run.  EES is 
showing purchasing 11,408 from us (they may be incorrect on their volumes) 
and we are not showing any sales that match to this volume.  Could you please

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Hey Kev,

Good to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  Well we out here in the Golden 
State
could certainly use some help from you and the boys at 
Enron...................
Gray Davis is a little mouse!  That about describes most peoples opininion of
him.  The power and natural gas situation out here is a mess!  The gas 
situation
is much worse for us at this point here in Long Beach.  We haven't seen any
power outages or any significant increase in our bill either.  The gas front 
is
an entirely different matter!  I just paid a $300 bill for the month of Dec.  
I
paid $100 for the same month in 1999.  The usage (therms) was the
same............ figure that one out?!?!  At that level I might as well be
paying for heating oil in Maine.  Most people I talk to have scene their gas
bill go up 2 or 3 fold.

Anyway, things could be a whole lot worse I guess.  Luke just had his 1st
birthday party this past weekend.  It was quite the scene.  I think his next
party will be when he is 18.  Say hello to Lisa for us.

TJ

What planet did Gray Davis come from??  What's the perception of this guy
in
California??  Hope all is well.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

Great to hear from you.  I'm glad you accepted the offer - I'm sure you'll
enjoy you're experience at Enron.  Good luck during your final semester.

Wow, what a gracious thank you.  I'm speechless.

Hope everything's been going well lately.  I'll talk to you soon.  By the way,
are you going to any events during Gas Fair?

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?
He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was
wondering how
the citizens of California viewed him.

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

Kevin

Kevin,

I can't remember the last time I was that relaxed!  On Sunday, Muggie asked
me in all seriousness if I had been smoking pot!

I spoke to a guy that said he spends 6-7k every 15-20k miles on ROUTINE
maintenance for his 911!  Unreal.  I have definitely scratched that one of
the list.

Looks like it is divorce court for this kid.  I can't believe it.  I am
actually disgusted by the whole affair.

How is that for an emotional swing in one email!

Have a great weekend!

Frank

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.     Note:  This sheet has been omitted from the
attached file for 04/11/00 pending resolution of issues related to TCO storage
with Chris Germany.

Chris and Kevin--The attached file contains our latest daily volume
requirements for 3/20 and the rest of March.   One caveat:  I have included
here the additional 150 dth/day into Piedmont off Transco for 3/21-3/31.
However, we are still waiting on a price quote from Chris for that volume.  If
we end up getting that gas elsewhere, I will send you a revised spreadsheet 
w/o
the additional 150dth/day into Piedmont.

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?  He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was wondering 
how
the citizens of California viewed him.  

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you 
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

Kevin

differentials as well.
Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying

Kev-it certainly sounds like you have alot on your hands with the house, but
i'm sure it will all work out.  Maybe you can call rabbit to come and do some
renovation work.  after all, he did spend his entire sophomore year building
the brothers bar!!  Or maybe give marro a call-he was the house manager and
pretty good with his hands.  Or better yet, give morgante a ring.  he won't
show up, but he'll take your wife out for a date.  By the way,
congratulations on getting married!!  Next time you come to NJ I'll give you
your present (it's on ice, don't worry)
    Yes I am still dating beth.  It's a little tough with the distance (as
i'm sure you can understand), but we do the best we can and when we see each
other it's always great.  We actually spent new year's down in mexico.
Matter of fact i picked up the rest of my pictures the other day and quickly
proceeded to become depressed at the fact that i am here and not there.
Needless to say we had a great time.  You know, we are figuring on taking a
trip sometime in the spring, maybe vegas.  it would be unbelievable if you
and lisa could meet us.  Or maybe we can even visit you guys.  let me know.
    I saw sweets new office recently.  He and i had lunch.  I'll tell you
something, he is such a great guy.  everytime i call him for anything, no
matter how long it's been since i've talked to him, he always acts like i
just spoke with him.  I have to fax you the letter he sent to me last year.
It was fucking hilarious.  Anyway, the office is great and i met one of his
new partners.  i'm sure they will do excellent there.
    I hope work is going well.  I'm keeping my eye on enron.  they are always
in the NY Times with some sort of inventive stuff that they're doing.  It
looks like a pretty cool company.  I also have a mutual fund that invests
heavily in the company.
    My work has been extremely hectic, but things couldn't be better.  My
partner pete and i merged our office with another guy on January 1 and now we
are a 3 partner firm.  We bought a building in Hawthorne and we close on
April 1.  I'm looking forward to getting into the building soon.  We have to
wait though for some renovations to be done.  But it should be pretty
exciting.  It's  a victorian house and it's a real nice setup.
    The only other person i have seen recently is coun.  He and Chris met
Beth and i for lunch a couple of weeks ago at the short hills mall.
Oh-before i forget, my number at work is (973) 569-0888.  Give me a call
soon, and give me your work number as well.
    Oh one last thing, give me moller's e-mail address if you have it.  And
something else, let me know next time you guys are road tripping to louisiana
or wherever else.  i am definitely in.
    Well take care, definitely stay in touch and by all means give the former
Ms. taggart my best.  It was great hearing from you.

Susan,

Could you please provide me with copies of the attached contracts.  I think 
you received a similar
request from Tom Donaho.  Contact me if you have any questions.   Thanks for 
your help.

Kevin

P.S. My desk # is 3234D and my telephone number is 3-6320.

Subject: Secondary firm delivery

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for 
EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 
2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, 
will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW
3-7533


A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to 
reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company 
pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused 
by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a 
failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may 
designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/10/00  and  
the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  3/29  and 3/30
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Sounds great.  Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.  I do 
not have anyone else's email,
but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.  Just 
ask him.  Let me know if you need anything
else.

Thanks,

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Dear Amazon Customer,

As someone who has purchased books about World War II and the men
and women who fought it, you might like to know about two recent
releases: "Our Finest Hour: The Triumphant Spirit of America's
World War II Generation" and Andy Rooney's "My War." These two
books, along with three related history titles, are now available
at 40% off. You can order your copies by following the links below:

"Our Finest Hour"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883013984/
"Life" magazine boasted an uncommonly talented roster of writers
and photographers during World War II. "Our Finest Hour" features
the images and reports that brought home to American readers the
horrors of that distant war, and also documents the efforts on the
home front. This selection of photographs and extended captions
from the pages of "Life" and other contemporary publications
gathers images that have become part of American iconography.

Andy Rooney's "My War"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586480103/
Andy Rooney's "My War," a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir,
recounts his experiences as a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes,"
where he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such
fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin.

And, save 40% on these popular World War II-related titles:

"Flags of Our Fathers"
by James Bradley and Ron Powers
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553111337/

"The Greatest Generation"
by Tom Brokaw
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375502025/

"The Greatest Generation Speaks: Letters and Reflections"
by Tom Brokaw
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375503943/

Leroy,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you - I actually 
am just catching up

Congrats Murli,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job 
at Enron.
I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the 
Communications
group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would 
be better
at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 
(W) and
we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate 
brokers to refer you to.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

TEAM CARLTON MAILBOX : ATTENTION MIKE DENZEL

We have received your acceptance and you are confirmed for ClickAtHome Pilot 
2.

You will be notified with an e-mail by November 17th on how and when you can 
access the ordering web site. Ordering is not expected to
begin until December. 

As a pilot participant, you will be testing various aspects of this new 
program such as the program offerings, program communications, product and 
service ordering, vendor services and program support.  At this time, the 
pilot program is not intended to provide access to Enron's network for 
telework purposes.   If you need Enron access for business reasons, please 
continue to maintain your existing computer and connection for this purpose.  
 In advance, we appreciate your co-operation and patience under this pilot 
program.  

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  By participating the Pilot, 
you are not obligated to order hardware or connectivity, but will be given 
the opportunity to review your options and associated prices.

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on our web site.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot web site is available.  After agreeing to the 
Pilot Participants Agreement and reviewing these materials on the web site, 
you may choose to defer ordering until the All Employee roll-out in early 
2001 if you wish.

Please send any questions to the clickathomepilot2@enron.com mailbox.

Thanks.

Subject: EPNG Blanco NonBondad

David,

Could you take a few minutes to review the attached new location EPNG 
NonBondad.  Tori Kuykendall from the west desk has told us she wants the same 
language that SoCal Topock has due to the fact that the EPNG NonBondad 
section of the pipeline has a history of breaking down and being interrupted 
all the time.  

Thank you,

Melba

Existing:
EPNG SoCal Topock
The transaction is for delivery at the Southern California Gas Company -  
Topock interconnect with El Paso Natural Gas.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
both El Paso Natural Gas and Southern California Gas Company pipelines based 
upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to 
receive or deliver firm gas.

New:
EPNG Blanco NonBondad
The transaction is for delivery at El Paso San Juan Blanco non-Bondad.  The 
volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal 
operational constraints on El Paso Natural Gas Pipelines based upon 
historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these constraints 
are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or 
deliver firm gas.

and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20

Great to hear from you as always.  It'll be great to have you 
back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys.
I hope it comes across OK.

Talk to you soon.

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.

IN SPORTS TODAY:

After failing to secure a win via a recount of points, the Tennessee Titans
(6-7) are now demanding to replay the final down of their recent 42-41 loss
to the Dallas Cowboys (7-6).  Titan team officials explained that Titan
fans
intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that
replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials
that the ball did not pass thru the uprights.  Titan team officials added
that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn)
on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay
of the down.  Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the
uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials.  They
added that Cowboy kicker Tim Seder (R - Arkansas) successfully kicked thru
the same uprights during the game from distances of 47, 42 and 36 yards.

Hi Kevin,

I tried to call you at work today, but you had already left.  I then tried
to call you at home but I have an old or wrong ph#.
I just wanted to say that I am so sorry I can't come to the wedding.  I was
actually coming by myself, because EVERYONE we asked to baby sit, couldn't
for that Saturday.  I was really looking forward to it.

The problem is that I am having problems with my episiotomy from the
delivery.  It has not healed properly and I am still having pain.
I won't know until my appointment next week, but the doctor said that I have
to go back in the hospital and get re-cut and re-stitched, and then I have
to wait to heal all over again.   I don't know all the details, but I am
assuming it will feel the same as it did just after the baby.  I was told I
couldn't do much of anything for about 2 weeks.  I asked to have the
procedure early, but they said I have to wait to heal completely or it may
not be strong enough to hold the stitches.

John's Baptism is on Oct 1, and my parents are coming up, so I need to have
it done 2 weeks prior to that, which puts your wedding right in the middle.
The  doctor said there was a slight chance it could heal on it's own, but it
is doubtful.

I just wanted to let you know that I am so bummed that I won't be there.  I
was so psyched to see Rich, Frank, Kampy and your family.   I'll let you
know if anything changes, but for now it looks like I'm going to miss the
most important day of your life!!!

Give me a call (856) 797-1398.

Thanks,
Karen

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.
 P. O. Box 4428
 Houston, Texas 77210-4428
 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk
 Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816.

That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

KR

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it.

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Kevin

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3
(Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with
today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not
current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Dude,
Didn't really have a chance to tell you how great it was to see you again. It 
was way too long and we should not wait another three years to get together 
again. I can promise you that Mr. Moller will not be drinking piss the next 
time we are out. I don't have your work number, so why don't you send it to 
me or call me in the office at 973 367-7150. Tell Lisa I send my best and let 
me know the next time you are back in Jersey with some time to kill.

Dear Mr. Tagert:

Thanks for a great weekend.  Everything was great.  Hope you had a good
trip home.  Give my regards to Lisa.  Let's talk, seriously this time,
about a weekend for me to come down and visit.

Duude,
What's happening? Finally getting around to getting
you my new email and tele #. I left Pru back in
mid-December and have been running non-stop with the
new job. It is a world of difference going from Corp
America to a start-up, but its been fun.

Been doing some traveling and spending a lot of time
trying to get new customers and servicing the ones we
sign up.

So how was N.O.? I'm sure that the three of you didn't
do any drinking or got into any trouble.

Tell the lovely Mrs. Ruscitti that we say hello. Don't
forget, let me know the next time you are in Jersey
and if you have time we should hook up.

I had bookmarked Mr. Conway's email on my computer at
Pru and forgot to take it with me, can you send it to
me. Thanks and talk to you soon,

=====

Hey Kevin,
We understand you will be coming home in a few weeks.
Do you know the exact date, or did my husband just not tell me?
I'm testing out my email ability since Lisa was able to give me your address
last night.
We're glad to hear all is going well and the the house will be completed
sooner than expected!

Enjoy the heat!!!! Gloria

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   3/31 thru 4/3
.    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date contains 
the
volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.   The 
schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Brett,

I thought I had your home phone #, but I only have your work #.  As a result,
I didn't call you this weekend.  Send me your home # so I can give you a ring.

By the way, Happy 35th birthday.  I hope you had a good one.

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/19  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are two  worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

We will be in town.  It would be great to see you and Marie.  Sorry for the 
delayed response,
I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.  I hope you could make 
it out.  I'll check 
into some things to do.

Let me know.

Kevin
