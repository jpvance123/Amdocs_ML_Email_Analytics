Kevin,

I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts.

This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC.

Dave

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times=20



By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/rbellrgb100border.jpg>

Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i=
n response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje=
ctions, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing it=
s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=
 minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone =
ahead.=20

Analysis: Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in=
 seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent si=
nce May 1, 2001. But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is =
its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week=
 to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts. E=
arlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off =
on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Com=
pany, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market=
 conditions improve.=20

The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for=
ces. Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the =
California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons fo=
r dropping its company-separation plans. The company said it would now focu=
s on using its "single" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate=
 in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United S=
tates. "What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that co=
mes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) i=
s the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new=
 power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound. The world has changed,=
'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference =
call with the media.=20

The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly. The company will pay=
 Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreem=
ent, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $19=
6 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business conti=
nued. Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cau=
se the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quart=
er. The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. Gol=
dman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the=
 investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy=
 trading and marketing business. In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.=
5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryl=
and deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a sepa=
rate trading company. Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be =
part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain togeth=
er.=20

It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=
 significant announcements concerning its future plans. Mayo A. Shattuck II=
I was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001. =
Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Ban=
c. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the =
past seven years. On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said i=
t would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating s=
tation in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million. Constellation=
 Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group. As part of the sale, =
Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed =
prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nin=
e Mile 1 is not extended.=20

The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul=
k of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny. Constellation's domesti=
c merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per sh=
are of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher =
than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share i=
n earnings for the same quarter. Allegheny Energy reported that their third=
-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the=
 acquisition of a trading and marketing unit. Allegheny's third-quarter ear=
nings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and=
 beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share. Allegheny is confi=
dent that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 =
to $4.10 per share.=20

Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe=
rcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days. The drop i=
n energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pric=
es. Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny'=
s 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price a=
ssumptions.=20

The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e=
arnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov=
er. Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for s=
plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =
can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and soften=
ing wholesale market prices. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amr=
o, said there are common themes affecting the industry: "One is lower power=
 prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower sto=
ck prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth."=20

AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees. Its earnings fell for a second co=
nsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and=
 said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out s=
elling off assets. AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES =
was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term c=
ontract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term =
contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of fla=
t growth. Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were =
very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their p=
roduct. But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to=
 the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one yea=
r ago in many parts of the country.=20

The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu=
ndamental shift in the electric business. Their actions are, in some respec=
ts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabil=
ity in their power supply costs, profits and operations. Perhaps most signi=
ficantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to w=
hether or not they will continue to be an integrated business. As Constella=
tion concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business=
 is to remain an integrated company. We would not be surprised if others co=
me to the same conclusion.=20

The European model, one of the "major four" models the market analyzes is in
and it shows generally mild conditions for much of the eastern interconnect
through the end of next week.
In fact, through at least 10 days, and probably beyond, this particular
model shows no sign of any major intrusions of cold air into the eastern
interconnect.

For the tropical feature in the Carribean, it brings the storm up along the
West Coast of Florida, just east of all the production areas this weekend
and stalls it out over the Southeast early next week meaning some rain
there.

We'll need to re-evaluate all of the models in the morning for the long
term, but at least for this evening this is a bearish weather picture
through next week from the European model.

See you all in the morning.

Dave

Have you been turned down from receiving a 
loan by a bank because of poor credit, no 
credit or bankruptcy?

Private Foundations are not interested in 
credit ratings, only demonstrated need.

IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE A GENUINE NEED, YOU 
CAN APPLY FOR A GRANT!

It is much easier to receive a grant by mail 
from a Private Foundation than a local bank, 
because they are much more lenient. Imagine 
getting a check, payable to you, in the mail! 
Money you never have to pay back!

WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW!

1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.   

2.  I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise
