Hi UT Team - 

We're in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended and we need to make sure they're accepted!  In order to ensure 
cultivation of the UT candidates who received offers, we have assigned each 
of you to a team of candidates to call at least once before the Holidays.  

The teams are designed so there is an executive lead, an experienced Enron 
representative, and/or an associate.  All members of the cultivation team 
should contact each candidate assigned to their team each week.  If the 
executive leads want to develop a more detailed strategy for their 
cultivation team that is fine.  Each week the associate should report to me 
about the candidates on their team, letting me know about any issues or 
concerns.

The deadline for offer acceptance has been extended to January 2nd!  Please 
communicate this to all candidates and make sure to let them know if the 
paperwork is not in our office by January 2nd we will assume they are 
declining.

If you have any questions or do not feel that you have the time to devote to 
this, please let me know so we can replace you.  I really appreciate your 
help!  Don't forget to call everyone at least once before the Holidays, 
because they will be leaving campus for Christmas break soon!

Team #1:       Candidates:
  Lead -  David Haug    Niraj Parikh  512-401-8530
   Thomas Suffield   Monique Salazar 512-474-1974
   Ellen Fowler    Todd Preheim  512-799-8981
   Kyle Kettler    Jonathan Mueller 512-342-2531
   Paul Broderick    Roman Stephens 512-444-5480
   Mark Gandy
   Jennifer Martinez
   Peter Hayes
   John Massey
   Gwynn Gorsuch

Team #2:       Candidates:
  Lead -  Shawn Cumberland   Nadeem Abdullah 512-457-1511    
   Gary Hickerson    Scott Conner  512-338-9581
   Ben Glisan    Thomas Dalton  512-527-9808

   Jeff Bartlett
   Ross Mesquita
   Sean Keenan
   David Mitchell

To the best of my knowledge we have had no acceptances or declines from UT 
but if you have more up to date information please past it my way.

If there is a member of the team I have left off the distribution list and 
wants to participate please let me know.

Thank you again,

Hey guys,

The meeting today will be at 4:30 in EB751.  EES is fine with accepting the 
gas in storage - with no fallback position.  This is largely due to the fact 
that we are in the middle.  We are accepting the gas in storage, so EES 
really has no choice.  However, they are starting to show some concern for 
swing and true-up volumes.  My thought at this point is that since they are 
receiving the gas in storage, there is no need to worry about swing - it can 
fit in the storage with the rest of the gas.  This may cost something, but it 
should not cost as much as a put.

EES also wants daily as opposed to first of the month delivery.  That's about 
it.  See you at 4:30.

Andrew

Andrew,

Note conference room for our meeting today.  I'm also attaching a brief 
writeup of the deal so far from our perspective.  You might want to review 
before our meeting so you will know where our current understanding (or 
misunderstanding :-)   )  of the deal currently is.

Thanks,

Charlie

I just had a request from the City of Pasadena for our offer ( indication 
only) for $10 calls for Socal Border for Q3.  I would say the volume, if it 
matters, would only be about 2,000 MMBtu/day.  At the money looks like about 
$9.70.

Thanks,

Kim

ps I will not talk to this customer again until monday.

If we can't get Wilkerson, Hightower (both Top 5 nationally) and a decommit 
or two from Texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are 
indeed pathetic salesmen. These guys can come in and start as redshirt frosh 
if not play as true freshmen, even though RC likes to redshirt all OL'men.

I would like to announce the following management changes within the Analyst 
/ Associate Program, which are effective immediately.

Traci Warner will assume responsibility for Recruiting for the Western 
Hemisphere.  Traci joined Enron's Associate Program in 1995 and has held 
positions in Business Development, Origination, and Public Relations at Enron 
Energy Services, Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services.

Ted Bland will assume responsibility for Career Development (including 
rotations) for the Western Hemisphere.  Ted has been with Enron since 1989 
and has held several roles in Origination and Business Development within 
Enron Wholesale Services.  Most recently, Ted was assigned to the 
commercialization of some activities within Human Resources.

Anna Jansson, who is based in London, will continue to lead all efforts for 
the Associate / Analyst Program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Anna has been 
with Enron Europe for the past three years and, most recently, has been 
responsible for setting up the EBS Human Resources function in Europe.

Please join me in working with Traci, Ted and Anna to ensure the success of 
this important program.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President, Analyst / Associate Program

I spoke with Doug Leach regarding your questions.  He has already contacted 
4-5 suppliers/truckers and is ready to rock and roll when we know what spec. 
of No. 2 we need.  As such, they are all set to supply our requirement.  Doug 
reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want 
to build with a supplier.  He is particularly concerned if the plant switches 
to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a 
logistical nightmare.  


He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by 
buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).  However, 
his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) 
as a result of gasoline prices cooling off.

He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.  We should get results in the 
next several days.

something I am totally comfortable with.  However, upon reviewing the=20

of these kids' futures.

Subject: JA Company Program


Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

Judy Wirzberg

Charles,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas 
meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may 
have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there 
may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and 
we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little 
higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one 
should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in 
California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the 
producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas 
owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only 
vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You 
could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, 
which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I 
have.

Mat

Subject: RE: Responses to your questions on fuel oil for Fort Pierce facility

Mark -- 

(1)  We can use the MHI turbine specs that we have now.  The turbine team 
will be telling everyone that final specs (on everything in the turbine 
contract) will not be final for a while, so you have to use what is available 
now.  In reality, not much will actually change.  Just use their current oil 
spec sheet.

(2)  We have the opportunity to sell more than 200,00 gallons now, but we 
need a price to work the extra deal.  

(3)  If extra time for filling is desired (as in a put), then let me know the 
parameters, and I will try to get it agreed to.  Starting to fill on time is 
important, but if we take some extra time to finish, that might be okay.

(4)  Regarding the comment about not wanting too many trucks lined up and 
causing traffic congestion, there is room in two spots near the plant to 
"stage" a series of trucks.  If this info would be useful, let me know.

Subject: Responses to your questions on fuel oil for Fort Pierce facility



Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. 
King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).  We have answers to all questions 
except the quality specifications of the fuel oil.  We expect an answer on 
the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether 
the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our 
quality specs).  We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the 
engineers.

How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon 
order?

Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and 
to review any additional questions.  Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at 
x57229 with any questions.

Thanks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------


1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   

 The delivering trucks will require pumps.

2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     

 The line is 3"


3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings?    

 Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings.


4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    

The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from 
Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl 
the MHI requirements are known.

5) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?  

 Someone is always on duty at plant so deliveries can technically be made on 
a 24/7 basis.  The plant manager did say he would like to avoid a long line 
of trucks out the plant in order to maintain good relationships with the 
neighbors.


6) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  

 At this point we are only replacing the 200,000 gallons of oil we had Fort 
Pierce burn in order to empty their old tank and allow us to clear that 
location for our plant.  Additional oil may be purchased later (next year) 
after development plans are further along.


7) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   

 The plant requires non-Dyed fuel.


8) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   

 Coastal was the previous supplier to the plant.


9) Design a fuel resupply plan including pre-purchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods

  Such a plan appears to be premature at this point but we will review the 
issues with you at a later date.

10) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   

  Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record.

11) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  

  We are looking for a firm fixed price bid for filling the tank, unless you 
would recommend otherwise.

12) Commercial start date of plan     

  The tank will be finished and available for fill on 5/15/2001.

13) Any other issue to be discussed

  None that we are aware of.

I would recommend selling Intel today. It is up with the market this morning 
even after a bad announcement.  The fundamentals for anything PC related

The Northern Border guys would like to recognize their $500,000 in earnings 
associated with  the Kern Capacity that they syndicated in the 3rd Quarter 
and make it part of the Master Service Agreement between ENA and Crestone.  
This is the document that they proposed.  We should recognize some additional 
float given the lag in the payment date.  Gerald can you approve this from a 
legal standpoint?

The taxes that you owe will be based on any gain on whatever we sell.  It 
will be much less than $2000.  For instance, if we bought $1500 of Enron 
stock that is noe worth $2000 then you will only pay tax on the $500 gain.  
I'll look at it tonight.

Subject: Update of Fuel Oil Analysis

Team,

Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so 
fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is 
we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months 
and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the 
specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from 
Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must 
meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review 
process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any 
questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.

Thank you,

Matthew Tezyk

UT Team,

I just got word that Monique Salazar and Nadeem Abdullah have already 
accepted the offer to come to Enron.  So please call and congratulate them 
rather than cultivate.
The only formal decline we have received is from Scott Conner, so unless you 
would like to try and sway him to Enron there is no need to contact him.

Also for clarification - if you have a candidate name next to your name in 
the team roster please contact only that candidate.  (Ex. David Haug will 
only call Niraj Parikh)  If you do not have a candidate name next to your 
name please call all the candidates on your team list. (Ex. Jennifer Martinez 
will call all 5 candidates on her team)  The hope is that these candidates 
will feel a sense of belonging and want to come to Enron.  The candidates 
will appreciate someone from Enron who takes the time out to call and it 
shows our people care.  

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me anytime.

Kristin

Subject: UT Candidate Cultivation

Hi UT Team - 

We're in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended and we need to make sure they're accepted!  In order to ensure 
cultivation of the UT candidates who received offers, we have assigned each 
of you to a team of candidates to call at least once before the Holidays.  

The teams are designed so there is an executive lead, an experienced Enron 
representative, and/or an associate.  All members of the cultivation team 
should contact each candidate assigned to their team each week.  If the 
executive leads want to develop a more detailed strategy for their 
cultivation team that is fine.  Each week the associate should report to me 
about the candidates on their team, letting me know about any issues or 
concerns.

The deadline for offer acceptance has been extended to January 2nd!  Please 
communicate this to all candidates and make sure to let them know if the 
paperwork is not in our office by January 2nd we will assume they are 
declining.

If you have any questions or do not feel that you have the time to devote to 
this, please let me know so we can replace you.  I really appreciate your 
help!  Don't forget to call everyone at least once before the Holidays, 
because they will be leaving campus for Christmas break soon!

Team #1:       Candidates:
  Lead -  David Haug    Niraj Parikh  512-401-8530

Charlie, I don't know if you'll have any plans for the superbowl but if
you would like to come to Galveston you are more than welcome.  We will
be at Pop's house - Jimmy's brothers will be there - we are going to
plan the menu this evening but last night Mitchell and I decided some
nice heavy h'or'dourves (sp?) might be nice - and anything Mitchell
cooks is really worth the dive.  Anyway let me know.  Love, Margaret

This announcement just came out from TCPL:

Planned Expansion of Alberta and B.C. Systems

 On February 21, 2001, TransCanada informed existing customers holding firm 
service transportation
 at the Alberta / B.C. Border Delivery Station and/or the B.C. System that we 
were in the process of
 assessing the feasibility of an expansion of the Nova Gas Transmission Ltd. 
[NGTL] and B.C. systems.
 TransCanada had received inquiries regarding the potential for expansion of 
new firm delivery service 
on the NGTL System at the Alberta / B.C. border [A/BC], and on the B.C. 
System from A/BC to the
 interconnect with PG&E GT NW [GTN], at Kingsgate B.C. / Eastport, Idaho. 
These inquiries had been 
driven primarily, but not exclusively, by the GTN open season for additional 
capacity into the Pacific 
Northwest, and California.

As part of the feasibility assessment, customers with contracted capacity 
expiring beyond November 1, 2002
 who wished to turn back capacity were asked to inform us of their requests. 
This would form part of a capacity
 rationalization process. Customers currently holding one year re-newable 
contracts were asked to inform us
 of their plans to turn back capacity after November 1, 2002.

As well, all existing customers were asked to provide information concerning 
their plans to extend their
 contracts beyond the current expiry date as well as their estimate of any 
additional firm service requirements
 they may have, in excess of their firm contracts, on our west-path systems. 
This solicitation was also
communicated to other parties. This information was to be provided to 
TransCanada by March 12, 2001.

Based on these solicitations, TransCanada has received significant 
incremental queuing requests in both
 the NGTL and B.C. System queue. Upon receiving signed contracts, TransCanada 
plans to seek regulatory
 approval to expand our Alberta System by up to approximately 227mmcf/d of 
incremental capacity and
 expand our B.C. System by up to approximately 216 mmcf/d of incremental 
capacity.

We are currently tendering precedent agreements for ABC Border and B.C. 
system capacity to expansion shippers,
 based on queue priority. These customers will have until April 2, 2001 to 
return these agreements. Once
TransCanada has received these executed agreements, we will proceed with the 
appropriate processes, including
 regulatory approval, to ensure an on stream date of November 1, 2002.

If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact 
Don Bell at [403] 920.5560,
 don_bell@transcanada.com.

Following our Ft. Pierce meeting this morning, Ozzie Pagan's called me and 
requested a "physical basis" offer for the following deal.  This request is 
the answer to the question David Fairley was going to ask the power guys.  
Neither the FGU RFP  nor the current Ft. Pierce supply option will impact the 
deal's need for this offer.   

Term:  (1) 6/02 - 5/03 (the proposed phase 6 in-service date)
  (2) 6/02 - 12/03 (phase 6 delay insurance)

Quantity: 37,000 MMBtu/d (est. based on 200 MW @ 7,700 HR)  

Location: at the plant

If you have any questions, please ask.  

Regards,
Ed

Hi guys,

Please treat this as strictly confidential

Please take action ASAP

As you all know, the Enron Associate 2001 offers haven't been very popular 
among MBAs. Given the fact that December is decisions month and that, given 
the company growth, we cannot afford lose a new breed of highly qualified 
people, the following has been decided:

Present a proposal to Jeff Skilling today in order to improve the current 
offers. The proposal will be presented this afternoon, after two 
Associates-Skilling-HR interactions (in which Skilling expressed more than 
once his concern about Enron offers being so low compared to the market 
...I-Banks, Consulting firms).

Select one alumni per B-School represented in the 2000 Associate Class, you!

Authorize those representatives to send a standard e-mail (text provided 
below) to the candidates who got offers in their respective B-Schools, in 
order to gain some time until the official HR communication (hopefully caring 
good news) is submitted.

The standard e-mail should read EXACTLY as follows (we are not authorized to 
change or add anything):

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

To MBA students considering joining the Enron Associate Program,

I wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that a proposal to change 
the Associate compensation package has recently been presented to Jeff 
Skilling.  A decision concerning the recommended change is expected in the 
next few days.  More information will be provided as soon as possible.  Have 
a nice weekend!

Regards,

Representative Signature

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

We are asking you to the send the e-mail under your name because we want this 
notification to be informal. We have the authorization to do it this way.

In case you are contacted by any candidate, the offical position should be 
consistent with the one in the e-mail: a decision is expected very soon, we 
will let you know asap.

Please bcc me when you send the message, since it is important to keep track 
about which B-School candidates have been notified.

Thanks a lot for your help and quick response,

Roberto Conterno

I figured you were exhausted so I didn't call - I hope Melissa and Hunter are
better.  I have updated your address and they made me update my pin number - 
it
is 68966896 - they now have to be 6-8 digits.  I got my new subscription today
- it is really neat - thank you.  Also, for tax purposes am I right in 
thinking
that I will only have to claim $2,000 as earned income since that is all we
moved - the year before it was much more and I had to pay taxes.  Let me know.
Love, Margaret

Okay the results are in, and they are ugly.
 Enron's offer acceptance rate from UT was a whopping 2 candidates this year.

This is out of 9 offers extended!


I sent an email hoping to spike interest in the UT team to go to Austin, 
generate interest in first year candidates and to have fun over a few toddies 
before interviews.

So far I have had no confirmed response for this event.  Please keep in mind, 
for this to be a successful Spring recruiting season the participation of 
team members is needed.  Even though a major complaint from candidates was 
our salary ranges, I also feel the team and I did a poor job of candidate 
cultivation. Campus recruiting is fun, but it also takes dedication and team 
work.  We must really show a strong presence on campus this Spring in order 
to show the candidates how exciting Enron truly can be.  Part of the 
attraction for any candidate is to work for a company whose employees have 
fun attitudes and personalities.  I know most of you possess these attributes 
so lets take that to campus and get some awesome intern candidates!

In order to help solve the schedule problems that some of you expressed I am 
changing the date.  Please see below:

What:  First Year Candidate Cultivation and Targeting Opportunity

When:  Tuesday, February 6th

Where:  Scholz's Bier Garten, or Fado Irish Pub

Time:  7:00pm to ?

We will hold this event on a Tuesday since we can partner it with the Eyes of 
Texas Career Fair and because the closed list is due 2 days later.  The whole 
purpose of this event is to gather names of interested and qualified 
candidates and to get Enron's name back on campus.

*  If you are able to attend the Eyes of Texas Career Fair as well that event 
will begin at 2pm and end at 5:30pm. 

If you are interested and/or have suggestions on how to make this event more 
successful please contact me immediately.  



Thank you,

Kristin Gandy

FYI.  The email below changes things for years 4 & 5 because we would need to 
have gas for the summer months.

Charlie - please proceed with getting the pricing as we talked about, but 
also try to get pricing for more of a firm service (instead of best efforts) 
for Summer '05 and '06.  What is the gas availability outlook for this time 
period?

Thanks.

I wanted to check with you on one issue on the Midway pricing request 
currently at the desk.

The interruptible provision should be for the following profile:

 Years 1, 2, & 3 1,000 hours per year
 Years 4 &5 500 hours per year

This is the profile of allowed oil back-up operation under the project's air 
permit.

Is this profile consistent with the pricing request we discussed with Charlie 
yesterday afternoon?

Let me know.  I wanted to check this before they give us pricing back.

Sorry I did not get to call last night.  I'll try tonight after 8:00.

Can you please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-6666 and update my address?
Your duplicate statements have been going to my old address in Austin.  My 
new address is 13006 Brayton Court, Houstno, TX 77065.

You will also need to sell $2000 of stocks in your Bidwell account and make 
your 2001 IRA  contribution to this IRA account as we have done the last 
several years.  We'll talk about what to sell later.

Love,

Subject: Ft Pierce

A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King 
Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings? 

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)
9) Commercial start date of plan
10) Any other issue to be discussed

Did I leave anything out?

Subject: Re: ICAP?  

ICAP is installed capacity.  You sometimes hear it referred to as RegCap 
(regulatory capacity).  In some of the northern markets you must demonstrate 
that you have enough capacity (ICAP) to cover your max peak.  This capacity 
doesn't necessarily have to be used to serve your load  (This is the most 
confusing part).  If you owned a plant, you could sell the ICAP and energy 
off that plant to two different counterparties.  What Kevin's is pointing out 
that the FL RTO will require ICAP, therefore, if we owned steel in the 
ground, we would receive the benefit of being able to sell the capacity AND 
the energy.  

Not all of the markets require ICAP, therefore, it is good to clarify what 
people mean when they use the word capacity.  In some markets, the capacity 
price is imbedded in the energy price.  Capacity is a very loosely used term 
in the electricity industry.    I am sure this is clear as mud.  It's kind of 
hard explain in an e-mail.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Can you explain ICAP (and why we would get paid for it) to a dumb gas guy?  I 
have heard it several times and read it in the Ft. Pierce e-mail.

Todd,

Thanks for the info.  I may need some help decoding the info so we can get 
exact durations for warnings.  However, I think we should wait until we get a 
genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more 
time on this.   It's definitely good that we have this data though should we 
need it.   Pre-1963 is probably not necessary at this time.


Thanks,

Charlie

John,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas 
(9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the 
following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the 
CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The 
desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side 
of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    
It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the 
TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) 
size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie

I talked to Jared Friday about capacity for the Ft. Pierce plant and Jared 
said that he thought the gas desk and the power desk (Scott Neal, Rogers 
Herndon and himself) should discuss  the gas supply for the Ft. Pierce and 
other Florida projects.  Could you guys set something up?  Please let me

Mark,

Les has worked up some economics on transport regarding Elba.  He would like 
to have some pull down buttons for fuel, zone, gri, etc. to look at different 
netbacks.  He is continuing to revise this but this is the first start.   
Whoever is working on this needs to get an overview from Les and I so they 
understand what we are looking for.

Thanks.

I am going to add some sheets this A.M., so if Mark is going to get someone 
to work on it, the individual should go thru what I have done, determine what 
improvements can be made, then contact me.  I will send the latest version to 
them, then they will take over full control.

Subject: Enron Weather Derivatives

Dave,

Thanks for taking time to talk with me the other day.   To recap what I was
asking you to consider, we at  Enron currently have two different weather
derivative products under development that we believe could be of interest
to Dupont.   One of the products involves protection against
hurricane-related production disruptions.  The exact form of the product
could vary but would generally provide for coverage against lost revenues
due to hurricane warnings or general proximity of hurricanes near the
coastline.  We would be able to structure this offer with maximum
flexibility with regard to category of hurricane, level of coverage, exact
proximity, and pricing (swaps or options).

The other product line we are considering is a drought-related product that
keys off of low riverflow values on various river basins in Texas.   We
believe that the Guadalupe River in particular is susceptible to extremely
low riverflow values that could potentially result in production
disruptions to the downstream chemical industry that relies on the river to
meet cooling needs.  A review of 50 years of riverflow data (from the US
geological survey) suggests that if a drought of the magnitude of the one
in the 1950's were to reoccur, there is potential for multiple prolonged
production disruptions to many of the large chemical plants on this river,
including the Victoria Dupont plant.   The exact form of coverage offerred
would again depend on your specific needs.

Both of these products are in a stage that we need to determine whether or
not there is sufficient market interest to warrant further development.
Your feedback on whether or not these products might be of any interest to
you would be greatly appreciated.

On one other note, you mentioned that the agricultural business of Dupont
was considering some rainfall derivative contracts for hedging purposes.
We are very interested in discussing your needs versus our capabilities
with regard to this type of product.   Our marketing contact for this
subject is Valter Stoiani and he can be contacted by phone at 713-853-6906
or by E-mail at valter.stoiani@enron.com.


Thanks again,

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating 
that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged 
to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM 
method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

Subject: Results of Super Saturday

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone

Andrew,

Can we move tomorrow's meeting to 5:00 instead of 3:00?   I have a 
structuring class all day.  Mark will need to leave at ~5:30 so I'll try to 
be up here a little early if possible.  I'll send a nother note with a 
conference room if I can get one.

Subject: Stagecoach gas questions

Hi guys,

I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the 
answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the 
rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if 
you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this 
under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you 
guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso 
and ask questions they've already answered.


1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver 
this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?

2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If 
interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm 
storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    

3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP "cost of 
carry" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are 
there any "IN STORAGE"  transfer costs? 

4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?

5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach 
project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES 
inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?

6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a 
basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be 
firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  

7.  If possible, can EES "pick" an alternate delivery point as our primary 
point of delivery for this project? 


I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set 
aside - will this work for you Mark?

Thanks,

Andrew

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=

America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=

f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=

with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=

capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =

maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=

cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=

capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=

to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=

Charlie,

Could you please refresh the prices for the collars and the fixed prices as 
of friday's close?  We are trying to go out with the term sheet this week so 
we may need to reprice it once or twice.  Can you get this turned around 
Before this afternoon?  Please let me know.

Thanks for the help,

A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King 
Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings? 

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)
9) Commercial start date of plan
10) Any other issue to be discussed

Did I leave anything out?

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=

state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=

same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=

for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=

from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20

receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=

reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

Had a great time this weekend.  I'm sure glad that Travis got another good 
buck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the 
next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty 
possible next year.

I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her 
painting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she "owed" her but nothing more 
than that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that 
she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the 
money.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and 
Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this 
week as well.   If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach the 
subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.

Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she 
wasn't able to "prove" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  
She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not 
working outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our 
house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of 
things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If 
there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on 
these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good 
Christmas for everyone.

Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There 
is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can 
help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I'm sure you see 
my point of view here.


Thanks!

Charlie

Hi guys,

Please treat this as strictly confidential

Please take action ASAP

As you all know, the Enron Associate 2001 offers haven't been very popular 
among MBAs. Given the fact that December is decisions month and that, given 
the company growth, we cannot afford lose a new breed of highly qualified 
people, the following has been decided:

Present a proposal to Jeff Skilling today in order to improve the current 
offers. The proposal will be presented this afternoon, after two 
Associates-Skilling-HR interactions (in which Skilling expressed more than 
once his concern about Enron offers being so low compared to the market 
...I-Banks, Consulting firms).

Select one alumni per B-School represented in the 2000 Associate Class, you!

Authorize those representatives to send a standard e-mail (text provided 
below) to the candidates who got offers in their respective B-Schools, in 
order to gain some time until the official HR communication (hopefully caring 
good news) is submitted.

The standard e-mail should read EXACTLY as follows (we are not authorized to 
change or add anything):

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

To MBA students considering joining the Enron Associate Program,

I wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that a proposal to change 
the Associate compensation package has recently been presented to Jeff 
Skilling.  A decision concerning the recommended change is expected in the 
next few days.  More information will be provided as soon as possible.  Have 
a nice weekend!

Regards,

Representative Signature

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

We are asking you to the send the e-mail under your name because we want this 
notification to be informal. We have the authorization to do it this way.

In case you are contacted by any candidate, the offical position should be 
consistent with the one in the e-mail: a decision is expected very soon, we 
will let you know asap.

Please bcc me when you send the message, since it is important to keep track 
about which B-School candidates have been notified.

Thanks a lot for your help and quick response,

Roberto Conterno

Louis,

Attached you will find the historic prices for TETCO M3, HSC, and NYMEX FOM. 
I doubled check the HSC prices and XMIM gives you a historic price for HSC 
and a different one for Katy.

given our recent conversations....

"December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in
October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter
rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to
quieter than usual hurricane activity."

This is a section from an internal TWC memorandum - it looks like Q4 might 
make up for the quiet tropical season as far as their profits are concerned...

WEATHER CHANNEL EARNS HIGHEST RATINGS FOR ANY DECEMBER IN ITS HISTORY
Coverage of last month's "Winter Blitz"  brought The Weather Channel the
highest ratings for any December in its 18-year history and shattered
weather.com's previous December page view records. December 2000 was the
third highest-rated month ever. The Blizzard of '96 gave TWC its highest
ratings, followed by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999.
 Among the many recording-breaking weather events reported by TWC last month
were the snowiest weather ever in at least 12 cities and the coldest weather
on record in many places, including Louisville, Ky.
December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in
October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter
rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to
quieter than usual hurricane activity.
TWC's coverage of the year-end Nor'easter that blanketed New York City with
over a foot of snow achieved a 0.870 rating, delivering 679,000 households
across the country on Saturday, December 30 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.).  The top
quarter hour occurred at 10 a.m. with a rating of 2.279 reaching 1.8 million
households.  The weekend rating for Dec. 30-31 was 0.753,  representing over
a half million households tuned in at any given time, according to Nielsen
data.  This was the second highest-rated weekend in 2000 and the sixth
highest-rated weekend in TWC's history.
Consumers also turned to weather.com in record numbers. By the close of
December, weather.com delivered more than 429 million total page views,
which is 67 percent higher than the previous monthly record, and 232 percent
higher than December 1999.  At its peak, weather.com delivered a record 27.8
million page views in a single day.  More than 1.3 million Unique Visitors
frequented weather.com  per day during the two weeks prior to Christmas,
according to Media Metrix.
The average TWC rating (6 a.m.-6 a.m.) from Dec.16-31 was 0.598, delivering
an average of 464,000 households, according to Nielsen. This was 85 percent
higher than the average rating for the same two-week period the year before.
The Weather Channel's coverage of sustained winter activity, which included
a Chicago blizzard on Dec. 10-11, brought the network its highest-rated
December ever.  TWC achieved a December rating of 0.462 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.),
delivering an average of 360,000 households.

Hey Charlie:

We received 2 quotes from EES for 2 different scenarios:

If we run just winter months at the following load factor:  January (80%), 
February (80%), March ( 80%), April (70%), May (60%), September (60%), 
October (70%), November (80%), and December (80%), the power cost is 
$0.060/kwhrs.   

On the other hand, if we run year round (including a 60% load factor during 
the three summer months) the power cost is $0.064/kwhrs.  However, there is 
no call option value reflected in this scenario.  EES is currently 
determining the call option value for the summer months.

Please also review the attached spreadsheet for expected running hours.  We 
are asumming that the compressor will run during the night, 8pm to 8am, when 
El Paso will be packing the line with gas.  Peak usage will occur as the line 
becomes more packed, closer to the morning.  Curtailment (call option 
available hours) can take place during the peak hours of the day from 8am to 
8pm.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Maria

Thanks Charlie.  Except for Enron, Recruiting has gone very well.  I
guess you can't win them all.  I am waiting for one more offer before I
make a decision.  I will most likely end up in Houston back at El Paso.


If I end up back in Houston, we should grab lunch a couple of times.

Keep in touch.

Gary,

Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer 
Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.

Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent 
earnings warning.  Among other things, they mention that they had tough 
comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.  I believe they 
are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my 
opinion.

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001219/bs/rayovac_outlook_dc_1.html


One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The 
Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging 
against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are 
financially "not doing so well" at present due in some part to a lack of 
hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme 
cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and 
should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.

Please let me know how I may be of assistance.


Thanks,

Charlie

If you can leave the airport by 1:30, make it to dook by 2:00, leave dook
by 2:45 (3:00 at the absolute latest), then you'll probably be alright.
Cameron should take all of about 10 minutes to lose your excitement over,
then you can walk around and check out all the ugly pussy that plagues the
campus, then see a bunch of yankee butt pirates circle jerking in the quad,
buy yourself a championship t-shirt with jiz all over it (but they won it
with heart!), you can be out of there in 45 minutes easy!!  Without any
traffic delays, you'll be east of Raleigh where we can meet at 3:45 or 4:00
at the McDonalds at Hwy 42 and I-40 (write that down, it's about 10-15
minutes east of Raleigh).  If you get stuck west of Raleigh in a traffic
snarl, you could be there for 1-2 hours.  I work in Chapel Hill on
Wednesdays and won't drive back on I-40 if it's after 3:00, I take a back
route.

Let me give you directions to Orton just in case, it's easy.  I-40 from
Raleigh to Wilmington, as you approach Wilmington take a right at a big
light on Smith Creek Parkway (new since your day, it's just before Market
Street), go about 1-2 miles and it will end, take a right on 23rd St, pass
the airport on your right, road will come to an end again, take a left, I
think this is Hwy 133 South which takes you around/through nig-town
Wilmington, cross the Cape Fear River and follow signs to Southport staying
on Hwy 133 South which will go straight to Orton, follow the signs into the
gate and the house is on the right once you enter the gate.  From the
airport without major traffic it will take a good 2 1/2 hours without
stopping, say 3 hours with a pissing 4 year old!!

Gate House phone number 910-371-9240
My work number 919-552-6506
My cell phone 919-662-6711

Wesie and I will try to leave at 3:30 so we can meet at 4:00.  Call me when
you get to the airport and let me know what the deal is.  I'm in Chapel
Hill on Wednesday so you could reach me on my cell phone.  I won't get
e-mail on Wednesday.

Eric and Charlie,

I just wanted to let you know we met with Jean.  We determined an initial 
value and John is contacting Entergy today.

Thanks for all of your help.

Subject: CIBC Swap Volumes

Sanjeev;

Currently KCS Energy has a five year swap with CIBC that is currently 
out-of-the-money by approximately $25.0MM.  What we are considering is to 
require KCS to use part of the proceeds that we advance through a VPP to pay 
off this position.   However, based on the assumption of a declining price 
market, we would like to give them the ability to recoup a portion of the 
$25.0MM paid to CIBC through either Put Swaptions or Puts that are $0.30 to 
$0.60 out-of-the-money.

Attached is a spread sheet that has the volumes that KCS currently has swaps 
on with CIBC.  Could you please provide pricing for the following scenarios:


1) Put Swaptions:   at-the-money; $0.30 out-of-the-money; and $0.60 
out-of-the-money for the following terms begining in July 1, 2001.


a) 9/2001 through 8/2001
b) 9/2002 through 8/2002
c) 9/2003 through 8/2003
d) 9/2004 through 8/2004
e) 9/2005 through 8/2005


2) Puts; at-the-money; $0.30 out-of-the-money; and $0.60 out-of-the-money for 
the following terms beginning April 1, 2001

a) 4/2001 through 8/2005



If you have any questions, give a call.  Thanks.

Hi guys,

I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the 
answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the 
rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if 
you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this 
under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you 
guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso 
and ask questions they've already answered.


1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver 
this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?

2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If 
interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm 
storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    

3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP "cost of 
carry" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are 
there any "IN STORAGE"  transfer costs? 

4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?

5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach 
project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES 
inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?

6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a 
basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be 
firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  

7.  If possible, can EES "pick" an alternate delivery point as our primary 
point of delivery for this project? 


I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set 
aside - will this work for you Mark?

Thanks,

Andrew

Charles,

 Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has 
reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled "Fuel 
Oil Spec" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled "Comparison 
Specs" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel 
oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the 
following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
 chromium
 arsenic
 siloxenes
 copper corrosivity
 cetane index
 cetane number

Thank you,

Matt

Subject: Re: Fuel Specification Requirements  

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order 
for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no 
ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, 
I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs 
included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The 
second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to 
increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash 
to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for 
column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

Fuel Guys,

The information that y'all had requested in the meeting does not contain any 
output or heat balancing information that you will need to assist in the 
sizing of the lateral.  Jennifer and I provided Fred Mitro information that 
contained capital cost, property taxes and some other modeling assumptions.  
We did not give him any update or indication on where the output and heat 
rate numbers would be.

I have asked Jennifer to hold off sending you what was requested after 
today's meeting, because it is omitting the concrete information that you 
really need.  As soon as we receive new output and heat rate information, I 
will forward it directly.  If, for some reason, you need capital costs and 
property tax information, let me know.

Thanks,
Mathew

Eric -

We don't have any of the details yet, as we are still trying to get the 
physical contracts (and guaranties) in place with Neumin and Formosa.  Once 
all the paper is in place, Neumin/Formosa will flip their financial positions 
into physical positions.  It is my understanding that Neumin/Formosa have not 
yet made a decision on their unwind volumes.

I'll keep you updated once I get more info.

Jason/Tanya,

Could you please provide a brief update on the Neumin unwind.  We are in the 
process of updating our "deal sheet" regarding status and timing of next 
steps.

Thanks in advance,

Charlie, I don't know if you'll have any plans for the superbowl but if
you would like to come to Galveston you are more than welcome.  We will
be at Pop's house - Jimmy's brothers will be there - we are going to
plan the menu this evening but last night Mitchell and I decided some
nice heavy h'or'dourves (sp?) might be nice - and anything Mitchell
cooks is really worth the dive.  Anyway let me know.  Love, Margaret

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

Charlie,

Can you please update the gas price for the National Fuel deal in New York?  
Our customer called and would like updated deal economics from us.  This was 
the one that was NYMEX + INDEX (I think that BASIS was 0), and was on the USA 
side of the border.  I believe that we dinged the price approx. 5 to 6 cents 
for that.  In any case, I have attached the form with the relevant 
information.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need more 
information.

Thanks,

John

This is a section from an internal TWC memorandum - it looks like Q4 might 
make up for the quiet tropical season as far as their profits are concerned...

WEATHER CHANNEL EARNS HIGHEST RATINGS FOR ANY DECEMBER IN ITS HISTORY
Coverage of last month's "Winter Blitz"  brought The Weather Channel the
highest ratings for any December in its 18-year history and shattered
weather.com's previous December page view records. December 2000 was the
third highest-rated month ever. The Blizzard of '96 gave TWC its highest
ratings, followed by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999.
 Among the many recording-breaking weather events reported by TWC last month
were the snowiest weather ever in at least 12 cities and the coldest weather
on record in many places, including Louisville, Ky.
December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in
October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter
rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to
quieter than usual hurricane activity.
TWC's coverage of the year-end Nor'easter that blanketed New York City with
over a foot of snow achieved a 0.870 rating, delivering 679,000 households
across the country on Saturday, December 30 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.).  The top
quarter hour occurred at 10 a.m. with a rating of 2.279 reaching 1.8 million
households.  The weekend rating for Dec. 30-31 was 0.753,  representing over
a half million households tuned in at any given time, according to Nielsen
data.  This was the second highest-rated weekend in 2000 and the sixth
highest-rated weekend in TWC's history.
Consumers also turned to weather.com in record numbers. By the close of
December, weather.com delivered more than 429 million total page views,
which is 67 percent higher than the previous monthly record, and 232 percent
higher than December 1999.  At its peak, weather.com delivered a record 27.8
million page views in a single day.  More than 1.3 million Unique Visitors
frequented weather.com  per day during the two weeks prior to Christmas,
according to Media Metrix.
The average TWC rating (6 a.m.-6 a.m.) from Dec.16-31 was 0.598, delivering
an average of 464,000 households, according to Nielsen. This was 85 percent
higher than the average rating for the same two-week period the year before.
The Weather Channel's coverage of sustained winter activity, which included
a Chicago blizzard on Dec. 10-11, brought the network its highest-rated
December ever.  TWC achieved a December rating of 0.462 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.),
delivering an average of 360,000 households.

Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around 
again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that 
sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of 
$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. 
The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the 
rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering 
aftershocks
 throughout the U.S. energy community. 

As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California 
has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and 
the uncertain 
profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing 
sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. 

The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, 
Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are 
facing the
 prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity 
purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge 
their customers
 for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the 
gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. 

The risks to Enron are two-fold. 

For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the 
state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the 
company does
 operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a 
considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global 
revenue
 streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default 
payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the 
region. 

More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may 
pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis 
abates. Some also
 fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as 
regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended 
economic consequences. 

Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was 
deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination 
along the way. And a 
strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have 
pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. 

The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best 
course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E 
and Edison's
 ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the 
burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. 

Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks 
on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last 
week. The initial
 euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts 
will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic 
economic
 growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, 
we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized 
defensive plays
 like Enron. 

We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been 
overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was
 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in 
the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly 
in natural 
gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an 
environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. 

In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth 
help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the 
future. The 
markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and 
Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next 
year.
An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send 
profits measurably higher in the long term. 

Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, 
according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. 
Although the 
stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term 
volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the 
market 
approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going 
forward

This is an excerpt from an internal Weather Channel (Landmark Communications) 
newsletter.....


BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS
More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV
affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit,
and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow
the storms.
           In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found
out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent
who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into
a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -
with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the
storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13
percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.
           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at
weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,
delivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over
twice the average December monthly rating to date.
           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market
ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also
was within the top 10.

Charlie,

Large cap growth stock to consider is Concord EFS.   Ticker is CEFT.
Provides
electronic authorization services for purchases, settlement services,
clearing
house operations, and funds transfers.  Steady uptrend over the last three
years
with little sensitivity to  market swings.   Very highly recommended stock
with
10 strong buy recommendations.   EPS growth in 30-40% range, and PEG of
1.5.
Looks like a good stock to dampen volatility while still getting positives
of the
growing e-commerce volume/dollars/transaction numbers.




Paul

Darrell,

There still appears to be some confusion regarding the inclusion of FPUA's =
#6=20
ST into the deal.  The heat rate of the #6 ST should not be included in the=
=20
overall plant heat rate (neither gross nor net).  The heat rate of the=20
facility should include the GT and FPUA's #7 and #8 STs.  Duct firing #6=20
needs to be determined and calculated on a stand-alone basis.  Bottom line:=
 =20
whether FPUA or FPRP uses #6 to generate power, the heat rate associated wi=
th=20
#6 is the duct fired heat rate.  I have been anticipating results to look=

something like the following:

Combined Cycle HHV  7,800 heat rate (based on 183MW + 82MW =3D 265MW using=
=20
2,067MMBtu/hr)
FPUA 9,500 HHV  9,500 heat rate on 82MW =3D 779MMBtu/hr
FPRP Combined Cycle HHV 2,067MMBtu/hr - 779MMBtu/hr =3D 1,288MMBtu/hr for 1=
83MW=20
=3D 7,038 heat rate

Duct Firing HHV   10,000 heat rate on 14MW =3D 140MMBtu/hr (should equal th=
e=20
actual amount of additional gas needed to duct fire)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Mathew

Ed,

Here's the link to the gas fundamentals website that I mentioned.  It has a 
wealth of information on it, some of which the group can hopefully utilize.

Subject: Results of Super Saturday

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Hello, Charlie

I enjoyed talking with you re. your plans to use the DSSAT models in your
work doing crop forecasting related to commodities trading.  I have copied
in Gordon Tsuji, Univ. of Hawaii, who may also be able to help you by
referring you to people who have done similar activities.  Gordon has been
involved with the IBSNAT/DSSAT/ICASA work for a long time and was part of
the managing entity of the DSSAT project.

Subject: Gas Transport Issues for OPC

I wanted to quickly write up the conversations I have had today and yesterday 
with John Hodge (Gas Upstream Origination - I think this is the name of the 
group) related to gas transport issues for Georgia.  As I said yesterday, 
Transco Zone 4 is at the Mississippi/Alabama border, and is not a delivered 
price to Georgia.  The only Inside FERC SONAT index is in Louisiana.  Each of 
these points are supply basins, and not delivered Indices.  Hence the need to 
pay transport costs to the delivery area.  Below I have detailed the issues 
on each of these pipes.

Transco Zone 4

Currently, Enron is working on a project with Transco to expand the pipeline 
in Zone 4 (Project Momentum).  This project is related to development sites 
at Athens and Hartwell.  John said he thought that Athens and Hartwell were 
each a 500 MW combined cycle facility.  The negotiated rate for capacity on 
this expansion is ABOVE max rate for Transco Zone 4.  The current max rate 
for intra-zone transport is $0.21 for demand and variable costs 
(approximately $0.03 is variable).  The negotiated rates for this expansion 
is $0.24 for Athens and $0.27 for Hartwell.  Rememeber that the demand prices 
must be paid year round for the maximum capacity needed, regardless of the 
actual usage.  These prices do not include the cost of fuel.  If we were to 
purchase transport from Onshore Louisiana to each of these delivery points, 
you can expect to add another $0.05 to the above prices.  Transco has 
informed us that if we do not continue with this project, there are plenty of 
people waiting to buy capacity on this expansion, and that they are already 
planning another expansion after this.  

Sonat Zone 3

Skygen (Calpine) is working with SONAT to expand their capacity (approx. 
120,000/mmbtu/day) for a development in Augusta.  SONAT has said that they 
should be able to expand this at current max rate prices.  The current max 
rate is $0.55, which is $0.16 variable, and $0.39 demand.  This expansion is 
from an offshore pipe through Destin pipeline to connect with SONAT.  
Recently, SONAT has sold their capacity at prices lower than max rate in 
order compete with Transco.  

Elba Island

Theoretically, SONAT should offer Intrazonal transport from Elba Island at a 
discount to max rate.  However, I think SONAT (El Paso) is still trying to 
figure out what to do since we now have access to this facility. Currently, 
SONAT does not want discount the transport cost.  We are waiting to see what 
price SONAT charges El Paso to transport their gas from Elba Island.  So far, 
they haven't reached an agreement (that we know of), but we are hoping that 
SONAT will offer this at a discount to El Paso, and then we will 'force' them 
to give us the same rate.  John thinks that they will charge max rate for the 
transport, but embed some sort of discount into the gas price to try to get 
around offering Enron a discounted rate.

I hope this helps!

Edith

Les,

Note redlined document (1st attachment) from Alan.  

Alan received the GA and Alabama power RFP's.  I will get copies shortly.  
Due date is July 2, 2001 which is 12 weeks away.  Alan wants our deal done 6 
weeks prior to the due date so we have an extra 6 weeks to negotiate.  
Southern Co has 1800 MW in the que and is 1st in line to win the bid provided 
economics are good.

I know you are in London but give me a call if you have the time so we can 
discuss.

Thanks.

Dan,

Attached is a redlined letter agreement with Southern Co. that I have made 
changes based on our discussion with them late Friday.  Les is going to help 
with some of the language.  Make sure to incorporate the new language on 
"Binding Commitment to Enter Into Confirmation Letter" I sent to you last 
Thursday or Friday.  I will send it again just to be sure.  As soon as he is 
ready, lets sitdown and discuss the agreement.  We have been able to raise 
Southern Co.'s price from Hub + $.15 to Hub + $.20 or $.21 with the 
possibility of up to Hub + $.25.  We will know more on price on Tuesday but 
lets keep blank for the time being.  I will be back in town on Tuesday.  Talk 
to you soon.

Thanks.

Loftus,

Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns 
for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to 
analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you 
might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or 
year or whatever.  I c an help you do this if you want.    Remember that this 
is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering 
that the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate 
what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get 
you the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.

Thanks,

Charlie

I got this message for a contractor that might be interested in working with 
us on the lateral.  Steve Thome had good luck with them on a water line and 
wanted to pass the name along.  He also called and mentioned a guy who is 
with an Enron affiliate - Northern Border - and is interested in a pipeline 
spur as well.  His phone number is 303-575-6479.  May be helpful to keep it 
in the Enron family.

Rusty,

Here is the contact for our pipeline contractor:

Clark Ashton
Rooney Engineering
1418 Millstream Lane
Salt Lake City, UT 84106

801-463-7981 

Clark is the business development guy.  He is well connected in the power 
industry (he used to work for NEPCo).  I believe Rooney specializes in 
pipeline installation - they certainly are extremely knowledgeable.  I 
suggest you contact Clark to find out more.

Subject: Neumin Production - REVISED POSITIONS

Neumin Team -

As you know, I have been trying to sort out a problem that we have regarding 
trade N52632 with Neumin Production.  The issue surrounded the expiration 
dates of the various legs of this trade, with confusion about whether those 
legs were to expire in December '01 or December '02.

At the present, it is the general consensus of the Confirms/Origination teams 
that the legs in question (legs 2 & 4) should expire at the end of December 
'01.  I say "general consensus" because we have no clear, concrete evidence 
that this expiration is correct.  Our own internal systems show a lot of 
conflicting indications, so the long and the short of this "investigation" is 
that we are relying on the memories of our originators to verify the terms of 
the deal.

So, attached is the Neumin position spreadsheet, with updated terms for legs 
2 and 4.  I have also added a sheet that shows Neumin's production profile, 
based on the reserve report of 1/1/01.  Included on this sheet is a "Net 
Overhedge" calculation which shows the amount of hedged production above 
projected production (as of 1/1/01).


Please let me know if you have any questions.


Jay

Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. 
King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).  We have answers to all questions 
except the quality specifications of the fuel oil.  We expect an answer on 
the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether 
the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our 
quality specs).  We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the 
engineers.

How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon 
order?

Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and 
to review any additional questions.  Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at 
x57229 with any questions.

Thanks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------


1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   

 The delivering trucks will require pumps.

2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     

 The line is 3"


3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings?    

 Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings.


4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    

The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from 
Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl 
the MHI requirements are known.

5) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?  

 Someone is always on duty at plant so deliveries can technically be made on 
a 24/7 basis.  The plant manager did say he would like to avoid a long line 
of trucks out the plant in order to maintain good relationships with the 
neighbors.


6) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  

 At this point we are only replacing the 200,000 gallons of oil we had Fort 
Pierce burn in order to empty their old tank and allow us to clear that 
location for our plant.  Additional oil may be purchased later (next year) 
after development plans are further along.


7) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   

 The plant requires non-Dyed fuel.


8) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   

 Coastal was the previous supplier to the plant.


9) Design a fuel resupply plan including pre-purchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods

  Such a plan appears to be premature at this point but we will review the 
issues with you at a later date.

10) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   

  Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record.

11) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  

  We are looking for a firm fixed price bid for filling the tank, unless you 
would recommend otherwise.

12) Commercial start date of plan     

  The tank will be finished and available for fill on 5/15/2001.

13) Any other issue to be discussed

  None that we are aware of.

to predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forward=

weather scenarios.  We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is high=

regarded in the agricultural modeling community.  One of the primary author=

217 Camino Principal, Belton, Texas 76513 and telephone is 254-933-7742.
His colleague, Dr. Gerritt Hoogenboom, at the University of Georgia has=20
confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that Dr. Ritchie=

would be ideal for providing us the help that we need.

A second software product known as =01&Pcyield=018 has been suggested.  Pcy=

Dr. Hoogenboom has suggested that the DSSAT model that we purchased is=20

that he wants to visit us in Houston on February 2nd.

In the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)

  Worker Dead at Desk For 5 Days

     Bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed
  that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE
DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.

     George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New
  York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he
  shared with 23 other workers. He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody
  noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.

      His boss Elliot Wachiaski said "George was always the first guy in
each morning and the last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that
  he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything. He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself."

      A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days
  after suffering a coronary. Ironically, George was proofreading
  manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

Sure.  I thought you said Friday.  That's actually better for us, because I
had to turn down an invitation from my sister in brother-in-law on Friday
night.  Do you want to have lunch on Friday?

Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

Charlie - 

I am in an off site vendor meeting this morning and hope to be in the office 
later this afternoon.  Unfortunately, I am out of town on Friday (I am 
actually headed to Austin for a visit).  But could perhaps do something 
Monday morning, if I can't get to the office in time this afternoon.  Let me 
know your availability.  Thanks so much.

Eric,

I am preparing my presentation for Jean and John and I have one quick 
question.  You indicated the average gas price was $4.94.  Yesterday you also 
mentioned how that valuation would have changed if it would have been 
calculated last April.  Do you know what the average price would have been if 
calculated last April?  I think this would help put things in perspective.

Thanks
Sarah

Subject: Hurricane Warning Derivatives

Folks,

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments


It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.


Thanks,

Charlie

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20

Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =

significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=

financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=

maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=

industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=

marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=

Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=

involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=

report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=

and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=

securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20

OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=

As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=

companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =
=20
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20
conduct business in that company.=20

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20

Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the
business side of things.  In return, I'll answer any questions you have
on politics.  I've now been involved with Republican politics for almost
exactly seven years, so I have a little bit of experience with politics
and leadership. :)

Here you go guys - we can get as detailed as we want in these term sheets, 
but this will give you an idea of how we start out.  See you on Thursday.

Eric and Charlie -

Attached is the same Neumin spreadsheet that I sent you last week, showing 
deals/volumes/prices per month.  I have added a new sheet titled 'Unwind' 
that shows the volumes and prices for the unwind trade(s) that I want to 
propose to Formosa.  You will see that I have held the unwind volumes 
constant within each calendar year (e.g., the unwind volumes for Cal '01 are 
8,000 MMBTU/day, the unwind volumes for Cal '02 are 19,000 MMBTU/day, etc.) 
but the PRICES change each month, to correspond with the pricing of their 
current "hedge" positions.

Can you please prepare a proposal for Formosa based on the attached unwind 
structure?  As you know, this unwind proposal would include an annuity 
stream, payed out from the present through December 2006, that accounts for 
the payment required to execute the unwind.  I think we should prepare a 
quote whereby Formosa pays an equal monthly amount from the present through 
December 2006 to amortize the unwind payment.

I would like to get a proposal to Formosa ASAP; I told them that I would get 
them a proposal on Monday.  Maybe that was a little aggressive, huh?  Please 
let me know what you can do.


Thanks,

Jay

Per Andrew, Let's plan on meeting (or at least touching base) on Thursday at 
3:00.  I'm attaching a revised summary and a spreadsheet derived from the one 
Maria sent me on Monday.  Please take time to review both documents to see if 
we're still heading down the right path....

Tyrell,

Give me a call and we can discuss what info to give out.  Note that the 
payout %s on Misaka ENA Canada and Crestone were just back solves to get them 
the flat amounts.

I'm going to forward on the Petro-Canada sheet to Dean Drodziak in Calgary.

Thanks for your time in meeting with us.  Attached is the information on 
Unocal.  The minimum required deliverable volumes are based on 40% load 
factor, and the put is based on 10% above that (volumes between a 40% and a

Thanks and please call me if you have any questions.

Can there not be an argument made to dive into TXN?  It's trading at 25 
forward P/E (2001) with a 5-year consensus growth rate of 24.2.  A PEG of ~1 
on a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great 
market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, 
right?  What's your view?

The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this 
is a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got 
the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin 
pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high 
growth in technology?  I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of 
the megacap stocks with great market positions, like TXN, are sure tempting.

Nasdaq down 46% from its March high and not looking good at the open.  This 
could be a "buy while there is blood in the streets" opportunity.

Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its=

ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20
often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=
=20
traders. "That's=20
how you find out what's going on," he says.

Skilling doesn't think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=
t=20
like an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=
=20

 presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=

to capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=
=20
and electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20
industries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20
insatiable demand,=20
has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=
=20
their customers. That suits Enron just fine.

New Economy Initiatives
The company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=
=20
its regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation's largest buyer
 and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=
=20
trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=
s=20
really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron's new-economy=
=20
initiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=
ng=20
system, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=
=20
more than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20
Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=
=20
delivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading
 bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20
million in revenue for the first nine months of this year.

Although energy remains Enron's main source of revenue and earnings,=20
management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=
ap
 into new markets. "In five years, we will be a substantially different=20
company," says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. "Underlying=20
everything we=20
do is the ability to make markets more efficient." Along with bandwidth,=20
Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=
s=20
trading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=
=20
and data storage. "Trading is the ultimate scalable concept," adds Skilling=
.=20
"We're
 using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20
potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited."

Investors have bought into Enron's vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=
h=20
at a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=
e=20
big
 question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20
Enron's stock price and what happens if the company's broadband strategy=20
doesn't=20
unfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.

"We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20
suited for the changing economy."
=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron

Company Culture
Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20
management down, employees have little doubt that they're creating=20
revolutionary
 new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20
Enron's headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20
ticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron's stock price.

Management
Ken Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=
=20
the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=
=20
where he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=
=20
forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being
deregulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=
es=20
could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=
s.=20
But=20
with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=
=20
and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The
 new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =
a=20
trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=
=20
process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=

in the 1990s.

Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=
h.=20
"Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known," sa=
ys=20
Lay,=20
who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20
consultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. "I've made it clea=
r=20
for
 some time that he's my successor." The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=
y=20
joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when
 describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu=
l=20
but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future.

Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20
bottom. "We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=
d=20
developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas," Lay says. Take Michae=
l=20
Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=
=20
came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=
t=20
begins its operations later this year, he will run it.

Wholesale Energy
Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=
=20
still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=
=20
year,=20
nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20
energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20
risk-management=20
products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=
om=20
its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=
=20
bought=20
from other energy producers with excess capacity.

The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20
EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=
=20
Margins
 are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =
of=20
electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just=
=20
to=20
make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =
it=20
to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20
contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=
=20
principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=
=20
the product,=20
be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20
wholesale energy business average one to three percent.

Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=
r=20
than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=
ce=20
moves. "Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20
modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20
throughout=20
the country," says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=
s=20
who closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20

at=20

supply and demand.

Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=
=20
deregulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20
Scandinavia=20
in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20
making markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20
still loom large and=20
national differences present formidable hurdles. "We're the only company wi=
th=20
pan-European operations," says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy
 unit. "There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20
difficult."

Broadband Operations
The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20
bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=
y
 market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=
s=20
gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20
being deployed,=20
"the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in," says Kenneth=
=20
Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. "Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=
g=20
traded like=20
a commodity."

Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=
=20
carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest
 (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=
=20
sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=
=20
carriers,
 and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=
=20
for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20
15,000 miles
 and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.

Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=
=20
which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=
s=20
into=20
paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20
demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=
s=20
of=20
time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=
f its=20
CEO to its offices around the globe.

The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20
monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=
n=20
a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=
 a=20
speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron
 delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20
quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20
months. Both
 Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20
annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=
gy=20
contributed=20
in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=
=20
broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=
=20
$2=20
billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).

The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering=
=20
streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches
 made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=
=20
along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system
 is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=
ge=20
from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=
E:=20
BBI),=20
which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=
=20
Enron's network. "Video will be the king application," Skilling says. "That=
's=20
where=20
it's all going to happen."

Other Growth Drivers
Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million=
=20
for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20
retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20
30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=
=20
stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=
=20
million in the process.

Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=
=20
businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=
r=20
operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=
=20
from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20
energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20
gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group
 (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=
=20
billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate=
=20
properties. "The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're=
=20
going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail," says Marty Sunde,
head of the group's North American unit.

Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=
t=20
sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20
in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=
=20
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=
=20
target to=20
land $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year's total.=
=20
"There's no reason this business can't roughly double in each of the next f=
ew=20
years,"=20
Lay says.

"Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=
=20
but their track record warrants that."
=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham

The Competition
Some of Enron's trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=
he=20
deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.
 Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=
nd=20
called "Enron Jr." by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20
electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=
=20
same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is
 much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including=
=20
Aquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20
energy-trading=20
system to rival EnronOnline.

Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=
e=20
(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards
 for companies to find trading partners. They don't actually deliver the=20
product, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20
business,=20
Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=
l=20
utilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron's geographic scope.

"It's a challenge to value Enron's stock, because it's such a hybrid. It=20
always seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations."
=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.

What It's Worth
Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=
=20
its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20
also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=
t=20
to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business=
es
 are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=
=20
$80, Enron's pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=
=20
valued at $5,
wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=
=20
$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=
=20
energy=20
is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20
year, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron's projected total EBIT. And=
=20
wholesale=20
energy's EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=
he=20
next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20
markets.=20
Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=
=20
broadband,=20
not to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=
ng=20
argues, Enron's stock is easily worth $130.

Analysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20
higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=
s=20
still=20
a couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=
=20
Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20
potential=20
of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=
=20
market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=
=20
mid-1990s.
 Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than=
=20
Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=
=20
for bandwidth
 would make Enron a $100 stock.

Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20
Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=
r=20
=01* and
 maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=
 $92.

Social Responsibility
Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce=
=20
methane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But=
=20
certain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant =
in=20
India, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20
protests=20
against the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20
Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th=
e=20
suppression of dissent and didn't speak out against human rights violations=
.=20
Enron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000
 to improve the community's water and sanitation infrastructures.

The Upside
With less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20
competition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie=
ve=20
the entire=20
market will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20
expand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could=
=20
get a=20
boost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:=
=20
AOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via
 the Internet. Enron's attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi=
a=20
ended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn't one of=
=20
its strengths.=20
So it's relying on IBM's back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and=
=20
AOL's Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power.

The Downside
The much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.=
=20
Currently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and
 Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called=
=20
last-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving=
=20
very=20
slowly. She doesn't expect wide-scale availability of video-on-demand befor=
e=20
2004.

Who Needs It?
Enron's mix of the old and new economies should appeal to all but the most=
=20
conservative investors. Its energy trading and pipeline businesses give it =
a=20
stable source of cash flow, while its new Internet-based ventures give it t=
he=20
great growth potential of a tech stock.

Just a small correction.  The demand number of $.85 is actually $.8215, 
commodity is $.0307 and fuel is 3%.  The unofficial in service date is 5/03.

A good time, indeed!  Looking forward to another group trip sometime in the 
near future.

I do not have the resources (time or money) to become heavily involved but I 
would be interested in possibly helping out on Congressional elections for 
2002 as well as any other opportunities that may arise in town to "hob-knob" 
or otherwise contribute.

I'll consider what the most efficient way is for you to further your 
knowledge of business, etc.

We should be getting the pictures developed in the next day or two.  I'm 
looking forward to the digital ones you've got so I can forward them around.  
I added my sisters to the GOPUSA distribution list and may add some others 
later tonight.

When is the website going to have our pictures?


Thanks,

Charlie

Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the
business side of things.  In return, I'll answer any questions you have
on politics.  I've now been involved with Republican politics for almost
exactly seven years, so I have a little bit of experience with politics
and leadership. :)

When will Melissa have your pictures developed?

Bobby

Over the past 90 days, fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork 
with regulators for the first four mutual funds focusing on the 
new-power/alternative energy industries. Unlike broader energy funds, this 
pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities 
sector, namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities 
unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways 
to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car.

Vince, 

Mr. Horn's request has been taken care of.  He has the data he wanted and 
knows how to call it up on his Bloomberg terminal in the future.

Subject: Neumin Production Unwind

Clara,

Charlie and I spoke with Pushkar this morning regarding a potential partial 
unwind of several deals with between Enron and Neumin Production (Formosa 
sub).

Neumin currently has the following 8 swaps and 1 option,



Enron's credit group (Jay Williams) is proposing a partial unwind, which 
would be achieved by 
Booking a new ticket that is approximately $66 million out of the money to 
Enron (PV using LIBOR flat), and 
Booking an annuity (note receivable from Neumin) for this $66 million at 
8.5%, which results in ~$85 million nominal over the term.

So, Pushkar asked us to send you the change in nominal cash flow from this 
partial unwind.  Attached is a file, which shows the nominal cash flow 
increase.

Please let Charlie and I know if you need additional information or have any 
questions.  Let is know if we need to lock in the LIBOR at your bid (I think 
that is right?)

Regards,

Eric

Andrew,  Attached is a draft of the Master Firm/Purchase between EES and ECS 
and its accompany Transaction Agreement.  I think it does make sense to have 
a separate agreement to encompass the overall annual true between the power 
and gas sides.  Need to discuss this with EES' attorney.  I will contact Bo 
and see who is the lead attorney on this deal.   Please review the attached 
documents and let me know before you send this to EES.  As you will see I 
have a few question noted on the TA.

Subject: Oil Status UPdate -- response to your questions

   

I spoke with Doug Leach regarding your questions.  He has already contacted 
4-5 suppliers/truckers and is ready to rock and roll when we know what spec. 
of No. 2 we need.  As such, they are all set to supply our requirement.  Doug 
reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want 
to build with a supplier.  He is particularly concerned if the plant switches 
to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a 
logistical nightmare.  


He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by 
buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).  However, 
his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) 
as a result of gasoline prices cooling off.

He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.  We should get results in the 
next several days.

4/1/00 - 9/30/00.  The new fuel percentage will be 2.90% instead of 2.25%.  
The effective fuel unit commodity surcharge for FTS-1 and FTS-2 will also 
change (a decrease).  The new commodity rate for FTS-1 will be $0.0348/Dth 
instead of $0.0475.  The new commodity rate for FTS-2 will be $0.0178/Dth 
instead of $0.0305/Dth.  If you have any questions, please call.

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the 
Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave 
Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie 
Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final 
engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall 
runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is 
expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are 
dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This 
equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in 
only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly 
capacity requirements:


   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	
Capacity From East Desk
May	22,300	0	22,300	0
June	22,300	0	22,300	0
July	22,300	0	22,300	0
August	22,300	0	22,300	0
September	22,300	0	22,300	0

  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity 
from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas 
requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is 
dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to 
run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus 
leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This 
equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 
16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused 
capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month 
as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities 
available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will 
come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




 
   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 
(Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412

Your welcome and thank you - we were glad you could make it.  After you'll
left Elizabeth said "Mama, I thought you said Melissa had a baby in her
stomach."  She also wanted to know when they were going to cut it out.
Anyway, the Mardi Gras parades I wanted you'll to go to are on February 17th
at noon and at 6:00.  If you go to www.mardigrasgalveston.com you can see all
of the events.  We would really like it if you'll came - the kids always
enjoy jumping for the beads - the adults do too.  Let Stacey and Russell know
that they are welcome too.  Love, Margaret

here you go guys.  This is the basic term sheet - it doesn't stipulate much 
about the gas - the contract will do that..

I figured you were exhausted so I didn't call - I hope Melissa and Hunter are
better.  I have updated your address and they made me update my pin number - 
it
is 68966896 - they now have to be 6-8 digits.  I got my new subscription today
- it is really neat - thank you.  Also, for tax purposes am I right in 
thinking
that I will only have to claim $2,000 as earned income since that is all we
moved - the year before it was much more and I had to pay taxes.  Let me know.
Love, Margaret

Subject: Release Orig to Canada

Further to our conversation, pls release $ 1,004,000 US funds to the Canadian 
Orig Desk Head, Eric Ledain. 

These funds will come out of the prudency account that has been set up to 
distribute these payment obligations.

Gerald, I would like to raise a confirm between ENA and ECC that stipulates 
why we are paying them these amounts. 

Total payment was in consideration of ECC syndication of PCHC and Misako of 
which the granted amount on Misako was $ 200,000 .


If there are any questions, give me a call. 

BT
