Peter & Michelle,
?
Brian Hiebert forwarded to me Peter's questions regarding the risk of  
asbestos litigation at Celgar. 
?
Under the Workers Compensation Act, employers in British  Columbia are 
required to contribute to an accident fund which provides  compensation for 
injuries or occupational diseases arising out of employment. In  turn,?the 
Act?provides employers statutory immunity from?damages  in respect of any 
personal injury, disablement or death arising out of and in  the course of 
employment.
?
The accident fund would cover asbestos claims. There are no  exceptions?which 
would allow asbestos litigation?against employers.  The Act does?not 
prohibit?litigation against third parties, eg.  manufacturers of asbestos, 
but employers, as stated, are immune from such  actions.
?
Compensation is payable if the worker sustains pulmonary injury by a  
disabling form of asbestosis. We will make the appropriate enquires about 
any  compensation paid to Celgar employees.
?

We have completed the benefits portion of the due diligence report on Project 
Canary.  The highlighted portions require additional information and 
documentation.  As per our discussion yesterday, there are numerous questions 
regarding Compensation in the Benefits section.  It is my understanding that 
Compensation is responding to those issues.  If you have any questions or if 
we can be of assistance, please let us know.

Michelle,

I would appreciate an update on your thought on the Volker Eyermann Contract 
that I gave you during our meeting a couple of weeks ago.  We need to get 
something before Volker soon, so that he can have an opportunity to review 
and comment before we start on 15 January 2001 in Kansas City.

Regards
James

Michelle, I reviewed the Project Canary Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and
offer the following observations:

In an asset transaction, where the buyer did not want to acquire or assume
the employee benefit plans of the seller, I have always recommended to
include such plans and liabilities in the statement of excluded assets.
Based on the recitals for this transaction, and other provisions of the
Agreement (Sections 7 and 10) it appears that the employee benefit plans are
not excluded.

Generally, when such employee benefit plans are included in an asset
transaction, the buyer wants to obtain representations as to the funding,
compliance and administration of the plans.  These kinds of representations
are not in the Agreement.

The bottom line is that the buyer needs to rely on Canadian counsel and
actuaries to gives buyer the level of comfort it desires to have with respect
to these issues of funding, compliance and administration so that they can be
inserted into the financial model for determining the offering price.

You may wish to obtain a formal opinion letter from the Canadian counsel and
actuary regarding the level of comfort the buyer requires.


Pat

SUPREME COURT HEARS ARGUMENT ON FORUM FOR INJURED DECKHAND'S
CLAIMS

The U.S. Supreme Court hears oral argument in a case
involving an injured deckhand who wants to pursue a state
court personal injury suit under the Jones Act and a
shipowner who wants instead to proceed with a Limitation of
Liability Act suit in federal court ("Lewis v. Lewis & Clark
Marine Inc., "U.S., No. 99-1331, 11/29/00). James Lewis
claims he injured his back while working aboard a tugboat
owned by Lewis & Clark Marine Inc. on the Mississippi River.
The company sued in federal court in Missouri under the
Limitation Act, which allows shipowners to limit their
liability to the value of the shipowner's interest in the
vessel and its freight if the damage or injury occurred
without the shipowner's knowledge. Lewis then sued in an
Illinois state court, bringing Jones Act and other claims.

Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Limitation
Act suits, which do not allow jury trials, but the "savings
to suitors clause" allows claimants to keep access to "all
other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled" under
other statutes or common law. The Eighth Circuit blocked
Lewis's state court suit, finding the federal court had
exclusive jurisdiction. His attorney argues to the Supreme
Court that the state suit should proceed and only if the
judgment exceeds the value of the vessel and its freight
should the company be able to go to federal court to limit
the judgment. . . . Page AA-1

DOL'S REGULATORY PLAN SUGGESTS FAST RULEMAKING PACE THROUGH
JANUARY

The Labor Department anticipates taking final action on
eight regulations in the next two months that it has
designated as priority items, including updates to its child
labor regulations, simplification of occupational illness
and injury recordkeeping requirements, and efforts to
improve protections for coal miners, according to the
agency's latest regulatory plan. Also on the priority list
is finalization of regulations governing the welfare-to-work
grants program and revisions to the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration's steel erection safety requirements.

According to an accompanying semiannual regulatory agenda,
imminent action also is expected on final rules changing the
regulations governing benefit payments under the Black Lung
Benefits Act; establishing new rules for employers dependent
on highly skilled temporary workers under the H-1B program;
streamlining the labor certification process governing the
permanent employment of aliens; banning discrimination
against health care plan participants and beneficiaries
based on health status; and exempting certain government
contracts for commercial services from the Service Contract
Act. OSHA is planning next month to publish two final rules,
one intended to provide for full employee involvement in the
agency's consultation program and the other revising the
existing standard addressing emergency exit routes in
workplaces. . . . Page C-1,  Text E-1,  E-23

'TENDER BACK' AGE BIAS REGULATIONS COMING SOON FROM EEOC

EEOC is on the verge of issuing a final regulation providing
guidance on making payments to employees who waive their
rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
according to the agency's semiannual regulatory agenda
scheduled for publication in the Nov. 30 "Federal Register."

A second regulation, clarifying the application of Section
501 of the Rehabilitation Act as it applies to federal
sector employees, also is scheduled for final publication
soon. However, one of the major regulatory issues facing the
commission, the legality of conversions to "cash balance"
pension plans under the age discrimination act, is not
formally addressed in the agenda. . . . Page C-2,  Text E-84

EIGHTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS BOARD ORDER COUNTING TEMPORARY
WORKER'S BALLOT

The Eighth Circuit upholds the National Labor Relations
Board's decision to count the outcome-determinative ballot
of a temporary employee in a representation election among
on-air personnel of a Kansas City, Mo., television station
owned by New World Communications ("New World Communications
v. NLRB, "8th Cir., No. 99-3228, 11/27/00).

Judge Wollman says the board's decision to count Amanda
Jahn's vote in favor of representation by the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists was supported by
both the "date certain" and the "reasonable expectation"
tests for determining whether a temporary employee is
entitled to vote in a representation election. Jahn's vote
breaks a tie, resulting in a 16-15 outcome in favor of AFTRA
representation. . . . Page A-1

FIRED SOFTWARE FIRM DIRECTOR FAILS TO ESTABLISH BREACHED
CONTRACT

A Texas software company director fired after only a few
months on the job fails to persuade the Fifth Circuit that
the software company breached an employment contract or
fraudulently induced him to leave his old job ("Hamilton v.
Segue Software Inc.,  "5th Cir.,  No. 00-10541,  11/20/00).

The Fifth Circuit affirms summary judgment for Segue
Software Inc. on the claims brought by Randall K. Hamilton,
finding that an employment contract between the parties did
not expressly limit the employer's right under Texas law to
fire Hamilton at will. The court rejects Hamilton's argument
that an offer of an annual salary indicates a one-year
employment contract. In addition, there was no evidence that
Segue or its chief executive officer made any
misrepresentations or fraudulently concealed the company's
financial status in convincing Hamilton to take the job, the
court says. . . . Page A-7

WAGES UP 3.8 PERCENT IN CONTRACTS BARGAINED IN 2000

Data compiled by BNA in the first 48 weeks of 2000 show a
weighted average first-year wage increase in newly
negotiated contracts of 3.8 percent. In the same period last
year, the increase was 3.3 percent. Manufacturing
settlements provided a weighted average increase of 3.2
percent, and the weighted average increase in
nonmanufacturing agreements, excluding construction
contracts, was 4 percent.

Among new settlements included in the latest biweekly wage
tabulation are contracts between: ABCO Markets, Fry's, and
Safeway Inc. and the United Food and Commercial Workers;
Dominick's and Jewel Food Stores and the United Food and
Commercial Workers. . . . Page D-12

Ann:  I do not know anything about this---I very quickly glanced at the 
materials, and what is suggested presents some pretty major  issues (Michelle 
is right---there are tax issues, corporate veil issues, and possibly other 
technical employee benefit regulatory issues).  This is clearly outside of my 
area of expertise; I think this is probably more in Sharon's, Kriste's and 
Pat's area.  Why don't we discuss this at our staff meeting on Wednesday.  If 
we need to get together sooner, please let me know.   Thanks, Rex.

Do you have any thoughts/comments on the proposal discussed in the attached 
email?  Basically, the proposal is to create three holding companies that 
will house all employees of Enron and its subsidiaries/affiliates, and then 
"lease" the employees to the various business units in which they work.  
Potential issues I see include tax and corporate veil issues.

Your thoughts would be appreciated.

In late September, I sent a note on excess OASDI payment by Enron and excess 
OASDI withholdings from employees when U. S. domestic employee transfers 
occur between Enron BUs but never received a response -  note David O'Dell's 
e-mail below.  Understand Enron has looked at this area before, but feel we 
should look again to see if there are any viable alternatives to the current 
situation.

Could you please look at the attachment in my original e-mail (below) and let 
us know where we stand.how to proceed?

Thanks,

Bob,

Janice and I met with E&Y Tax Services today to discuss a number of topics 
including potential organizational structural modification strategies. One 
strategy discussed was very similar to the proposal you made back in 
September. We are planning to have the E&Y folks come back in to discuss 
these ideas in more detail. 

A couple of questions for you come to mind:
Did you ever get a response from Legal and/or Tax on your proposal?
Would you like to attend the next meeting with E&Y?

Please let me know your thoughts...

Subject: Excess OASDI Payments and Withholding Issue

Sharon / Michelle / Kriste:

The enclosed document addresses excess OASDI payment by Enron and excess 
OASDI withholdings from employees when U. S. domestic employee transfers 
occur between Enron BUs.


The current situation results in significant  Enron excess OASDI payment 
annually, and creates issues with employee due to overwithholding resulting 
in employee complaints and ill will towards HR, Payroll, and Enron.  The 
document depicts apparent options, and a potential solution, to the current 
situation.  This is viewed as an HR customer service issue to ensure Enron 
employees receive the best overall service possible in their interface to the 
HR function and systems.

 It is my understanding that Enron Executive Management feel that employee 
transferability among the BUs is important, and wishes to see more movement 
of employees (as well as thoughts and ideas) between the BUs in the future to 
enhance employee opportunities and Enron's value.  This being the case, I 
would expect the Enron cost and employee impacts and issues to be acerbated 
as additional and increased employee movement occurs in the future.  

We need Legal review of the issues and opportunities as presented in the 
document to determine a solution to the current - and pending future - 
situation, and look forward to any guidance you can provide in resolving the 
problems the current situation creates for Enron employees who transfer 
between Enron entities within a tax year and to mitigate potential future 
issues.  

If there is not a Legal obstacle, we will then go to Tax to address the 
specific tax entity issues.

Regards,

Bob

The contact person at Cogentrix  whom we typically engage is Tom Bonner.  You 
might keep this name in mind if you cannot reach Tom McCarrin. The phone

Subject: ALAMAC--Employee Due Diligence

Dee,

Ozzie Pagan called me earlier today and informed me that Cogentrix's Tom 
McCarrin (sp?) had started to compile basic employee/employment information 
relative to the two North Carolina power plants that ENA is planning to 
acquire from Alamac Knit Fabrics.  I then spoke to Michelle Cash and she 
agreed with me that it would be best if you would call Mr. McCarrin in order 
to give him guidance as to the specific employee and benefits information 
that you are going to want to see.  I am told that he has not been given the 
Due Diligence Worksheet.

Mr. McCarrin's phone number is 704-525-4897.  Thank you in advance for your 
help in moving this aspect of the Alamac transaction forward.

As you will note, it is quite extensive, and I rather doubt we'll receive 
helpful information by simply sending this document to Alamac.  Once you have

to conduct due diligence, please call me so that I can coordinate this effort 
with Michelle Cash and Dolores Lenfest from HR.

Michelle,

Thanks for forwarding the COBRA e-mails to me.  After reading them, I am
confused as to where we stand. The people listed below are on Ecogas COBRA
and I suspect that they have not been presented with the option of switching
to Enron COBRA.  At the very least, I do not think it has been presented to
them in the light that Ecogas COBRA will soon be nonexistent.  Could someone
in your shop  send (or resend) COBRA packets to the people listed below?  I
will send a letter to the same list to let them know that they need to
switch or lose coverage after January 1, 2001. This may be duplicating
earlier efforts, but I want to make sure that no one falls through the
cracks after we dissolve Ecogas.

Thanks,
Kelly Mahmoud

I am the ENA attorney assisting Ozzie Pagan (ENA East Origination) and Glenn 
Wright (Enron Industrial Markets) with the acquisition of two Cogentrix's 
coal fired power plants located in North Carolina.  

I understand from Kathy Neal that you are the appropriate person to be 
involved in the employee/labor due diligence efforts that were initiated by 
Dolores "Dee" Lenfest and then transferred to Kathy Neal.  If I am mistaken 
in believing that you are currently conducting such due diligence with 
Cogentrix's HR representative, would you please contact Glenn Wright 
immediately at 3-1568.  I hope there is no misunderstanding of what is needed 
or who is supposed to be assisting, but if there is, we need to get that 
figured out today.  

Thanks for your help.

Michelle,

Following up on our meeting last week, we need to get a Professional Services 
Agreement in place with Technip USA Corp.  We do not anticipate a need for 
utilizing their resources until Feb/March at the soonest, but as these 
agreements sometimes take a while to negotiate, I believe it appropriate to 
start this one soon.  The contact person at Technip USA is:

 Gerald W. Alves, P.E.

 1990 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 200
 Phone: 713 548 4263
 Fax: 713 548 4013
 Email:  jalves@Technip.com

As discussed, we need a general type Professional Services Agreement so that 
we can draw upon any of their resources at previously established rates, on 
an as required basis.  

Please let me know how we should proceed with getting this agreement in place,

Regards
James

Michelle -

Since this deal is beginning to heat up again, I wanted to get you back in 
the loop.  The earlier e-mail is a good overview of the structure proposed 
for ownership.  Some minor movement of employees may be required, but it is 
not anticipated at this time that many, if any, employees will be 
terminated.  A few key individuals have change of control severance 
agreements, but overall there is no change of control trigger affecting the 
employee base. 

I have attached a copy of the Legal Risk Memo I provided to Mark H. in 
advance of approvals.  It contains a summary of the deal and a general 
outline of the identified issues, including two related to pension issues in 
Quebec.  I thought this might be helpful as a kick-start back into the deal.

Please let me know if you should need anything further or have any questions.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Based upon our discussion yesterday, attached is an outline of the tax 
structure/benefit issues identified.  I believe I captured the items 
identified for each purchase scenario (e.g., a purchase including DSL/DSL(US) 
and a purchase excluding DSL/DLS(US)).

Please review the attached at your convenience and let me know if I missed 
anything or if anything should be added.

I will be forwarding this to our counsel in Canada to ensure that any 
associated benefit issues can be identified.


Thanks.

Attached is a marked version of the Assignment Agreement with our initial 
comments.  In addition to the comments marked, we also have a few other 
questions.

Although we do not object to it being mentioned twice, why is the lease 
assigned pursuant to this Assignment Agreement when there is also a separate 
lease assignment agreement?

How was the employment of the persons listed on Exhibit A to the Assignment 
Agreemement effected?  Were they terminated or did they resign?  Is there any 
documentation regarding this?

We may have further comments after review by Enron and our labor attorney.  
Please call Cle at (713) 221-1314 or me at (713) 221-1131 with your comments.

Kathy,

I am the ENA attorney assisting Ozzie Pagan (ENA East Origination) and Glenn 
Wright (Enron Industrial Markets) with the acquisition of two Cogentrix's 
coal fired power plants located in North Carolina.  

I understand from Kathy Neal that you are the appropriate person to be 
involved in the employee/labor due diligence efforts that were initiated by 
Dolores "Dee" Lenfest and then transferred to Kathy Neal.  If I am mistaken 
in believing that you are currently conducting such due diligence with 
Cogentrix's HR representative, would you please contact Glenn Wright 
immediately at 3-1568.  I hope there is no misunderstanding of what is needed 
or who is supposed to be assisting, but if there is, we need to get that 
figured out today.  

Thanks for your help.

Michelle,

As most Engineering Contractors are beginning to staff up, it is prudent for 
us to have more than one Professional Services Agreements in place for the 
VLNG Front End Engineering Design effort.  Another Company that I have delt 
with in the past, and which also provided assistance to Enron on the Dabhol 
Power Project, is Paragon Engineering Services, Inc.  As requested for 
Technip USA in my e-mail of 5 Dec, please begin negotiations with Paragon 
Engineering Services for a Professional Services Agreement, to be in place in 
the Feb/March timeframe.  The contact person at Paragon is:

 Richard Durfee

Michelle,

Following up on our meeting last week, we need to get a Professional Services 
Agreement in place with Technip USA Corp.  We do not anticipate a need for 
utilizing their resources until Feb/March at the soonest, but as these 
agreements sometimes take a while to negotiate, I believe it appropriate to 
start this one soon.  The contact person at Technip USA is:

 Gerald W. Alves, P.E.
 Commercial Vice President

 1990 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 200
 Phone: 713 548 4263
 Fax: 713 548 4013
 Email:  jalves@Technip.com

As discussed, we need a general type Professional Services Agreement so that 
we can draw upon any of their resources at previously established rates, on 
an as required basis.  

Please let me know how we should proceed with getting this agreement in place,

Regards
James

Michelle - I think Kelly has already sent the #'s to Bracewell and the docs
are in progress.

Kelly - if this is not correct, please make sure Michelle and Bracewell
have the right numbers to fill in the blanks on the employee separation
agreements.  If you've already done so just confirm to Michelle.

Randy,

I haven't received the numbers for the releases for the Ecogas personnel
under contract.   Would you mind sending it to me so that I can send it to
outside counsel to prepare the releases?

Also, could you please send me copies of the Agreements for the 5 Ecogas
employees?  The only ones I have are unsigned.

Thanks a lot.

VOTE CAN BE CONTESTED AFTER NLRB OFFICER OVERSLEPT,
RESCHEDULED

A St. Louis waste hauler was justified in challenging a
representation election won by Teamsters Local 682, when the
National Labor Relations Board Officer in charge of the
initial vote overslept and then unilaterally scheduled a
second election, according to the Eighth Circuit  ("NLRB v.
Superior of Missouri, Inc., "8th Cir., No. 99-3648,
11/7/00).

Considering the circumstances surrounding the "hotly
contested election," the board officer's unilateral action
might have had an impact on the second vote and warranted an
NLRB hearing on Superior of Missouri's objections to the
election, the divided appeals court panel holds.

A dissenting judge finds that the objections raised by the
employer were insufficient to warrant an evidentiary
hearing. He rejects the employer's argument that the board
agent's conduct and the rescheduling of the election "caused
prejudice and destroyed the laboratory conditions necessary
for conducting a fair election."  . . . Page AA-1

FACTORY WORKER EXPOSED TO PORNOGRAPHY HAS NO SEX HARASSMENT
CASE

An electronics factory maintenance specialist whose
co-workers left pornographic pictures around the workplace
for her to find because they believed she had complained
about a racy swimsuit calendar has no claim against her
employer for sexual harassment in violation of Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a federal trial court in Indiana
rules ("Garton v. Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc.,  "S.D.
Ind., No. IP99-1218-C-T/G, 10/25/00).

Plaintiff Aletha Garton "was subjected to boorish, crass and
offensive behavior in the workplace by her co-workers, but
the conduct of which she complains does not rise to the
level of actionable sexual harassment," says Judge Tinder,
granting Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc.'s motion for
summary judgment. . . . Page A-1

PAY PRESSURE UNLIKELY TO RECEDE, WTI PROJECTS

Despite evidence of slower growth across the U.S. economy,
key labor market measures pulled together in the Wage Trend
Indicator suggest wage pressures will remain strong into
next year, according to the latest report released by BNA.

"The new WTI figures suggest there will be no easing in wage
pressures into next year," said economist Joel Popkin, whose
firm developed the indicator for BNA. Labor shortages are
likely to make it hard for many companies to hire workers
over the next few months, the WTI report suggests. . . .

STATE RULES APPLY TO 'HYBRID' SUIT WHILE IN STATE COURT,
NINTH CIRCUIT SAYS

A suit by a member of the International Union of Bricklayers
& Allied Crafts alleging "hiring hall and collective
bargaining violations" by the union and various employers is
not barred by the six-month statute of limitations in
federal law, the Ninth Circuit rules ("Prazak v. Local 1
Int'l Union of Bricklayers & Allied Crafts, "9th Cir., No.
98-36129, 11/13/00). Reversing the decision of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Alaska, the court of
appeals holds that in a "hybrid" claim originally filed in
state court, "if the federal statute of limitations is
initially complied with, the state procedural rules apply
until the case is removed to federal court."

"[William] Prazak's complaint originated in state court,"
writes Judge Nelson. "Thus, state procedural rules should
have been applied until the case was removed to federal
court. The [defendants] could have avoided the application
of Alaska's procedural rules by immediately removing the
case to federal court. As a tactical matter, however, the
[defendants] chose to litigate Prazak's initial lawsuit in
state court. The [defendants] must live with that choice." .

PHILADELPHIA SEIU LOCAL RATIFIES ACCORD WITH BUILDING OWNERS

Janitors and other building maintenance workers represented
by Service Employees International Union Local 36, whose
mail ballots were counted Nov. 14, overwhelmingly approve a
three-year contract with the owners of about 80 commercial
buildings in Philadelphia.

Local 36 Organizing Director Joseph M. Shields says the
agreement with Building Owners Labor Relations Inc., which
bargains for about 24 building owners, provides for wage
increases totaling 10.5 percent and a 70 percent increase in
pension contributions over term.

The contract runs from Oct. 15, 2000, through Oct. 14, 2003,
and covers 2,300 building service workers in Philadelphia. .

SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS JURY MUST DECIDE IF NEUROPATHY VICTIM
IS DISABLED

A former employee of Sears, Roebuck & Co. may proceed with
her discrimination claims under the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the Seventh Circuit rules, holding that a
rational jury could conclude the employee was disabled
("EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., "7th Cir., Nos. 99-3734 and
99-4037, 11/8/00).  Reversing a lower court's grant of
summary judgment, the appeals court says a jury should
determine whether Judith Keane was disabled under the ADA
and therefore entitled to reasonable accommodations.

"It is not our role to come to a decision as to whether
Keane was disabled under the ADA," writes Chief Judge Flaum
on behalf of the panel. "Rather, we only need decide whether
a rational jury, viewing the evidence in the light most
favorable to the plaintiffs could come to such a decision.
We believe they could. Thus, we conclude that summary
judgment should not have been granted on the basis that
Keane was not disabled." . . . Page A-2

Subject: Exempt Job Postings

David:

Your organization currently has seven job postings for Exempt positions that 
mention overtime requirements.  It is recommended that overtime requirements 
be used for non-exempt jobs only.   The use of overtime in association with 
exempt jobs could be a risk in the case of a Department of Labor Wage and 
Hour audit.  Exempt means that the employee is exempt from overtime 
calculations.   Exempt employees are paid on a "salary basis" --this means 
that the employee is paid the same, pre-determined amount for each week they 
work.  The reasoning behind this is that a white collar exempt worker is paid 
for the work done, not for the number of hours worked.    If an employee 
wants to make a claim that we had classified them exempt but they feel they 
should be non-exempt and we have required them to work what we have referred 
to as "overtime" and not compensated them for it , we may be creating a 
liability for ourselves.   I would recommend that for exempt jobs instead of 
using the term "overtime may be required", use "long work hours may be 
required as necessary" or something similar.   I would also recommend that 
the active postings be modified as soon a possible.    Please share this 
information with the recruiters or persons responsible for writing job 
descriptions and your compensation specialists in your group.   If you wish 
to discuss this, please contact me at ext. 39815.

The jobs referenced above for your organization are:

CANADIAN PRIVACY LAW RAISES ANTE

Posted at December 04, 2000 07:41 AM Pacific

NEXT MONTH CANADA will enact a law that offers sweeping
privacy protections for its citizens. But the law may
also create legal obligations and data management
problems for potentially thousands of businesses that
exchange data with firms and subsidiaries in Canada,
the United States' largest trading partner.

On Jan. 1, Canada's Personal Information Protection and
Electronic Documents Act becomes law, requiring
businesses to offer Canadian citizens certain
guarantees regarding the collection and use of
personal data. For example, they must get a customer's
consent before sharing data with affiliates or
commercial partners and must provide access to that
data for review.

Dee,

Ozzie Pagan called me earlier today and informed me that Cogentrix's Tom 
McCarrin (sp?) had started to compile basic employee/employment information 
relative to the two North Carolina power plants that ENA is planning to 
acquire from Alamac Knit Fabrics.  I then spoke to Michelle Cash and she 
agreed with me that it would be best if you would call Mr. McCarrin in order 
to give him guidance as to the specific employee and benefits information 
that you are going to want to see.  I am told that he has not been given the 
Due Diligence Worksheet.

Mr. McCarrin's phone number is 704-525-4897.  Thank you in advance for your 
help in moving this aspect of the Alamac transaction forward.

have been e:mailing you about yesterday and today.  

As you will note, it is quite extensive, and I rather doubt we'll receive 
helpful information by simply sending this document to Alamac.  Once you have 
had a chance to review the type of information that HR needs to have in order 
to conduct due diligence, please call me so that I can coordinate this effort 
with Michelle Cash and Dolores Lenfest from HR.

Subject: iGeneration: Meeting Action Items


Hey Ryan,

Here is the information we discussed in our last meeting regarding an
iGeneration Internet professional staffing solution for Enron.  I know you
are in the process of getting the NDA completed, but I don't want our
progress to be held up by the legal process.

In our last meeting, there were several documents shown that you had not
seen in the past.  Attached, you will find the documents you requested.

Business Model Overview
The "business model.ppt" file contains the slides describing how iGeneration
is creating web professionals and the web job role certificatons/skill sets.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Project Manager Resource
As an enterprise partner, an Project Manager will be assigned to Enron.
This person is a resource of iGeneration and will be responsible for
implementing the solution.  The "project manager.doc" file should provide
you with an overview of the project manager's roles and responsibilities.

Pricing Model
The "iGeneration TalentLink Pricing Grid.doc" will outline standard pricing
and features model.  Please keep in mind, the pricing model does not account
for training, so modifications will have to be made as we progress.

Skill Set Analysis
We have reveiwed all of the web related job reqs listed on Enron's career
web site, and aligned them to iGeneration certifications.  It is quite
compelling how the two align.  I look forward to sharing this information
with you.

I know you wanted to see a detailed version of our certification skill sets.
The files are quite large, so I only included a couple.  Please let me know
if you would like any more.

If there is additional information you would like to see, please let me
know.  I will call you on Friday to discuss scheduling our next meeting.
Will you be available for a call?  And if so, what time will be best for
you.

Thanks,

Charles Bond

Michelle,
?
Sorry, I should have been more clear on the 4 - 6 % vacation  pay. That is 
the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to 
non-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent 
provisions in the collective agreement do not "meet or exceed" the  Act's 
provisions. Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than  the 
provisions in the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply to  
union employees.
?
In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective 
agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the 
year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but  
I'll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may  
actually have to take that time off without any pay if they've already 
elected  to take the pay earlier.
?
For both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued 
in one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be 
entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings.
?
With respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn't one, 
save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The 
letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent 
on Friday last week. If you don't have it, please let me know and  I'll send 
it.
?
There are also position descriptions for every union and  non-union employees 
that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might  also be considered 
part of the contract of employment, though they are not  incorporated into a 
letter of employment.
?
Hope that answers your questions. Please let me know if I may  be of further 
assistance.
?
Dean

Thanks,  Dean.

Two questions have arisen based upon your diligence  summary:

1.? Do you have a copy of the "standard" employment  letter?? We haven't
seen it (or, at least I haven't).
2.? What  is meant by the 4-6% vacation pay?? How does that work?? How  are
the pre-payments made?? Does the person get the money early and then  not
get paid for time off later on?? Additional explanations would be  helpful.

Thanks.

Michelle

Subject:? Celgar - Asbestos  Claims



Peter & Michelle,

Brian Hiebert forwarded to me  Peter's questions regarding the risk of
asbestos litigation at  Celgar.

Under the Workers Compensation Act, employers in British?  Columbia are
required to contribute to an accident fund which provides?  compensation for
injuries or occupational diseases arising out of employment.  In? turn,?the
Act?provides employers statutory immunity  from?damages? in respect of any
personal injury, disablement or  death arising out of and in? the course of
employment.

The  accident fund would cover asbestos claims. There are no
exceptions?which  would allow asbestos litigation?against employers.? The
Act  does?not prohibit?litigation against third parties, eg.?  manufacturers
of asbestos, but employers, as stated, are immune from  such? actions.

Compensation is payable if the worker sustains  pulmonary injury by a
disabling form of asbestosis. We will make the  appropriate enquires about
any? compensation paid to Celgar  employees.

I think that Enron internal would be fine.  I have spoken with one commrcial 
person (Ron Coker)  about her and got rave reviews.  She worked very closely 
with Anthony Duenner so maybe you could call him and Bruce Lundstrum.  Also 
Rob Walls.  Thanks for doing this for me.  I'm still a hostage.

Subject:  HR Manager for GSP


     David Oxley and Michelle, GSP has hired an HR Manager, Louis Fauchaux,
     who will begin work next Tuesday (assuming that all his contingencies
     clear).  His resume is attached. Amy Gambill in Enron HR located Louis
     for us.

     Louis will be here next week, 11/14th-18th, then will return to New
     Jersey 11/27, stay till 12/23, and return 1/2/01.  His wife will come
     up in late January once their house sells.

     David Howe and I have agreed that I will transition with Louis as
     necessary on 11/14-18 and 11/27-12/1 (the days that our schedules
     overlap), and that I will cover the HR function for GSP Thanksgiving
     week when Louis is not here (11/20-11/22).  I will be working on the
     many projects that we have at GSP when I am not transitioning with
     Louis; Louis will take over the day-to-day HR manager functions as
     soon as possible to free me up for this role.  David Howe and I have
     agreed that 12/1 will be my last day on-site at GSP.

     Louis does not have knowledge of Enron, and because of this i believe
     that feedback to you on what is happening at GSP may be even slimmer
     than it has been with me.  I do not know if this will be a concern to
     you; if it is, then you may want to discuss how to address it.  If you
     decide that you want to bring Louis into Houston to meet with Enron
     people, I would prefer that you do not do that until after 12/1 so
     that Louis and i can maximize the benefit of our transition time and
     my project work.

     Hoyt

I spoke with Bonnie yesterday, and she told me that she also had a call to 
return from you.   Just in case y'all didn't have the opportunity to discuss 
it, I did get names from her of those with whom she had previously worked.

She was hired at Enron by Jim Hughes, and is currently working with Bruce 
Lundstrom.  She has also worked with Anthony Duenner, who is now commercial, 
but who was at B&P and worked on the PGE acquisition.

At Reboul, MacMurray she worked with John MacMurray and Isabelle Barzun, but 
all of the attorneys with whom she worked at Milbank have since left the firm.

Hope this is what you needed...

Molly

I was on 38 this a.m. so dropped by your office but you were at a meeting. 
James Mcmillan called me this morning as Ned and I provide legal services on 
the Venezuela LNG project . FYI -  I am working on the commercial documents 
and Ned is working on the construction contract. James called me this morning 
to inquire who the right attorney is that he should be dealing with on 
consulting agreements related to the construction fo the project. ( It does 
get confusing as Ned is handling a consulting agreement for another fellow 
and we have each done consulting agreements for this group in the past - many 
international . )  James advised that you had been in a meeting with him a 
few weeks ago and he understood that you would be assisting and he was 
looking for confirmation of who to contact.  One particular agreement is with 
an individual named Voker Eyerman  who has been working with Enron on a 
contract basis   for 5 years. This individual is due to start work on this 
matter January 8th and James is concerned that this matter be taken care of 
before the holidays. This one seems pretty straight forward and I would be 
happy to do it this week but wanted to run this by you first. 

Let's talk about this at your convenience  today/tomorrow. I told James that 
I would have the time to attend to Voker's contract this week if you were 
unable to do so and that I would discuss this contract and the others with 
you. He is sending me Voker's existing agreement . Look forward to meeting 
you. Nancy 6,7790

LABOR DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES FINAL 'HELPERS' RULE

The Department of Labor releases a final rule to amend
Davis-Bacon Act regulations to allow contractors on federal
and federally assisted construction projects to use
"helpers" when that practice prevails in an area. The final
rule is scheduled for publication in the Nov. 20 "Federal
Register".

The final rule states that "[a] distinct classification of
'helper' will be issued in wage determinations applicable to
work performed on construction projects covered by the labor
standards provisions of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts."
The agency says, however, that the classification will apply
only where: "(i) the duties of the helper are clearly
defined and distinct from those of any other classification
on the wage determination; (ii) the use of such helpers is
an established prevailing practice in the area; and (iii)
the helper is not employed as a trainee in an informal
training program."

A union attorney expresses doubt the rule will succeed in
setting any helper determination, while a representative of
the Associated Builders and Contractors says the
organization is considering litigation against the rule,
which he says "ignores the realities of the workplace and
refuses to recognize a prevailing class of workers.". . .

NLRB RULES 3-1 AGAINST LABOR SUPPLIER FOR REFUSING TO HIRE
ORGANIZER

Tradesmen International Inc., a supplier of skilled
construction workers, committed an unfair labor practice by
refusing to hire a union organizer who challenged a
construction company's compliance with a city bonding
ordinance, the National Labor Relations Board rules in a 3-1
decision ("Tradesmen Int'l Inc., "332 N.L.R.B. No. 107,
10/31/00 [released 11/9/00]). Overturning an administrative
law judge's dismissal of the complaint, Chairman Truesdale
and Members Fox and Liebman find Tradesmen violated Sections
8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act by
refusing to hire Matthew Oakes, a full-time organizer for
Sheet Metal Workers Local 33 in northern Ohio.

"Oakes appeared before [a city board] in furtherance of the
Union's legitimate interest in 'leveling the playing field'
between union and nonunion contractors by ensuring that
[Tradesmen], a nonunion contractor, did not have an unfair
competitive advantage by virtue of its noncompliance with
the surety bond ordinance," the majority writes. Dissenting,
Member Hurtgen asserts that Oakes's activity in testifying
before the city board was not protected because the bond
ordinance "was wholly unrelated to employees' terms and
conditions of employment" and "[t]he bond had no connection
to any labor dispute involving [Tradesmen]." . . . Page A-1,

UFCW, THREE FOOD CHAINS BARGAIN PACTS FOR 16,000 WORKERS IN
ARIZONA

Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union
approve new contracts covering more than 16,000 supermarket
employees at stores operated by Fry's, Safeway Inc., and
ABCO Markets in Arizona.

The three companies bargained separately but simultaneously
with UFCW Local 99, and all three contracts are essentially
the same with minor language differences, according to Local
President William McDonough. The contracts provide wage
increases of $1.20 per hour over term for top-scale
employees. The new food clerk scale goes to $14.17 per hour,
while the top rate for general merchandise clerks is $11.25
per hour. . . . Page A-10

TIME WARNER, DOL SETTLE CHARGES FIRM MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS

Time Warner Inc. and the Labor Department announce that they
have settled for $5.5 million charges that the company
misclassified hundreds of employees as independent
contractors or temporary workers, denying them benefits
coverage in violation of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act. DOL filed suit against the company in October
1998 alleging that, since at least 1990, the publishing
giant regularly misclassified workers and failed to examine
whether they met internal and common-law criteria for
benefits eligibility.

The settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York provides that certain
temporary workers and independent contractors who provided
contingent worker services for Time Inc. from 1992 to 1997
and who execute the appropriate documentation provided for
under the terms of the settlement will receive proceeds from
the agreement, the company says, adding that it is not
admitting any liability or wrongdoing. According to the
Labor Department, the settlement may benefit hundreds of
employees of Time Inc. . . . Page A-11

DELAY IN TRANSFER SOUGHT BY EMPLOYEE NOT ADVERSE ACTION

Boeing Co.'s delay in transferring an engineer to a job away
from his supervisor, whom he had accused of harassing him,
does not amount to an adverse employment action, the Tenth
Circuit rules, affirming summary judgment for the company
("Amro v. Boeing Co., "10th Cir., No. 99-3281, 11/14/00).

"He cites no case ... which holds that the mere delay in
obtaining a desired transfer, in the absence of some other
negative or unfavorable effect from the delay, constitutes
an adverse action," Judge Anderson writes for the court. The
only consequence of the transfer delay, the court finds, was
that Amro was forced to face "unpleasant and vulgar
encounters" with his supervisor. The supervisor's conduct,
however, was not "itself sufficiently negative and pervasive
to create an adverse employment action." . . . Page A-6

ARBITRATOR'S AWARD VACATED WHERE UMW DENIED CHANCE TO MAKE
CASE

An arbitrator exceeded his authority under a collective
bargaining agreement when he failed to allow the United Mine
Workers to present evidence that Marrowbone Development Co.
violated the agreement by assigning union work to nonunion
employees, the Fourth Circuit rules, upholding a district
court's decision to vacate the award ("International Union,
United Mine Workers of America v. Marrowbone Dev. Co., "4th
Cir., No. 00-1262, 11/14/00).

"Here, the arbitrator told the Union to meet with
Marrowbone, gather information, negotiate further, and, if
the dispute was still not resolved, present evidence and
argument at a March 26 arbitration hearing," writes Judge
Motz. "Yet the arbitrator issued his award without ever
holding that hearing or affording the Union the opportunity
to present the evidence it had been prepared to offer at the
abbreviated February hearing." "Therefore, despite our usual
deference, we cannot sanction the decision of an arbitrator
who failed to provide a signatory to the arbitration
agreement a full and fair hearing," Motz says. . . . Page

Michelle - I think Kelly has already sent the #'s to Bracewell and the docs
are in progress.

Kelly - if this is not correct, please make sure Michelle and Bracewell
have the right numbers to fill in the blanks on the employee separation
agreements.  If you've already done so just confirm to Michelle.

Christopher -

Based upon your memo and our due diligence effort to date, is there any 
indication of (a) any steps Daishowa has taken to put the committee required 
under the Pay Equity Act or (b) any increase in compensation that would be 
consistent with the Pay Equity Act and therefore enable Daishowa to dispense 
with the need for a committee?  Is there any way to currently assess what 
potential liabilities could be or to view any industry data on this issue 
that may indicate how extensive liability could be???

The main concern is that we are negotiating with Daishowa to be in a position 
to undertake, as of closing, all responsibilities associated with all matters 
disclosed, unless there is a legal noncompliance issue (e.g., failure to 
maintain proper permits).  Since the requirements of the Pay Equity Act have 
not been identified to management as a concern, I need to ensure that this is 
a real issue (mostly from a $'s exposure standpoint) vs. something so remote 
that it should not even be discussed.

Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

David, I haven't had a chance to read the documents that Marlow provided, but 
I did want to respond to your message below. 

Currently, the deal makers are not aware of who to contact within HR when 
they are working on deals.  An example is today I received a call from 
Findley Biggerstaff explaining that he is working on a pulp mill deal in 
British Columbia.  This is a unionized facility with approximately 400 
employees.  Given that this is a unionized facility, we need to have time to 
review contracts and identify any and all risk of acquiring such a facility.  

The aggressive timeline for this deal is December 15, 2000 and they are 
actually working on the 2nd round bidding process.  So with that, my first 
thought is that we need to get our names out there to be pulled in on the 
front end.

We actually have a couple of different boiler plate templates that I work 
with when participating on any due diligence team.   I work close with 
Michelle Cash (legal matters), Dee Lenfest (domestic benefit matters), Rich 
Johnson (labor relations) and Tim Callahan (international benefits).

The majority of the acquisitions will be merchant assets in which we will not 
integrate into Enron businesses, but we need time to determine how benefits, 
payroll and other issues will be handled.    

To build our capabilities is to be included on the front end so that we can 
prepare our risk analysis and provide professional input on these 
acquisitions.

Marlow,

This makes interesting reading. Kathy, I would be particularly interested in 
your views of what we need to do to build our capabilities around 
acquisitions in particular given the likely heavy activity in your area over 
the next 12 months. Seems to me we have an excellent window of opportunity to 
build some support before we get inundated.

Tim/Cindy, will you look at this also and give me your thoughts.

David,

One of the white boards requests information on successful M&A integration.  
I wrote a research paper on the subject in grad school that I thought I'd 
share with you (if you have time to read it).  It highlights the following:
M&A statistics, 
Post-Acquisition Culture Strategies, 
Tools for Successful Post-Acquisition Management (beginning on page 4) 

In addition, I've attached another research paper I wrote specifically on 
Change Management that might be applicable.

Michelle,

Tana & I will be facilitating several brown bag interview trainings next 
week.  Please review the portion of our handout titled "Legal Guidelines."  
Let me know if you think we need to add or delete anything.  Our goal is to 
cover the basic do's and don'ts.  Are there any interview questions that our 
managers regularly ask that drive you crazy?  That is to say, what are the 
most common interviewing errors that get Enron into hot water?

Thanks,
Dave

JUDGE APPROVES $9 MILLION SETTLEMENT OF HARASSMENT SUIT
AGAINST FORD

A year after Judge Bucklo criticized a conciliation
agreement between the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and Ford Motor Co. for lacking "bite," the judge
approves a $9 million revised agreement settling class
allegations of sexual harassment at two of the company's
Chicago plants ("Warnell v. Ford Motor Co., " N.D. Ill., No.
98 C 1503, 11/17/00). Bucklo of the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois approves a settlement
agreement between Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford and hundreds of
current and former female employees of the company's Chicago
Heights Stamping Plant and its Chicago Assembly Plant.

The settlement agreement resolving claims under Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act modifies a $7.5 million
conciliation agreement affecting the same two plants that
was reached between the EEOC and Ford in September 1999. The
settlement enhances monetary terms for the plaintiffs and
places the settlement process under judicial supervision.
"What this does is take the conciliation agreement ... [and]
incorporates that into something larger and gives it some
teeth," according to plaintiffs' attorney Darnley Stewart.
Bucklo criticized the lack of any legal enforceability in
the earlier agreement one month after it was heralded by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as an innovation. .

NLRB RULES 2-1 ALBERTSON'S ILLEGALLY BARRED TWO UNIONS'
SOLICITATION

Albertson's Inc. committed unfair labor practices in
violation of the National Labor Relations Act by barring two
unions' members from distributing handbills outside 11
grocery stores in Oregon and Washington, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Albertson's Inc.,
"332 N.L.R.B. No. 104, 10/31/00 [released 11/8/00]).
Chairman Truesdale and Member Liebman decide the grocery
store chain violated Section 8(a)(1) by forbidding United
Food and Commercial Workers Local 555 from soliciting
employees to join the union and stopping International
Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 582 from soliciting
Albertson's customers to boycott products from a dairy
company involved in a labor dispute.

Finding Albertson's regularly granted access to the
Salvation Army, a number of youth and school organizations,
and veterans groups to solicit donations and sales, the
majority decides this activity exceeded "the small number of
isolated beneficent acts that the Board regards as a narrow
exception to an otherwise valid, nondiscriminatory
no-solicitation policy." Dissenting, Member Hurtgen
maintains Albertson's did not discriminate against union
activity because it drew "a line between (1) solicitations
by charitable groups which are well known to the community
and (2) solicitations by political groups, commercial groups
which seek to sell goods or services, and charitable groups
which are unknown to the community." . . . Page A-6

TYSON'S FAILURE TO FORM NONCOMPETE DOOMS TRADE SECRETS
LAWSUIT

Tyson Foods Inc.'s failure to protect its alleged trade
secrets with a noncompetition agreement between it and three
former executives doomed its lawsuit against the competing
poultry producer to which the executives defected, the
Supreme Court of Arkansas rules ("ConAgra Inc. v. Tyson
Foods Inc.,  "Ark.,  No. 00-446,  11/16/00).

The trial court erred in determining that it was inevitable
that the executives would disclose Tyson's trade secrets to
their new employer, ConAgra Inc., Judge Brown finds. Tyson,
Brown says, failed to established that it had any secrets to
protect because it had in place no protection against
postemployment revelation of confidential information. The
high court reverses the lower court's injunctions barring
ConAgra from misappropriating any of Tyson's trade secrets,
Jerry Dowd and John Curren from engaging in sales and
marketing of poultry for one year, and Mike Hamblin from
continuing a marketing relationship with certain clients.

DELAYED RETIREMENT NOT NECESSARY IF WORKERS SAVE MORE

If workers' incomes continue to grow at a rate of a 1
percent to 2 percent over the next several decades, the
workers can use those increases to finance longer, more
comfortable retirements, an economist tells a group of
researchers at a hearing sponsored by the Senate Special
Committee on Aging.

The population of older Americans continues to grow, causing
increases in the costs of pensions, Social Security, and
health benefits. However, worker productivity is likely to
keep pace with those costs, according to Gary Burtless, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
D.C.-based think tank. Because more women are in the
workforce, he says, the amount of time Americans between the
ages of 25 and 54 spend at work has risen in the last 30
years. The increased work hours can help pay for shorter
hours and longer retirements after age 55.  . . . Page A-10

COURT ENFORCES ARBITRATION AFTER SEVERING UNCONSCIONABLE
PROVISION

A plaintiff may be compelled to arbitrate her pregnancy
discrimination claim under a binding pre-dispute arbitration
agreement with her employer, even though a provision
requiring her to bear all costs of court and administrative
proceedings is unconscionable and must be severed from the
rest of the agreement, the California Court of Appeal rules
("Shubin v. William Lyon Homes Inc.", Cal. Ct. App.,  No.
A088858, 11/14/00).

Relying on a recent California Supreme Court decision, the
court holds that a provision in the arbitration agreement
was illegal that required employees to pay all costs and
fees for any court action brought by the employee, even if
she prevailed. Such a clause "chills the exercise of the
employee's right to legitimately pursue her claim before the
[Department of Fair Employment and Housing]," the appeals
court says. But that provision could be severed "without
adversely affecting the central purpose of the contract," it
says. . . . Page A-2

NEWSPAPER GUILD MEMBERS STRIKE SEATTLE DAILIES

Some 1,000 news, business, advertising, and circulation
employees at the"Seattle Times" and "Seattle
Post-Intelligencer" strike the newspapers in a contract
dispute over wages and other working conditions. Members of
the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild reject a final
contract offer from the employers and also vote against
postponing the previously authorized strike, according to
the first edition of the union's online newspaper, the
"Seattle Union Record". Union members reject a final
contract offer from the papers that included hourly
increases that averaged 55 cents per year over a six-year
period, the union says. . . . Page A-8

HIGHLIGHTS

D.C. CIRCUIT RULES AIRLINE ILLEGALLY OUSTED ALPA WORKERS
FROM PROFIT-SHARING

Cargo airline Atlas Air Inc. violated the Railway Labor Act
by excluding pilots and flight engineers from participation
in a profit-sharing plan "for the sole reason" that they
voted for union representation, the District of Columbia
Circuit rules ("Atlas Air Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n,
"D.C. Cir., No. 99-7223, 11/21/00). Reversing a district
court's grant of summary judgment to Atlas Air, the appeals
court acknowledges that employers covered by the act may
change working conditions when no bargaining contract exists
between the parties.

However, Judge Sentelle decides "where the challenged
modification to the status quo is far from merely formal,
and is in fact the equivalent of a substantial decrease in
compensation having a real and material impact on the
conditions of employment, and is justified on no other
grounds than union certification, we may presume that the
carrier's actions were motivated by anti-union animus and
are in violation of RLA Section 2, Third and Fourth."

Atlas Air sued for a declaratory judgment that its exclusion
of some 550 newly unionized pilots and flight engineers from
the profit-sharing plan was legal and that it could make
more changes in employment conditions before collective
bargaining began. The Air Line Pilots Association
counterclaimed, alleging the airline interfered with
workers' right to organize. . . . Page AA-1

PROBE OF HARASSMENT CHARGE AGAINST UNION ADVOCATES BARRED BY
NLRB

A North Carolina diesel engine firm violated the rights of
two employees by investigating and then documenting a
harassment complaint waged against them for distributing a
union organizing newsletter, the National Labor Relations
Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Consolidated Diesel Co.,"332
N.L.R.B. No. 94, 10/31/00 [released Nov. 7]).

Although neither of the two employees was disciplined, the
board says that the process still had the potential of
interfering with their rights to engage in protected
activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations
Act.

"Clearly [Consolidated Diesel Co.'s] requiring employees who
engage in protected concerted activity to submit to a
process with the potential for interrogation about protected
activity, discipline, discharge, and permanent
documentation, simply because some person at one time
claimed to be harassed by that activity, has a reasonable
tendency to restrain the exercise of Section 7 rights,"
Chairman Truesdale and Member Fox write. Dissenting Member
Hurtgen finds no violation and "nothing coercive" in the
actions. . . . Page A-1

VIGILANCE REQUIRED TO CLASSIFY COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS' WORK
UNDER FLSA

With computer professionals becoming more integral to the
work of high-tech, and even not-so-high-tech, companies, it
has become more important for employers to understand and
apply correctly the Section 13 (a) exemption under the Fair
Labor Standards Act overtime law for computer professionals,
according to attorneys interviewed by BNA.

Employers seeking to apply the overtime exemption must be
certain that the work performed by the "computer
professional" at issue falls within the parameters of the
statute. In addition to considering the statute, employers
determining whether employees are overtime-exempt must "walk
through" the implementing regulations issued by the
Department of Labor in 1992 and "make sure" that their
computer workers fall within the guidelines, according to
management attorneys. . . . Page C-1

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a3r5h2n1_


FLSA APPLIES TO HOME FOR MENTALLY RETARDED

A nonprofit organization that provides community living
residences for mentally retarded adults must comply with the
Fair Labor Standards Act when it calculates overtime payment
rates for its employees, the Third Circuit affirms ("Madison
v. Resources for Human Dev., "3d Cir., No. 99-1821,
11/15/00). Staff members of Resources for Human Development
Inc. cannot be considered FLSA-exempt "domestic service
employees" because RHD residences are not private homes, the
court decides. Clients do not have full control over access
to their residences and do not have "unfettered freedom in
their day-to-day conduct."

However, the appeals court remands the case to a lower court
to decided whether cash payments from RHD's cafeteria
benefits plan should be taken into account when calculating
employees' overtime payments. The district court improperly
relied on an informal interpretive guidance when it granted
summary judgment to the plaintiffs, the court finds. . . .

 NUMBER OF EMPLOYER-PAID HOLIDAYS ABOUT THE SAME AS LAST
YEAR'S

Employees can look forward to about as much paid time off
this Christmas and New Year's season as last, according to
BNA's latest annual survey of year-end holiday plans.

Almost half of the responding employers (49 percent) will
grant three or more paid days off for the holiday season
this year, little changed from 50 percent in 1999-2000, when
the national holidays fell on Saturdays, and slightly more
than the 47 percent of employers in 1995-96, when Christmas
and New Year's last landed on Mondays. Employers' holiday
scheduling continues to be slightly more conservative than a
decade ago, when, in 1989-90, a year when the national
holidays also fell on Monday, six out of 10 firms gave
workers at least three paid days. . . . Page B-1

STUDY SHOWS 15 PERCENT OF JOB SEEKERS USE INTERNET

A new study of Internet use by job seekers shows that in
1998 about 15 percent of all unemployed people actively
looking for new jobs turned to various World Wide Web sites
in conducting their search.

About 7 percent of employed persons had used the Internet to
look for a new job in 1998, a higher proportion than shown
in earlier studies of traditional job-search methods,
according to economists Peter Kuhn and Mikal Skuterud in an
article published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
economists find little impact so far of increasing use of
the Internet on public employment agencies.. . . Page A-3 ,

Michelle, I took advantage of the long weekend and wanted to share this good
news with you first because you have been supportive of my digital endeavors.

Color me excited!  My digital waterfall electronic storefront is open for
business.

You may have seen some of the images in the Oregon 2000 vacation report on my
personal web site.

I've placed the best of the lot for viewing and purchase on the new
storefront site.

The address is:  http://nwdigifalls.homestead.com

Come linger awhile.  I think you will enjoy a tour of the gallery.  The
images are magnificent!

Michelle, don't worry about purchasing; just enjoy the views.  I wanted to
show off my web design skills and share these delightful waterfall images

Michelle
 
Fortunately we have already received some advice on the effects of bankruptcy 
on NOxTech from our patent counsel, which is attached. This is very promising 
and appears to put us very much in control of the intellectual property. 
Turning to the employment of the key individual, Bruce Sudduth, you will see 
from the covering email that we might want to take some immediate steps to 
preserve our ability to access him in the event bankruptcy is declared, 
however I am not convinced on the limited amount of information that we would 
not be running the risk of a tortious interference claim, unless we agreed it 
with the directors of NOxTech first and then proposed it to Bruce. What do 
you think?

Marcus,
In case you had not seen this yet, attached is a memorandum we had prepared
at Bart Clark's request anticipating NOxTech's possible bankruptcy.  I have
forwarded your contact information to Bill Bates, and he should be calling
you tomorrow.

Best regards,
Dave

Michelle, this barely intelligible email contains the draft letter from 
Noxtech's President, Ralph Slone.  We averted this crisis by advancing 
Noxtech $50,000 against the expenses incurred on our behalf by Noxtech that 
are reimbursable under the License Agreement.  I spoke with Ralph Slone 
today, by the way.  He thinks PBCC, his lender, will have comments back on 
the Warrant Agreement today.  I will keep you apprised.

Best regards,
Vince

Vince, cannot make its payroll for the end of  the month (October) if it does 
not receive the advance to cover our expenses as  described in attached 
letter. I have not sent the letter to Mike or George. I  would prefer to 
resolve this problem between you and I. If I haven't received a  definitive 
answer from you by Monday afternoon I will take that to mean no. I  will then 
send the letter to the Cc list. Regards.?

Michelle,
?
We faxed a 57-page package to you on Friday. Let me know if  you didn't 
receive it. In the meantime, my secretary is faxing you the KPMG  letter to 
Doug Cargill, which is identical to all the other letters that were  sent to 
non-union employees.

>>>  <Michelle.Cash@enron.com> 12/12/00 08:55AM >>>

Dean, to  whom did you send the package last week?

Subject:? Re: Celgar - Asbestos  Claims



Michelle,

Sorry, I should have been more clear on  the 4 - 6 % vacation? pay. That is
the statutory minimum under the  Employment Standards Act. It? applies to
non-union employees. It only  applies to union employees if the? equivalent
provisions in the  collective agreement do not "meet or exceed" the? Act's
provisions.  Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than
the provisions in  the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply
to? union  employees.

In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees  the? collective
agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at  the start of? the
year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for  non-union employees,
but? I'll check on that. When their actual time for  vacation comes up, they
may? actually have to take that time off without  any pay if they've already
elected? to take the pay earlier.

For  both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned? and  accrued
in one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar  employees? will
be entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of  their 2000? earnings.

With respect to the standard employment  contract, there really? isn't one,
save for the letter of employment  that KPMG sent out to all? employees. The
letter from KPMG to Doug  Cargill is a sample. It was in the? package I sent
on Friday last week.  If you don't have it, please let me know and? I'll
send it.

There  are also position descriptions for every union and? non-union
employees  that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might? also  be
considered part of the contract of employment, though they are  not
incorporated into a letter of employment.

Hope that answers your  questions. Please let me know if I may? be of
further  assistance.

Dean

>>>?  <Michelle.Cash@enron.com> 12/11/00 01:25PM  >>>

Thanks,? Dean.

Two questions have arisen based  upon your diligence? summary:

1.? Do you have a copy of the  "standard" employment? letter?? We haven't
seen it (or, at least I  haven't).
2.? What? is meant by the 4-6% vacation pay?? How  does that work?? How? are
the pre-payments made?? Does the  person get the money early and then? not
get paid for time off later  on?? Additional explanations would be?  helpful.

Thanks.

Michelle

Subject:? Celgar - Asbestos?  Claims



Peter & Michelle,

Brian Hiebert forwarded to  me? Peter's questions regarding the risk of
asbestos litigation at?  Celgar.

Under the Workers Compensation Act, employers in  British?? Columbia are
required to contribute to an accident fund  which provides?? compensation
for
injuries or occupational  diseases arising out of employment.? In?  turn,?the
Act?provides employers statutory immunity?  from?damages? in respect of any
personal injury, disablement  or? death arising out of and in? the course  of
employment.

The? accident fund would cover asbestos claims.  There are no
exceptions?which? would allow asbestos  litigation?against employers.? The
Act? does?not  prohibit?litigation against third parties, eg.
manufacturers
of  asbestos, but employers, as stated, are immune from? such?  actions.

Compensation is payable if the worker sustains? pulmonary  injury by a
disabling form of asbestosis. We will make the? appropriate  enquires about
any? compensation paid to Celgar?  employees.
