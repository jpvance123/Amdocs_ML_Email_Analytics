Scott - 

Please zero out the demand charges for Virginia Natural Gas November 2001 production on the following deals:

602027
602028
602021
602018
602019
602020

I also need the deal 1020386 price for November 2001 to be changed to zero.  The volumes need to stay the way they are but this is a pass through charge to the customer and they have paid this amount to Transco.

Please call me if you have any questions and please let me know when this is done so I can process it in the back office.

Thanks for your assistance.

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 10. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Kim,

Deal # QR4659.1 & 3 are in the FT-CAND-ERMS book as of yesterday afternoon.  Should these trades be terminated or do I need to send an invoice to Entergy-Koch?

Please advise,

Did you receive confirmation from Cecilia that these were indeed moved?  Entergy Koch is one of the entities that Mechelle Stevens is questioning.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

Phillip - sorry for such a late response but I have been on vacation.  I looked up the books mentioned below and the INTRA-CENTRAL-PHY book is active.  I do not see the INTRA-EAST-PHY book in risktrac.  Please let me know if I need to create additional books.

Thanks,
Susan

Just got off the phone with Dave Forster.

Currently we are in dispute with Sempra over the terms & interpretations of the verbal & written agreement with Sempra regarding their transactions. They have terminated all agreements & all transactions. The only open 'issue' is the settlement of those transactions.

So, please add CP# 57508, Sempra Energy Trading Corp. to the list previously submitted.

Thank you,
Cyndie

We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 8. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

Phillip,
Last week we discussed me spending time with you one morning to see exactly what it is that I will be doing.  I imagine it will be more of an observing lesson than anything else, but I would like to stop by Thursday morning.  If you are available, what time should I come down there?

Zac

I started a spreadsheet for us to keep track of our books, traders, file names, etc.

It is saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\Controls\Trader Matrix.xls

Please add any other fields you think we should have.  Jeff mentioned he wants to be able to quickly tell what books belong to what traders, O'neil had this idea.
Is everyone ready to start setting up their books today?  Has Scott Neal gotten back to you yet Phillip?

As I am sure you are experiencing as well all the fire drills that are currently going on around here, I have been running since I got back from vacation.  Believe me when I say this is a high priority for me as well because of all the potential P&L fallout for the traders who have been entering this information.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Subject:        RE: NICOR 

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks

Phillip,
 
There are several deals in TAGG with an ENA book name of UN-NY; examples are N67489.6 and N67489.C.  I am trying to find out the long description for the book and where the deal value would be captured.  Can you help?  The examples above were set up in 2000 and run through 2003.
 
Best regards,
 
Rachel

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Is this value on these deals rought 8K?
If so, tell portfolio acct to put them in and generate a PMA for the gas books.  It is not worth investigating for such a small number and the deal ended 12/01.  Are these the only four deals you have with the gas desk?

Per John Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.  That is why this deal was killed.  You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.  Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?

Phillip,

Below is the information for the CGAS book that was killed on 12/13/01.  This book should have liquidated in December.  Can we get this deal back?

I know we have moved this meeting already, but since I have very little info ( only what I read on Yahoo!)
I think we should wait till next week to meet.  So I am going to cancel.

I have given Leslie, Jeff , Stacey and Rita,  Enron BUCKS cards.  Make them buy you a drink.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Thanks for you patients and continued understanding.

That's the address that I sent it to that was returned.

Went to Florida yesterday morning and came back this morning.

I think they have finally changed the way our addresses work.  It is
phillip.m.love@enron.com for now.  We will see if it changes to UBS.
Where

Also, all physical weapon-X tabs are linking to an old east book.  I didn't touch that tab yet, we don't know if we're using weapon-X or sasqwatch.

Hey Gang,

Just a heads up, but you may need to edit your Copy Physical Macro in your P&L's that are saved in the Netco/Regions folder... The changes were simply renaming sheets in the Macro... O

Ok. No time frame we are just hanging in there and just waiting like most people.  
I already have an offer from a law firm and I'm waiting to hear back from Baylor College of Medicine for
the second interview.  So I know I will find something, I just wasn't ready to leave here yet.  Let me know
when you are least busy today and I'll come by.

 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - The =
Lie Downs Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's=
 game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the=
 game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lew=
is , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, L=
ewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went in=
to effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or reh! ab! ilit=
ate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will wor=
k toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OA=
K - One Man Show Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game =
with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back=
. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TE=
N - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports,=
 Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That=
 makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN=
 - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in ques=
tion for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He=
 threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published=
 reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recomme=
nd McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia a=
fter missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave =
Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would "be ready to play the m=
ajority of the game." His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wo=
uldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense=
.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/16/01 Sanders=
 (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed=
 as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're com=
pletely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matc=
hup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as =
he's abl! e ! to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 11/=
16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterba=
ck for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth startin=
g on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Lie Downs Updated=
 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack =
of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better q=
uarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your=
 starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - The Executione=
rs Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but =
he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for =
finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Al=
len and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mexi=
mullets Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game again=
st the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this se=
ason, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to pos=
t solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Update=
d 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and i=
s a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defens=
e that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start=
.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a bi=
g game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two s=
cores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post =
huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable I=
ndianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 1=
1/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, post=
ing 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapo=
lis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson th=
is week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis  , RB WAS - The Executioners Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slow=
ly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once a=
gain emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 a=
gainst a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Ba=
nks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, t=
hrowing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup th=
is weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he=
's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook=
 , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent =
this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four game=
s. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, s=
o starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR W=
AS - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in=
 his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have =
a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him i=
s a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/0=
1 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fant=
asy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tou=
gh New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper =
leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - One Man Show Updated 11/16/01 Holt continu=
es to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three tou=
chdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend,=
 but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team ba! se! d on his potent=
ial to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated =
11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's =
still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and th=
e formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on =
his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - oops, I did it a=
gain Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that =
he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every =
week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie=
 Conwell , TE STL - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few=
 down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. =
With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Co=
nwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Ric=
hard Huntley , RB CAR - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be t=
he likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprise=
d if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week=
 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Meximullets Updated 11/16=
/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.=
 He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a =
real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/01 Wall=
s has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of t=
he better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Franc=
isco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR =
- Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat prod=
uctive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had s=
ome success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so sta=
rting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Fat Bastards Update=
d 11/16/01 Favre! h! as been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the le=
ague this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerab=
le secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB -=
 Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers=
, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy play=
er. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of t=
ight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - N=
ot So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the =
NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's=
 a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to s=
trong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  Teams, Rosters  [IMAGE]=

Haven't heard back from you all regarding the Canadian P/B/I books for Central.  We need to set these up asap in Netco database for testing.  John, have you got the request from Kam or Phillip on this?  If so, would you email me the request together with the CP IDs in Global?  If not, please send John the book request (book code cannot be MC, please assign something else).

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Cecilia

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Also as per our conversation with Kam, all PB-HDG books set up from the original list have been removed from the database as they were not supposed to be set up in Tagg/Erms.

I started calculating the bankruptcy book last night for the credit group.  This needs to be done nightly.  I may be out a few days so if I am can someone else take this over from me please?  We can also use these to check daily for counterparties that have been moved incorrectly.

The file is in O:\erms\1intra\west\Bankruptcy post-ids.xls

If the central books have 2 set up then I'll leave MC assigned to GD and we need another set of central books set up for P/B/I.  Please have the new books set up in Global first (with new book codes, not MC) then email me the new IDs, book names, book codes and region codes.

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 11. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

The file was too big to email.  It contains all financial deals (P,B,I,GD) in the active NG-PRICE book.  It does not contain any option deals.  I will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  It is saved in O:/_Dropbox.

Subject:	RE: NICOR

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip,

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks
Darla Saucier

Enron has consented to allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to search the Enron Building and to interview employees regarding allegations of document destruction.  The company encourages all employees to fully cooperate with the FBI.

The company has retained Michael Levy and his law firm Swidler, Berlin, Shereff, Friedman, to advise any employee regarding this matter and to be present with them during any interviews by government investigators.  If you would like to speak with an attorney, please contact Ned Crady of the Legal Department at 3-4558 or contact Michael Levy's office in Washington, D.C. at 202-295-8414 and they will direct you to him here in Houston.

FYI....

To keep things consistent all of the traders, except the financial group, will use their physical books to log in for EOL.

Kam,

As we discussed this morning, the traders will be using their physical books to log onto EOL with the exception of the financial desk (John Arnold and team).  Behind the scenes, EOL will  set these traders up in the Counterparty Alternates table to have the books "flip" to the respective financial book when a financial trade is hit.  

Also, any word yet on the traders wanting a different book for price, basis and index.  We are still under the assumption that the trades will book under one book.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

Dawn already notified us the other day about this but nobody confirmed me what to use at that time.  I'll change the Tagg bridge program to read OLT instead of EOL today.

We need to stop calling the UBS online trades EOL.  We also need to change the downstream systems - especially the auto confirms to something other than EOL for the transaction ID - or anything else.  I spoke to Dave Forster about this and he suggested we use OLT (on-line-trade) and OLT transaction number.   

Unfortunately the new website for trading does not have an exciting name (www.ubswenergy.com) - so unlike EnronOnline - it does not stand out.  

I realize it may take some time to change everywhere in all the systems it says "Enron" - but as you know, we definitely need to do it wherever the customers are involved.

Sasquatch 2002 is now saved out into:

O, erms, 1intra, financialsdb.

Please save it onto your c drive before using it.

I made one quick adjustment. There is no need to put in your cpr dollars and volumes to get your wacog. The program will calculate your UA4 day-by-day and the P&l's calculate the values. You still need to put in your wacog's in the P&l's. 

Again, please send me all "wishes" about the program and I will try to accomodate all requests. I would like to roll the final product out to everyone in two weeks and plan to have a brown bag on it at that time. In the meantime, please feel free to ask me any questions about the program. Thanks again for your attention.

Pat

I am not sure what happened with the update I sent out...it seemed to have cancelled it in some people's calendars.  If you are still able to make it please come by.   It will be for no more than 30 minutes.

Today at 1:30 in room EB19c1

Thank you and I do apologize for the inconvenience.

Due to changes to the database relative to the change to "Netco", the curve files will need to be upgraded.  The majority of the files
will be able to be upgraded by each individual with a minimal of effort.  Older files will take extra effort.  Can you have your people 
identify how many old files we have.  The old files can be identified by looking at the "Publish" tab in the Admin box located at F2:G3.

The old files will only have the button  (Reset Rows/Columns)

The new files will have 3 buttons   (Reset Rows/Columns)
                                                  (Load Modules)(Re Init)


Knowing which files still have the old format will help the IT group plan for this migration.
If you could have your people check and get back to me as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.

Thanks

They are located in the Netco Directory under west/curves/CA BASIS NEW and WEST BASIS NEW.  I am still working on GDY and Phy/GD.  The Phy/GD is in the new format and will be located in the same directory as the above, with the title West phys curves.

Thanks.  Can we combine the file for Gas Daily and Physical Index curves - I will be updating this file and the Balance of the month file.  Keith Holst will update the CA basis, while Frank Ermis updates the ROX and SW file.

Subject:	phys/gd curve file

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

I really hate it for them.

>>> <Phillip.M.Love@enron.com> 01/08/02 12:49PM >>>
looks like Florida will not be very good next year.  They are losing
their
best players to the draft.  All three of their receivers and their
best
cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft
today.
Add to that they can not get a coach to sign on.  Shanahan just turned
it
down, they are now going to New Orleans offensive coordinator.  See
what
happens.  Did you get your pool cover fixed?

   I've been following the story in the paper since last week.  If you
look
   real close at the story though, you'll see that all these national
   offensive leads were for small schools (NAIA, Division 1AA, etc.).
But,
   still good news.  I forget the name of the Jaquars quarterback, but
he
   has nothing but praise for Petrino.

   Now, if we can just get a defensive coordinator.  Wouldn't hurt to
have
   some defensive players too.

   Things are okay here.  Kind of cold.  Ready for spring.

   >>> "Love, Phillip M." <Phillip.M.Love@ENRON.com> 01/08/02 08:28AM
>>>
   Saw this morning we hired Petrino.  I did not realize how successful
he
   has been at the college level.  Three times his offenses have led
the
   nation in offense.  He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.  He
has
   three playing in the NFL now that he developed.  I think this might
be a
   real good move.  How are things there?

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

Yesterday's list of in the money CP's did not change.  We will forward a list of out of the money CP's shortly.  We will also send IT the list so that they can begin moving them to another book.  There are appox 140 CP's so the move will take some time.

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks 
Darla Saucier

Subject:	Benefits

All,

The last information I had on Benefits was that Enron benefits would cease on Feb. 8 and UBS benefits would start on Feb. 16.

Obviously, there is a gap here, and UBS/Enron are working to put something in place to cover this period.

If you have anything elective, you might find that it would be simpler if you were to avoid this gap period.

Dave

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 82. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

Thanks.  Let me know if and when they get out of hand again.  I am reviewing the majority of forms now myself before they go to you.  The bad ones go back to Settlements, good ones go to Risk.

                         SEC CHAMPIONSHIP

The 2001 SEC Championship game will be played at the Georgia Dome in
Atlanta on December 8.  Since the team representing the western
division may not be determined until after the LSU-Auburn game on Dec.
1, seven days before the Championship Game, the SEC office has
instructed all teams in contention to begin processing orders at this
time.  Since we are dealing with such a short turn around, we have to
prepare now as if we are in the game. If we do not represent the
Western Division, your credit card charge will be cancelled.  If we
are in the  Championship Game, we will be prepared to mail the tickets
after  December 1.  It is imperative that  orders are received by the
November 20 deadline. We will not have the luxury of filling any
orders received after November 20 based on priority. We will
need a street address and daytime phone number, because the tickets
will be shipped via UPS Next Day Air.  If you need to change your
address or have any questions please send to:
to:mailto:tickets@auburn.edu.
Address changes can not be made on the order form.  You will save $5
when ordering via the internet.

Your customer number is:  42077

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.

That deal should have already been moved. It was on Stacey Richardson's Master Cumulative list as having been submitted with the "Auto-termination" project she was working on. If it is still showing in the "Live" books, it should also be moved to the "Bankruptcy" side.

Thank you!!

I came back the 5th of this month because of what is going on.  I was planning on staying out till Dec. but I figured I better get in here and get my resume updated.  
The baby is doing great, thanks for asking.
I was just bugging like always.

If we can set up new ones for NETCO, I do not see why we need the old ones.

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

If the central books have 2 set up then I'll leave MC assigned to GD and we need another set of central books set up for P/B/I.  Please have the new books set up in Global first (with new book codes, not MC) then email me the new IDs, book names, book codes and region codes.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 24. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

did this change recently?  I have done several....3-5 transactions without a
problem.  I understood the verification only mattered if I ever transacted
an agregate of $1000.  I will double check that, but you should not have a
problem getting the funds.

FYI - not sure if you know this yet, but you need to become verified on
PayPal before your payment can go through.  This usually entails you getting
the two amounts from your bank account that they drafted - usually pennies.
Once you are verified, I will receive the funds and I will mail out the
cube.  Thanks.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Dianne,

Hope you are ready for the rapidly approaching holidays!

Need to share new opportunities with you in the event you know of
individuals who might be interested.  I will of course, be reviewing
existing resumes for possible candidates, but need to make you aware of
other opening that have just become available.

We had two resignations last week opening up the need to recruit for the
2 following positions:

            Vice President of Clinical Operations - Requires someone
with a rather specialized background on the clinical side.
            Director of Business Operations - Works with start-up's and
existing centers implementing and problem solving within the business
office.

Projected growth has created the need for:

            Development Coordinator - Coordinates and works with all
phases of a new center to bring it from inception to opening.

All three of these positions will be based in Kansas City.

And of course, we are still actively recruiting for an Administrator and
Group Vice President for the Texas market.

Have a wonderful holiday!!  And as always, thanks for your efforts on
our behalf.

Best Wishes,

Judy Byers
Director Human Resources
ASC Group

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

Hi!

Here are the variances between the Risk P&L and the GL as of October 31 for the books that I handle.  As you could probably guess, we would like to have as many variances cleared by the end of the year, so please call me if you have any questions.  Also, please let me know if the book admins listed are incorrect.

Thanks,
Amanda

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

I actually have the time to have a life.  I never knew there was such a thing.  I've been reading about all the events going on down there, and have been thinking about all my friends that are effected.  
Just came back from Canada last week.  Went on a skiing trip to Whistler, outside of Vancouver.  I t is one of the best resorts in North America.  Tommorow I'm going to LA for a convention and then I'm off to Europe to see my sister and her new baby, whenever it decides to be born.  So all in all, things are great.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

That is funny.  I just ordered some more to sell on EBay, I can buy four
sleeves for $16.50 and they are going for $40 a sleeve on EBay.  You might
want to sell them.  We were actually a skit last week on Saturday Night
Live.  Pretty funny stuff.  Keep working on your wife about Jazz Fest.  Ash
is working her too.

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - =
Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/26/01 Brookins is expected to miss the rest =
of the season with a broken foot. Moe Williams will probably become Baltimo=
re's No. 1 RB now, and the Ravens may add another RB to their roster in the=
 next few days.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/26/01 Bar=
low dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not b=
een determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/0=
1 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is d=
ay to day.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/01 Jackson=
 re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day=
.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - The Executioners Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is li=
sted as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken=
 for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's W=
eek 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/2=
6/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched=
 at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mi=
tchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the B=
engals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 8=
0 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in=
 recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opp=
onents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kil=
l Cult Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught fiv=
e passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack rem=
ains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL -=
 North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01  The Jaguars held Ismail to three =
catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail rem=
ains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most comple=
te and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Not So N=
ice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Ja=
cksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erra=
tic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - =
Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the bal! l ! six times f=
or 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during th=
e remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Executioners Updated=
 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught =
five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners =
would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian To=
mlinson , RB SD - The Executioners Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out =
of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The roo=
kie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego=
's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Fl=
utie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Ar=
izona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advanta=
ge.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I did it again Updated 11/25/01 Plummer=
 had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown again! st=
! San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy q=
uarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/2=
5/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards=
 and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy r=
eceivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie J=
ackson , WR NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outin=
g against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. =
He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth startin=
g in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 11/25/01 Ho=
rn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New =
England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth =
starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Update=
d 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball ! fi=
! ve times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage=
 packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy=
 team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able=
 to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - T=
he Guzzlers Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two t=
ouchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a prett=
y good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - The Execu=
tioners Updated 11/25/01  Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po=
sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable =
Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa=
triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Executioners Up=
dated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions a=
gainst the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look=
 like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - N=
orth Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 Sanders! l! eft Sunday's game agains=
t San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by Mar=
Tay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Who's =
Yo Daddy Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, ca=
tching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a f=
umble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disa=
ppointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best =
outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309=
 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fant=
asy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oron=
de Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eigh=
t passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and =
lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in=
 these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 1=
1/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yar! ds! , three TDs and no interceptions at =
Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fie=
dler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNa=
bb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McN=
abb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions.=
 Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performanc=
e.  James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught=
 four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be =
a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner ,=
 WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes f=
or only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the =
past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.  =

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 25. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks

Howdy everyone!

Rebecca, myself and the pumpkin will be gracing the Great State of Texas in
late Feb.  During this time, we will be hosting a post wedding reception on
Sunday the 24th. of February, 2002 at the Coliseum Restaurant in Clear Lake.
  We plan on starting the party at around 1300.  It will be a semi formal
type of occasion, so just bring an appetite and get ready for a great
afternoon!

If you could please let us know via email if you can make it and if you will
be bringing a significant other, we would greatly appreciate it.

We look forward to seeing everyone there!

Tommy
GO STELLERS!!!!!!

Kam,

Per your conversation with Sharon this morning, please find below the email
that we sent yesterday in regards to our gas stub period testing.

We would like to begin the preliminary stages of our second phase of stub
period testing as part of our Natural Gas Audit.  In order for us to do so,
we will need your assistance in obtaining all transactions entered into
from October 1, 2001 through and including November 30, 2001 from both TAGG
and Sitara.  Since we are selecting the deals we would like to test
statistically, we will also need to ensure that deals entered into both
Sitara and TAGG are included only once in our population.  In addition, we
will be requesting all transactions entered into during December 2001 from
both TAGG and Sitara at the end of the year.

In relation to our first phase of stub period testing, we are in the
process of assessing and testing the documentation provided thus far and
will be sending an additional request later this week.

Thanks for all your help.  If you have any questions, please call me at
X6-6269.

Jennifer

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks 
Darla Saucier

This is someone Diane knows and have recently  reinitiated contact.
 
Diane needs to know what he does and  responsibilities before a face-to-face... If he is an 
officer and ANICO is suing all players in sight,  she needs to know..
 
We checked Edgar for him and he didn't come up in  any of the filings.
 
Let Diane know at her work email or by  phone.
 
Thanks.
 
Diane and George

I started calculating the bankruptcy book last night for the credit group.  This needs to be done nightly.  I may be out a few days so if I am can someone else take this over from me please?  We can also use these to check daily for counterparties that have been moved incorrectly.

The file is in O:\erms\1intra\west\Bankruptcy post-ids.xls

Thanks

It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Thank you.

Subject:	What Enron Did Right

A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.

Manager's Journal:
What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the
vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),
competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and
dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being
an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from
grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.

   Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron
became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor
of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles
drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements
were all a mirage.
   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under
investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts
of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the
law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve
themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an
enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.


   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and
electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open
market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to
enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.

   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,
and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have
been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough
deregulation.


   -- Innovation and the "de-integration" of power contracts. Under the
old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were
offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system
was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you
can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that
could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.

   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its
constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,
and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's
investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by
inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph
Schumpeter called the "process of Creative Destruction." But creative
destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be
part of Enron's problem today.


   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended
the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper
company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper
plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run
all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.
Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with
inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of
"customers" and "suppliers." Enron envisioned creating free markets for
components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market
terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The
development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions
of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the
economy.


   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated
environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a
single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could
be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to
the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of
alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling
switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules
or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,
and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This
policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value
for both customers and suppliers.


   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could
easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of
the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal
controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we
judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of
Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion
each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on
company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.

   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading
losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's
ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and
trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,
counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the
erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.


   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's
corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood
stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,
slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline
company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron
became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It
bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to
start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.

   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and
an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization
and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe
the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.
This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could
serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.

   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the
transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet
corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in
almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.

   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to
find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all
should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to
reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

Dear all-

Could you all please review the attached list and see if these are any of your books (or if you know anything about them)?  If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.  Please let me know either way if any of these are your books so that I won't harass you anymore!  I need a response ASAP.

I appreciate your help!  Thanks,

Christy

We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

  November 23, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

I'm in the new building as well.  We were on of the first groups to move in back Oct.  I'm on 4.
My group is definitely out the door.  Credit Trading is the name of my group and I think the name speaks for

   George W. Bush and Bill Clinton somehow ended up at the same barbershop.
 As they sat there, each being worked on by a different barber, not a word
 was spoken. The barbers were both afraid to start a conversation, for fear
 it would turn  to politics.

    As the barbers finished their shaves, the one who had Clinton in his
 chair reached for the aftershave. Clinton was quick to stop him saying, "No
 thanks, my wife Hillary will smell that and think I've been in a
 whorehouse."

 The second barber turned to Bush and said, "How about you?" Bush replied,
 "Go ahead. My wife Laura doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse
 smells like."

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Thanks

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call 

Russ

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

Thanks,

still working.  I hope to have it completed before the week is out.  As I am sure you are experiencing as well all the fire drills that are currently going on around here, I have been running since I got back from vacation.  Believe me when I say this is a high priority for me as well because of all the potential P&L fallout for the traders who have been entering this information.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.  I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.  Thanks.

Subject:        RE: NICOR 

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks 
Darla Saucier

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...

If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunch a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, you have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your printer.

 Daddy Updated 12/25/01 Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. Howev=
er, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher =
said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   Jam=
es Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a spr=
ained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont=
 Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleelan=
d , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendo=
n on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , =
RB GB - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the f=
ourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   T=
odd Bouman , QB MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start=
 Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was re=
placed by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake Pit Updated 12/=
23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but =
he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gr=
amatica  , K TB - One Man Show Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamst=
ring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but=
 Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Me=
ximullets Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's ga=
me. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with so=
me pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - oops, I did it again Updated =
12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the de=
ath of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graha=
m doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will =
be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No=
. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antow=
ain Smith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career=
-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runne=
rs in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McN=
air  , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Satur=
day despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a=
 touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jef=
f Garcia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice tim=
e was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards t=
hat he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't gr=
eatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remain=
ing weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , R=
B TEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game =
despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter becaus=
e of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thr=
ill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game agai=
nst the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in h=
is absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley bro=
ke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regula=
r season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once =
again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player =
during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Who's =
Yo Daddy Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically =
in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald =
Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the f=
orefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn=
't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks =
15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Co=
nsider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons=
 to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need a=
n emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/21/01 Wa=
rner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect=
 fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Exe=
cutioners Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this yea=
r. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched=
.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slo=
w this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesit=
ate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - North Bl=
vd Nutwhackers Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy own=
ers this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. =
  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has=
 been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2=
 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine =
Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you=
 play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richard=
son , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consiste=
nt scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   T=
ony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Executioners Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't pl=
ayed as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench duri=
ng the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Fat Bastards Updated 1=
2/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to hel=
p lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Meximullets Updat=
ed 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a ri=
sky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Not So =
Nice Machine Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for hi=
m to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  More Updates  [IM=

Bernice - please set up the attached book request and notify when complete.

Francis/Cecilia - I will be out of the office Thursday and Friday (Dec 20 and 21).  Please handle the Erms side once Bernice sends out the notification.

I have already set up these books in RisktRAC.

Due to the Outlook problems, I was unable to handle this request in a timely fashion.  Sorry for any delays this may have caused.

Thanks everyone and have a happy and safe holiday!

I know we have moved this meeting already, but since I have very little info ( only what I read on Yahoo!)
I think we should wait till next week to meet.  So I am going to cancel.

I have given Leslie, Jeff , Stacey and Rita,  Enron BUCKS cards.  Make them buy you a drink.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Thanks for you patients and continued understanding.

Please let me know if a representative from the Risk Management group will be able to meet with the development team today from 10 to 11am in ECS 05055.  Below is a description of the meeting contained in the invite.



Invite Note:  We are beginning the development stage of our Consolidated Gas System - Reporting project and we need to get more detailed information about the location of data that is being pulled in WeaponX presently.  The majority of the reports we have been able to locate in ERMS but there are a couple where the data has not been found.  We need to map the present location of the data to ensure all information will be in the new system.  We would also like to go through a calc (step-by-step) to ensure all necessary pieces will be included in the new system.

We are requesting one representative from Risk Management be present to answer a few questions.  A data architect and a developer will be present to ask necessary questions to get off to a good start.  Please let me know who will be available from the Risk side.

Thank you.

We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.

Victor,
	We have three deals (sales) to Kaztex for Ocotber 2001 production that Kaztex says aren't theirs.  Deals 715257, 715271, and 715294.  Kaztex says they belong to Nicor, and not Kaztex.  We contacted Nicor, and they also said they did not buy this gas from us.  Can you please clarify who should be paying for this gas?  The total $ amount for all three deals is $329,630.44, so I really need to find out who should be paying for this as soon as possible.  Thank you.

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Thanks

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Phillip,
Last week we discussed me spending time with you one morning to see exactly what it is that I will be doing.  I imagine it will be more of an observing lesson than anything else, but I would like to stop by Thursday morning.  If you are available, what time should I come down there?

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Dear You Love,

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel:

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft.

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight.

SECURITY FEE
The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket. This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002. It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.

Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority. Be sure to stay informed with continental.com at:
http://continentalairlines.rsc01.net/servlet/cc4?JHEVCU*ishOLQLJmELgkhgEJht*z*UA
before leaving for the airport. We're looking forward to welcoming you onboard!

Sincerely,
Mark F. Bergsrud
Vice President, Marketing
Continental Airlines, Inc.

Kam ok the only easy way to do this is I'm gonna put each one of you on a spreadsheet, Sheet 1 , 2 and 3 and put what you guys are approving then I expect the same spreadsheet back  with who will be alternate and primary approvers. This will be very tediuos cause there are sooo many items out there. So we will definatley need all of you to help with this transistion. I will work on the spreasheet now. Anne Bike no longer has any rights to approve. I gave you all the rights so on spreadsheet you will see her stuff on your sheet. 

Thanks,
Erica Garcia

Erica,

I need to make some changes to the list of e-request approvers.  

Anne Bike has left the group and I will be taking over all her requests.  Anything related to sitara and TDS for the west desk will now be my responsibility. 
Phillip Love should now be the approver for all TDS and sitara requests related to the EAST and VNG regions.
Scott Palmer will be responsible for TDS and sitara for Wellhead, Central and Chicago regions.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=

Are there any other files/directories that the estate people in risk will need to use to do their jobs.  IT will have to go into each macro and change the database that it is using to the new one they are creating this weekend.  I don't know if any of you are still using any exotic spreadsheets other than the transport model.  Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing.  (curve files)

Here are the files that use ERMS that the estate will be using.

O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\Benchmark\2002\Jan-02
O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\2002\0102\regions

I can get the Titleist Enron for $45 per dozen..
I will pay $40 per dozen for your pinnacle. Prices are
going to drop fast on these so time is very important.

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 15. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending.

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks 
Darla Saucier

Dear all-

Could you all please review the attached list and see if these are any of your books (or if you know anything about them)?  If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.  Please let me know either way if any of these are your books so that I won't harass you anymore!  I need a response ASAP.

I appreciate your help!  Thanks,

Christy

Now that Sitara is systematically adding new locations to the attached swaps, do you still want to receive the email

       The Sad State of Our Military


I sat, as millions of other Americans and watched
as our government underwent a peaceful transition
of power January 2001.

At first, I felt a swell of pride and patriotism as

I watched George W. Bush take his oath of office.

However, all that pride vanished as I watched
William Jefferson Clinton board Air Force One
for the final time.

I saw 21 US Marines in full dress, with rifles, fire
a 21 gun salute to the outgoing president.

It was then that I realized how far America's
military deteriorated. Every last one of them
missed!!!!!!

Phillip,

Below is the information for the CGAS book that was killed on 12/13/01.  This book should have liquidated in December.  Can we get this deal back?

Thanks,

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 7. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

Subject:	more terminated deals to move

Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and I have been working from a report provided by Russell Diamond that lists "live" deals for counterparties and our current exposure.  Based on that list, here are some deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books.  There will be many more deals listed to move on Tuesday.  Please note that deals for many of the counterparties listed on Russell's report have already been moved into the bankruptcy books due to auto-termination.

Once we finish looking at the "live" counterparties, we will continue providing deal information for new contracts that are added to the Master Log report compiled by Legal.  I will be adding the deals from Cyndie's sheets on Tuesday.  I have 8 more counterparties to review from Russell's report and that information will be provided on Tuesday as well.

Please call if you have any questions.  

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 9. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warre=
n in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE=

unday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB =

Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he lef=
t the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatic=
a  , K TB - One Man Show Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring i=
n the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Grama=
tica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Meximull=
ets Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He=
 should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pai=
n in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - oops, I did it again Updated 12/23/=
01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of=
 his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham does=
n't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be sig=
ned off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 re=
ceiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Sm=
ith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high =
156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in =
the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair  ,=
 QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday de=
spite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touch=
down pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garc=
ia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was =
limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he=
 has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly =
affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining we=
eks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN =
- Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despit=
e suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a=
 neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Ki=
ll Cult Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against th=
e Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his abs=
ence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his=
 right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular seas=
on.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again =
performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during=
 the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Who's Yo Dad=
dy Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in rec=
ent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes =
, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefro=
nt this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't ver=
y explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 thr=
ough 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 12/21/01 Consider=
 Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to po=
st better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emer=
gency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/21/01 Warner s=
hould guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine =
numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Execution=
ers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He =
will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Ra=
ndy Moss , WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this=
 season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to=
 start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - North Blvd Nut=
whackers Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners th=
is year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Mich=
ael Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been =
inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at be=
st during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine Update=
d 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play =
in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , =
RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent sco=
ring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Go=

   Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Michael Pittm=
an , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/29/01 Pittman suffered a concussion in=
 Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to day.  James Stewart =
, RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 10/29/01 Stewart was inactive for Sunday's=
 game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at RB for the Lions.  Keys=
hawn Johnson, WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01Johnson sat out the sec=
ond half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of=
 a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playi=
ng with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will ge=
t an MRI in the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they =
are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probabl=
y could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."  E=
mmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced hims=
elf OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3=
 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, bu=
t I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't =
know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able =
to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next w=
eek at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluat=
ed on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    =
 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 According to pu=
blished reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against =
Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action. Eddie Kennison , WR =
DEN - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards a=
gainst New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has rever=
ted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mi=
ke Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for on=
ly 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-ya=
rd run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yar=
ds also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.=
 David Patten , WR NE - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five p=
asses for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring t=
hreat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy B=
rown , WR NE - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86=
 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. =
Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams o=
n the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 1=
0/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the pas=
t, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie =
and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a F=
antasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Jone=
s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passe=
s for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones =
may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to p=
refer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red=
 zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Centers was =
limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills id=
eally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, s=
o don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR B=
UF - ! Th! e Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 y=
ards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears t=
o have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasse=
lbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game a=
s a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he conti=
nued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downf=
ield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Nice Machine Updat=
ed 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consider=
ing the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked res=
pectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post g=
ood yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overa=
ll output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/28/01 Gad=
sden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is=
 not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James =
McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/! 28! /01 McKnight caught eight p=
asses for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami r=
eceiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , R=
B NYG - The Nice Machine Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards o=
n eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbe=
rs, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , =
WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 10=
9 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player=
, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Execution=
ers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was=
 held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but =
the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the =
ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 19=
0 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, ! no! w the =
erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce St=
aley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday agai=
nst Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with=
 two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush de=
fense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noti=
ng that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggest=
s that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky=
 starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 10! /2! 8/=
01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelph=
ia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back=
 while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Execu=
tioners Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns an=
d no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall c=
hallenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with bette=
r stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers =
Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday =
against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot =
for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was stil=
l a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should =
break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of=
 the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Pittm=
an rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much =
better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will=
 be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston =
, WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for =
108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an incons=
istent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy p=
layer because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's e=
asily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I =
did it again Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns a=
nd two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inc=
onsistent he can be. Unle! ss! the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn'=
t rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sund=
ay, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defen=
se has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup=
, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit wil=
l give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL =
- Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yard=
s, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 y=
ards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't gre=
at for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary=
. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  More Upd=

I can run the A/P for my side.  I don't know how much on the settlements side is all part of this issue since there are some true purchases and sales, I just don't want to give you figures that are not correct even though I know the majority of the balances belong to the cleanup.

I was under the impression that there was an outstanding A/R and A/P balance on this counterparty in the 4-5 million dollar range.  Should be pretty noticeable.

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Subject:        RE: NICOR 

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks

Per John Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.  That is why this deal was killed.  You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.  Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

I spoke with Sylvia Pollan this afternoon in regards to Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership (SHORTNAME: MIDLANDCOGEN). Although the counterparty terminated the 9/1/90 agreement 1/15/02 per the Master Letter Log, we should continue to moving the gas until further notice. As result of such, please move the following transactions from the BANKRUPTCY book back to the 'Live' side (sorry, couldn't think of a better description). I will send immediate notice should the status of these transactions change.

Erica,

I need to make some changes to the list of e-request approvers.  

Anne Bike has left the group and I will be taking over all her requests.  Anything related to sitara and TDS for the west desk will now be my responsibility. 
Phillip Love should now be the approver for all TDS and sitara requests related to the EAST and VNG regions.
Scott Palmer will be responsible for TDS and sitara for Wellhead, Central and Chicago regions.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks

Kam

Attached is a spreadsheet representing additional Counterparties who have terminated their relationship with ENA.  There aren't enough deals to involve IT, so can you please have your Risk groups move the attached deals to the Bankruptcy books.  

(There is a tab for Nat Gas and one for EIM (Paper))

Sherry -
As you can see from the attached, all but $109,630 of AIG's combined position is natural gas related. Give me a call if you have any other questions.
Have a great Thanksgiving.

MAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 12/=
29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing =
elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is e=
xpected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup=
 vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwha=
ckers Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a =
family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Clev=
eland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Upd=
ated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against C=
hicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy =
season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee=
) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to=
 start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR=
 CAR - Not So Nice Machine Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not pl=
ay this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely s=
tart in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01=
 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not star=
t on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his=
 playing time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Meximullets =
Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a =
thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN=
 - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Gr=
een Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in mo=
st of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start t=
his deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - The Executioners=
 Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are int=
erested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New En=
gland's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Pat=
riots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no dea=
ls would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , =
K TB - One Man Show Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out=
 for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Do=
ug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky =
Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 12/28/01 Dun=
n's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this wee=
k, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent=
 weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/28/01 Westb=
rook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this=
 week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may =
miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jac=
kson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR AT=
L - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee =
injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Age=
nt Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot ove=
r rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time no=
w that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets =
in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/28=
/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his =
hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Nort=
h Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thurs=
day. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy star=

C - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice=
 time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie=

n Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free=
 Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve.=
 O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is =
out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine Updated 12/28/01 Brook=
ins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may no=
t see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit=
 Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury=
. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming =
his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/=
28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to pl=
ay this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake Pit Updated 12/28/01 Wall=

A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Da=

back.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is d=

avis , RB WAS - The Executioners Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned=
 to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - M=
eximullets Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't app=
ear to meet coach Dennis Green's "full strength" criteria for starting agai=
nst Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches did=
n't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate =
in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without full=
y suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters=
 were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wy=

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined=

today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day=

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 30. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

 coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will s=
tart in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. Th=
e Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to com=
plications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Upd=
ated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Satu=
rday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry yo=

 Executioners Player News  Peter Warrick , Active WR Updated 12/26/01 Warri=
ck, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has =
been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at t=
his point of the postseason.   Rich Gannon , Active QB Updated 12/21/01 Gan=
non has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on =
many title teams, and should never be benched.   Tony Gonzalez , Active TE =
Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Stil=
l, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Marty Booker =
, Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Booker has been one of the better receivers in=
 the NFC. Look for him to produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. =
  Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 12/21/01 According to the Pro Football =
News and Injury Report, Davis' status for Sunday's game is questionable rig=
ht now. He has told reporters he will play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start i=
n his place if Davis can't play.   Albert Connell , Reserve WR Updated 12/1=
7/01 Connell will be officially suspended for the remainder of the season b=
y the team, league sources told SportsLine.com. Connell was a major disappo=
intment for Fantasy leaguers this year.   Cris Carter , Active WR Updated 1=
2/16/01 The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the vete=
ran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during =
any week of the Fantasy playoffs.   Tiki Barber , Reserve RB Updated 12/16/=
01 Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out=
 of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' o=
ffense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy p=
layoffs.   Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01 Brady had another disapp=
ointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo=
. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to be a Fantasy risk during t=
he most important weeks of the year.  LaDainian Tomlinson , Active RB Updat=
ed 12/16/01 Tomlinson had only 69 all-purpose yards on Saturday against Oak=
land. He seems to be wearing down somewhat, which makes him more and more o=
f a risk for Fantasy owners.   Shawn Jefferson , Reserve WR Updated 12/14/0=
1 Jefferson (back) has returned to practice. He is now listed as probable f=
or Sunday's game, but Brian Finneran has started to take some of his reps a=
s the team's No. 3 receiver.  Roland Williams , Reserve TE Updated 12/13/01=
 Williams is day to day with knee and ankle injuries. He is expected to pla=
y on Saturday.  Jets , Active DT Updated 12/03/01 CB Aaron Glenn may miss u=
p to four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right kne=
e. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more often to protect the secon=
dary, but the unit may also allow more passing yards in the next few games.=
  Drew Bledsoe , Reserve QB Updated 11/14/01 Bledsoe has been cleared to pl=
ay, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try and=
 prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't a=
ppear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 app=
ears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold onto the job =
past the Rams game.  Trung Canidate , Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01 Canidate =
got almost all of the carries in the second half of Sunday's game against C=
arolina. With St. Louis way ahead, coach Mike Martz obviously rested stud b=
ack Marshall Faulk, who had 183 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the fir=
st half. Canidate finished the game with 145 yards rushing and a touchdown.=
 However, don't expect Canidate to get as much playing time in games where =
the score isn't so one-sided.   Adam Vinatieri , Active K Updated 12/13/00 =
Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent=
 weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get =

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Russ

r this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richard=
son has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a ch=
ance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should m=
ove the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touch=
down-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes =
, RB KC - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many pla=
ys to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes rol=
l up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your act=
ive lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Gree=
n , ! QB! KC - Meximullets Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped ba=
dly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expec=
t him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't r=
ush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander =
, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Al=
exander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia.=
 He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting h=
im is somewhat of a gamble.   ! Kyle Brady  , TE JAC - One Man Show Updated=
 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We do=
n't recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely t=
his is the game he will break his slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Not So Nic=
e Machine Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive =
weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll fac=
e a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a=
 Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - One Man Sh! ow! Updated=
 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against B=
altimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn startin=
g at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat=
 Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for ex=
plosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/21=
/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you hav=
e to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have=
 less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more pa=
sses than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB JAC - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs de=
spite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend =
you use him this week if you have no other options at running back.  Marcus=
 Pollard , TE IND - The Guzzlers Updated 11/21/01 Pollard will have his han=
ds full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulters on Sunday. While P=
ollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks, you shou=
ldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should probably start him =
unle! ss! you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reg=
gie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes=
 thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we =
only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.  =
Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/01 Harrison is a mus=
t-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. However, he should ha=
ve no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great st=
ats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11=
/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should =
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats, =
but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - =
Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown !=
 hi! s way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key membe=
r of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys w=
ill likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start on=
e it should definitely be Clark.  Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - oops, I did it=
 again Updated 11/21/01 Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing gam=
e more Thursday against Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. Howeve=
r, he had no catches in similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys w=
ill be ready to defend short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thi=
n at the tight end position.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/=
21/01 If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will=
 need to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't re=
commend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a rel=
iable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.  Kevin Dyson , WR=
 TEN - Meximullets Updated 11/21/01 Don't look for good numbers from Dyson =
this week. he has been inconsistent this season, and may not do much agains=
t a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Derrick Mason!  , WR TEN - The Lie Downs =
Updated 11/21/01 Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steel=
ers. Don't expect him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.  Mike Al=
stott , RB TB - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/01 Alstott is once again pla=
ying second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't expect huge Fantasy numbers fr=
om him. Unless you play in a deeper, scoring-based league, starting Alstott=
 is a risk.   Brad Johnson , QB TB - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/01 Johnson=
 threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no touchd=
owns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy standpoi=
nt, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor.   Keyshawn Johns=
on , WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/01 Johnson had a big game against =
Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for 89 yards. He was held out of t=
he end zone again, but look for that to change on Monday night against St. =
Louis.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/01 Hakim =
suffered an ! an! kle injury during last Sunday's game against New England.=
 He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay, so avoid =
starting him if at all possible.   Torry Holt , WR STL - One Man Show Updat=
ed 11/21/01 Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last wee=
kend against New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the l=
eague, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Th=
e Guzzlers Updated 11/21/01 Bruce had a huge game against New England last =
weekend, posting seven catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid =
game in Week 11 against a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big p=
lay.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - oops, I did it again Updated 11/21/01 Gary w=
ill likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but we don=
't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will probably fo=
cus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky starts this w=
eek since they have been splitting time.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - Not So Ni=
ce Machine Updated 11/2! 1/! 01 With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidel=
ined by injury, Griese will have questionable receivers to work with Thursd=
ay against Dallas. However, the Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the=
 run and force Griese to beat them through the air. He should provide your =
team with decent stats and is worth using this week.  Marshall Faulk , RB S=
TL - oops, I did it again Updated 11/21/01 Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards an=
d a touchdown against New England last weekend. He's the best player in Fan=
tasy Football, and is a must-start in any league format.   Mo! re! Updates =

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Ev,

I sent something to you about a week and a half ago, and I just got it
back as bounced.  I've included Phil so that if I have the address
wrong, he can get it to you.  Sorry.

Anyway,  Congrats on the new rat.  What else have you been up to?

As for me, I've got 2 of my own.  Son, Reece, is 3 1/2 and Daughter,
Zoe, is almost 5 mos old (damn, it seems like she was born just
yesterday).  I have some pics online @ www.cyberblanca.com/kids when you
have time.

I hope this makes it to you this time.  Hope you all have a wonderful
Christmas.

Either the location, or the number of locations has changed on revision number 56. The hedge associated with this deal needs to be re-evaluated.

Subject: FW:  Terrorists
Subject: Ollie  North
You know, it's funny. I remember very vividly the Oliver North  hearings, but did not recall the name of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist that  North was threatened by. Has this slimeball been around that long?. It's pretty  evident, in hindsight that we should have listened to Ollie!
I was at a  UNC lecture the other day where they played a video of Oliver North testifying  at theIran-Contra hearings during the Reagan administration.
There was  Colonel North in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But what he  said a stunner. He was being grilled by some senator who asked him: "Did you not  recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?"  Oliver  replied, "Yes I did sir."
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh  out of the audience, "Isn't this just a little excessive?" 
"No sir,"  continued Oliver.  
"No. And why not?"
"Because the lives of  my family and I were threatened."
"Threatened? By who."
"By a  terrorist, sir."
"Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that  much?"
"His name is Osama bin Laden."
At this point the senator  tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then  probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator  continued. "Why are you so afraid of this man?"
"Because sir, he is the  most evil person alive that I know of."
"And what do you recommend we do  about him?"
"If it were up to me, I'd recommend an assassin team be  formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth."
The  senator disagreed with this approach and that was all they showed of the  clip.
It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of  Osama bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess  like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like the  virus they truly are.

   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 12/23/01 McNair p=

ractice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted a=

uring Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated=
 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks=
 the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option i=
f you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated=
 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the play=
offs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB O=
AK - The Executioners Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy=

  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is havin=

ayoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 12/21/01 Harrison=
 will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL seas=
on. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the pl=

Subject:  Enron





I bit off topic of list, but .......

In case you were wondering how Enron came into so much trouble, here is an
explanation reputedly given by an Ag Eco professor at Texas A&M, to explain
it in terms his students could understand.

CAPITALISM:
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies and you hire cowhands to help out on the ranch. You
sell cattle.
The economy grows and eventually you can pass the business on and your
cowhands can retire on the profits.

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM:
You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company,
using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then
execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get
all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.
The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a
Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells
the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
more.
Now do you see why a company with $62 billion in assets is declaring
bankruptcy?

EA - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to mi=
ss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of man=
y contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should r=
oll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE -=
 The Executioners Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for n=
ow, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any chan=
ge! s ! this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy sta=
rter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if yo=
u can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may hav=
e to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's=
 status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - North=
 Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently h=
ealed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expect=
ed to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will c=
ontinue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason come=
s into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 Mike =
Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving=
 Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he sa=
id. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within =
this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the nex=
t win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy =
most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 B=
ruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. H=
is loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is =
widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Whe=
atley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Cos=
ta Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to pla=
y on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11! /2! 0/01 Kinne=
y (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to r=
eturn to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd Nut=
whackers Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this w=
eek. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blv=
d Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore w=
hen he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now s=
ays he doesn't expect him to miss any pr! ac! tice time this week.   Derric=

returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minn=

ed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his pla=
ce,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Meximullets Up! da! ted 11/20/01  Wayne has a =
sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orlea=
ns. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IN=
D - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He=
 will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meani=
ng Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.  =
 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told th=
e Miami Herald there is no ! QB! controversy surrounding Fielder and backup=
 Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the star=
ter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play tur=
nover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - oops, I did it again Updated 1=
1/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suffic=
iently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a =
chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver =
Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation=
 where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then =
we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't =
indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him i=
nvolved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , W=
R WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last=
 weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. Ho=
wever, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this poin=
t.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks=
, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered =
a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects=
 of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green ,=
 WR TB - The Guzzlers Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to retur=
n to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this se=
ason, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR =
SF - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and a=
nkle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. T=
he injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be=
 in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - O=
ne Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sund=
ay's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expecte=
d to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real val=
ue as a Fantasy pla! ye! r, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley.    Gia=
nts , DT NYG - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 According to the New=
 York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began =
giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure t=
hat he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night,=
 but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should c=
onsider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   El=
vis Grbac , QB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 ! The Baltimore Sun =
says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's start=
ing QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy t=
eams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still =
dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game agains=
t Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at thi=
s point.    Ravens , DT BAL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end =
Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee ! su=
! rgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore def=
ense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    C=
owboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, wh=
o was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get th=
e start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denv=
er's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' d=
efense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake =
Pit Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Den=
ver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told=
 the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due =
to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. =
    Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bru=
ised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some prac=
tice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta=
. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could t=
urn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after =
missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to p=
lay on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Co=

I told you the wrong dates...it's the 8th and 16th instead of the the 1st and the 8th.

Let me know if you hear anything else about this.

All,

The last information I had on Benefits was that Enron benefits would cease on Feb. 8 and UBS benefits would start on Feb. 16.

Obviously, there is a gap here, and UBS/Enron are working to put something in place to cover this period.

If you have anything elective, you might find that it would be simpler if you were to avoid this gap period.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

I've been following the story in the paper since last week.  If you look
real close at the story though, you'll see that all these national
offensive leads were for small schools (NAIA, Division 1AA, etc.).  But,
still good news.  I forget the name of the Jaquars quarterback, but he
has nothing but praise for Petrino.

Now, if we can just get a defensive coordinator.  Wouldn't hurt to have
some defensive players too.

Things are okay here.  Kind of cold.  Ready for spring.

Saw this morning we hired Petrino.  I did not realize how successful he
has been at the college level.  Three times his offenses have led the
nation in offense.  He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.  He has
three playing in the NFL now that he developed.  I think this might be a
real good move.  How are things there?

Phillip,

I apologize that it has taken me so long to send you an e-mail like you asked us to, but I just wanted to send some suggestions/thoughts about things on the East Desk.

1.  I really like the idea of weekly meetings.  Especially in the new building where we will be spaced out and not all sitting together, I think it would be good for team unity.  Even if the meeting is only 10 minutes long, it gives the group a chance to talk about what everyone is working on and projects that we can work with others on.  Also, with people joining East and leaving East, the meetings could give us a chance to get to know each other better.  I realize that meetings are not necessary every week, but 2 or 3 a month have very helpful and beneficial for me.

2.  We were all going to give a small "lesson" on an area of our jobs that we have a strong knowledge about and present it to the others in our group.  Jeff has already given a lesson on NX3 Basis positions.  Although the lessons may be a little nerve wracking, I think they would be very useful to continue.  For example, the subjects of Liquidation, Storage, and OA are all areas I would like to know more about.

That's it really.  Thank you for all of your help so far with the Gulf4/5 "merger".  I am really excited about our new group and I can't wait to move to the new building.

Thanks,
Melissa

If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunch a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, you have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your printer. Thanks.

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call 

Russ

OK here is the spreadsheet. Please look at Sheet Kam and Sheet Phillip. On each sheet just put the names of primary and alternative approvers it doesn't matter is it is in your sheet or Philip's sheet. 

Thanks for your help,

Erica,

I need to make some changes to the list of e-request approvers.  

Anne Bike has left the group and I will be taking over all her requests.  Anything related to sitara and TDS for the west desk will now be my responsibility. 
Phillip Love should now be the approver for all TDS and sitara requests related to the EAST and VNG regions.
Scott Palmer will be responsible for TDS and sitara for Wellhead, Central and Chicago regions.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks

Kam

The Raiders have always been my team. The Chargers are my Home team.
I will ask about the Vegas weekend.

What????  I thought that was your team?  I am a big raiders fan and I hope
Chucky gets that ring this year.  Hey, FYI, we are getting a guys trip to
Las Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness if you are interested -
March 13-16th.  Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the
three nights.  I figure air fare is pretty cheap from SD, let me know if
you are interested.  Take care.

I started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara.  I don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either.  We should have everything clean to report it on Monday.

Going forward I guess we need to show people how to check it correctly.

See you on Monday.

Kam

Alejandra gave me a 5 min. crashcourse through the four calc sheets she updates at the end of the month.  I know that Kam knows about them so I'll just check with her but Alejandra also recommended splitting up these four sheets among everyone else to lighten the load...just a thought for next month.  Also, after training Michelle on Gd-Central and Gulf I definitely feel (hopefully not a false sense) ahead of the curve about the things i've learned...a compliment to your work also.
