Your passwords are extended, or if you did not have  one before (Rogers and 
Russell), you now do. Normally, Jeff Maack handles this,  but he's in our 
home office in Philadelphia today.

Rogers, we are launching TVA, ComEd and ERCOT  hourly, daily and term indexes 
March 19, and will begin beta testing on Feb. 19.  Feel free to let your 
colleagues  know.

Thanks for your interest. Let me know if I can  assist you in any way.

too many tardies and we'll keep you after school!

seriously, you're doing great, Don. Thanks for everything--including
TVA/ComEd indic & trades. We changed TVA methodology to include anything
sinking at the hub and moving through THAT SINKS IN SERC. Hope that works
for ya; let me know if not!!

you got any influence over the ERCOT guys? when the dust settles, we'd love
to get their trades & indic. I hear there's cuts and outages--could we get
yesterday's hourly from a check out guy or a scheduler, maybe, or Russell
B.?

Thanks--you da power man!

It was a pleasure talking with you yesterday evening. Thank you for making
the time to meet with us. I am looking forward to working with you on this
index. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Dear Don:

We are fine tuning the methodology for our hourly indexes in order to
clarify our regional definitions. I know that you offered some valuable
feedback in the past to Bobette Riner and wanted to solicit your input now
as well.

In the draft (attached) we have classified trades solely based on their
source and sink. In so doing, we have removed references to power moving
"into or through" hubs.

In drawing regional boundaries, we have generally relied on the NERC
regions, although we continue to offer two indexes for ECAR (AEP/Northern
ECAR and Cinergy/Southern ECAR). We also are retaining the Entergy/SPP
index, based on Entergy's  intention to join SPP's proposed Regional
Transmission Organization.


The most significant other changes are:

-- ComEd/MAIN: Trades sourcing from, or sinking in, Ameren's control area,
would be included; title may change to "MAIN"

-- TVA/SERC: Virginia would be included; as previously planned, the name
changes to "SERC"

-- ERCOT: power moving out of ERCOT can be included in the index

I will attempt to reach you via phone next week to discuss these proposed
changes. We are particularly interested in how these changes may impact use
of the indexes in financial trading, quantitative analysis, risk management,
deal structuring, etc.

Feel free to pass this along to any of your colleagues for their input and
to jot any immediate thoughts to me in an e-mail.

We appreciate your input.

Rika:

I enjoyed speaking with you today.

Attached is an example of our Cinergy hourly index and a chart listing the
start dates of all six hourly indexes.

Also attached is our current methodology (dated 3/01) and a draft
methodology incorporating changes we expect to institute shortly. The most
significant of these changes will make the Cinergy index more of a mirror of
the Into Cinergy next-day product. We have received some feedback from Enron
already on these changes but welcome additional comments.

I have asked Barbara Clancey of our customer service department to register
you, Don Baughman, Matt Lorenz and Juan Hernandez for access to our website
www.tradersnewsenergy.com She will send you an e-mail with your password and
logon information.

By separate e-mail, I will be sending you spreadsheets containing the
historical data. I will need our CTO, Greg Baber, to talk to you or your
technical contact to set up an FTP procedure to automate your receipt of the
indexes going forward.

Finally, Gene Simpson and I are set to meet you and the Enron team in your
office at 2 p.m. Monday Oct. 8. I will contact you next week to discuss the
agenda for our meeting and ensure that you have all the information you
need.

Feel free to contact me in the meantime with any questions.

TradersNews Energy has begun beta testing for its  three new hourly indexes, 
at TVA, ComEd and ERCOT. Attached are the first for  TVA and ComEd (ERCOT is 
sent on a separate list), although we have been  collecting historical data 
since Nov. 1, 2000.
?
We will distribute these two indexes to you at no  charge via e-mail during 
the beta testing period, which?concludes March 19.  On that date,?we will 
formally launch the indexes on our Web site,  at:? www.tradersnewsenergy.com. 
 

Your participation is vital to produce the most comprehensive and  accurate 
indexes. You may e-mail your prices and volumes to 
tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com,  or fax them to 713-647-7552. For your 
convenience, attached is an Excel file  you
can use to report your prices and volumes.

These three new indexes  join TradersNews' Cinergy, AEP and SPP/Entergy 
hourly indexes, launched in Fall  2000.  
NOTE: If you are using our Excel Upload feature,  hourly indexes for Feb. 16 
will be featured until 3:30?p.m. CST, today  only, because of yesterday's 
federal holiday. After 3:30 p.m. today, we will  feature those for Feb. 19.

?
If you are interested in receiving the ERCOT hourly  index during this month 
of testing,?e-mail Suzanna Strangmeier, at suzanna.strangmeier@ipgdirect.com, 
 or call her at 713/647-7325.

See you there!

I'm sorry for whatever is causing the difficulty for the night desk sending
us the hourly trades that day. I realize how frustrating it must be to take
the time to send it only to hear it did not show up for some reason.

Attached is a template, which includes 5 hubs: AEP, Cinergy, Entergy/SPP,
ComEd, and TVA. The last 2 are next on our list for expansion, and our plan
is to start them at some point during this first quarter. Please include any
hourly deals for these hubs, too, if you have any. The template can then be
emailed to tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com and a link to that email address
is in the template for your convenience.

Thank you again for all your time, and please let me know if there is
something I can do to help you all.

It's still a bit of a mystery. Our tech guy suggests that Doug try to send a
test email to tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com to see if an error message
comes back to him. I know he is probably not there now, but I hope things
work tonight when he sends.

Don:

In addition to the below, I'd like to mention another important update which
I inadvertently omitted.

TNE is actively expanding to Off-Peak markets and continues to provide high
quality service in the hourly market indices.  We have enhanced (expanding
via. overnight reporting team) and shifted our publishing time from
mid-morning to 6:00am allowing the hourly traders the "early bird-first
look".  The upside of these positive changes is obvious.

Again, I look forward to speaking with you the week of August 13th.

Don:

It was nice meeting you on the phone today.  I appreciate the time you
extended to me and
it was great to hear your interest in our power indexes/historical data as
applicable to your departmental needs.

As we discussed, I am pleased to mention, the growth and market penetration
of TNE is rapidly increasing.  In fact, over the last couple of weeks a
sampling of our contractual successes include:

A. Enron-specifically named license (3 users only) used for back office
accounting functions
    (note, this license is not for distribution and for WEB access and
indices only)
B  Top three (3) eastern power marketer serving over 43 million
homes/businesses
C. Top 10 energy company that handles approx. $250 billion in energy
transactions per year
   while producing 141.3 million physical MWh in 2000.

As mutually agreed upon, I will contact you the week of August 13th (upon my
return from business trips & vacation) to further discuss your requirements
in more detail.  We look forward to growing and expanding our relationship
with Enron and your department.  Thank you.

Mr. Baughman,

Thank you for your fax! Just wanted to verify the SPP information we have.
The information does not have the typical Bid (under price column) and Ask
(under volume column). For accuracy, could you confirm at your earliest
conveinence: what, if any, information is or is not indicitive? Thank you
sir!

Don,
I wanted to see if you would be available one day next week for a meeting to
discuss TraderNews and Enron. Tuesday or Wednesday at anytime that works for
you is great.  I would like to come over and see your trading floor if you
don't mind.
I also have a meeting Downtown on this Thursday afternoon, if you have a
time for a few drinks at Ninfas let me know.


Regards,
Jeff Maack

Thank you for attending our first users' meeting. We appreciate your
interest and commitment in building liquid, accurate hourly instruments that
will serve your companies' requirements. It is our mission to provide
accurate, unbiased indexes that include the greatest number of applicable
participants possible.

The attached hub definitions and methodology for the Cinergy hub -- a result
of dozens of interviews with market participants -- have been in place since
last September. As you're well aware, numerous traders have done index deals
and swaps off our hourly indexes.

If you want to trade off these indexes via instant messaging, please reply
with your instant messaging address, and whether you'd like to see us
develop a forum for such trading. You may also contact your favorite online
trading platform representatives re: offering hourly financial swaps.

TradersNews Energy today officially launched its new hourly indexes for
ERCOT, TVA/SERC and ComEd/MAIN. As a result, we will no longer be e-mailing
you the indexes you have been receiving during our free, pre-launch
examination.

To ensure you keep getting the benefit of these exclusive price discovery
and hedging tools, call TradersNews Energy Sales toll free at 1-888-TNE-1006
to learn how you can subscribe.

The three new indexes join our original hourly indexes (and our daily and
forward indexes) for Cinergy, AEP/Northern ECAR and Entergy/SPP.

 All TradersNews Indexes are available through direct feeds or via our
website at www.tradersnewsenergy.com

It was good speaking with you again today. As requested, here is another

if he is available) feedback next Wednesday.

Thanks for your attention,

Subject: Proposed revisions to TradersNews Hourly Index Methodology




Dear John:

We are fine tuning the methodology for our hourly indexes in order to
clarify our regional definitions. I know that you offered some valuable
feedback in the past to Bobette Riner and wanted to solicit your input now
as well.

In the draft (attached) we have classified trades solely based on their
source and sink. In so doing, we have removed references to power moving
"into or through" hubs.

In drawing regional boundaries, we have generally relied on the NERC
regions, although we continue to offer two indexes for ECAR (AEP/Northern
ECAR and Cinergy/Southern ECAR). We also are retaining the Entergy/SPP
index, based on Entergy's  intention to join SPP's proposed Regional
Transmission Organization.


The most significant other changes are:

-- ComEd/MAIN: Trades sourcing from, or sinking in, Ameren's control area,
would be included; title may change to "MAIN"

-- TVA/SERC: Virginia would be included; as previously planned, the name
changes to "SERC"

-- ERCOT: power moving out of ERCOT can be included in the index

I will attempt to reach you via phone next week to discuss these proposed
changes. We are particularly interested in how these changes may impact use
of the indexes in financial trading, quantitative analysis, risk management,
deal structuring, etc.

Feel free to pass this along to any of your colleagues for their input and
to jot any immediate thoughts to me in an e-mail.

We appreciate your input.

Hi, Don--

I forwarded your request to Jeff Maack, at 713/647-8802, and he'll work with
you pronto.

Next order of business: I understand we're getting together for a Happy Hour
soon? We look forward to it. What day next week is good for y'all, or shall
I check with J.D. or Rudy about it?

Thanks!

Don,
Thanks for your time yesterday, I will be putting together a press kit that
we can hand out to the different departments at
Enron.  Whenever you get the chance if you could send over the names and
titles of the different departments it would really help.  I will be back in
contact with you and lets try to set up next Wed. for some drinks after
work.  Have a great time in Vegas and Good Luck.  Tell hair guy hello.

Regards,
Jeff

I sent your message to our tech department to see if they can figure out if
there is a problem on our end. It looks like Doug emailed it to the correct
address so I can't imagine what the problem could be. Thanks for forwarding
us that.

Dinner last week was cancelled because Jeff wants to be there when we do get
together and he was busy last week. Rudy and Bobette have talked about
meeting for drinks sometime soon. Hope you can join us when we do meet.

Don,
I got a call from another Hourly Trading floor that uses Enron online and is
looking to do some hourly deals at Cinergy.
He said he has not seen anything for over a month.  Do you think you guys
will put the TNE numbers back up, or if they are where should he be looking.

How was Vegas?

Regards,
Jeff

I wasn't sure if we needed to send out the report since it was a half holiday 
for most companies, so i opted not to. I didn't send one Monday since it was 
a nerc holiday.  Hopefully she won't call and give you shit about it. Plus we 
didnt have prices in so your guess is much better than mine as to what 
actually happened.
Thanks
Chad

Thanks, Don, I know you are having a rough morning. I know TVA and Ercot
have been gathered over the phone.

We have not gotten EES yet. IF you can send it that would be great,
otherwise I will call in for it a little later.

Don:

It was nice meeting you on the phone today.  I appreciate the time you
extended to me and
it was great to hear your interest in our power indexes/historical data as
applicable to your departmental needs.

As we discussed, I am pleased to mention, the growth and market penetration
of TNE is rapidly increasing.  In fact, over the last couple of weeks a
sampling of our contractual successes include:

A. Enron-specifically named license (3 users only) used for back office
accounting functions
    (note, this license is not for distribution and for WEB access and
indices only)
B  Top three (3) eastern power marketer serving over 43 million
homes/businesses
C. Top 10 energy company that handles approx. $250 billion in energy
transactions per year
   while producing 141.3 million physical MWh in 2000.

As mutually agreed upon, I will contact you the week of August 13th (upon my
return from business trips & vacation) to further discuss your requirements
in more detail.  We look forward to growing and expanding our relationship
with Enron and your department.  Thank you.

Gracias amigo, I really appreciate it.  I'm sure I'll have some good
stories to tell, when I get back.  I'll holler at you next week.

Later,

Don

PS Do you want me to put $20 on black for you?

Don:

I'm "touching base" with you in following up to our recent meeting and
subsequent discussions. It is my understanding that our TNE team (R. Heidorn
& G. Simpson) are scheduled to meet with your co-worker R. Imai on 10/8.
That's great news as we move ahead in developing our business relationship.

Coinciding to the above, I will be taking the lead in constructing the
license agreement. The main points and highlights that I would like to
review are as follows:

1. License to include Peak/Off-Peak data; w/ history and updates
2. Six (6) month term (no charge to Enron)
3. Distribution rights defined to departmental limits (TBD)
4. Portal access-five (5) total/specific users
5. Licensed access for use within particular database that Enron envisions
(TBD-10/8 meeting)
6. Enron will use its best efforts to make a market for TNE-Cinergy Index
7. TNE becomes active (through your endorsement) and operating on Enron
OnLine within 60 day
   cycle
8. Enron contributes trades to TNE index production cycle

Don, we are excited about working with you regarding this cooperative
opportunity of mutual benefit.

Please confirm your understanding of the above with me. This will insure
that we are on the same page and comparing "apples-to-apples".  Thanks.
