Stacy - 
After speaking with Rudwell about the credit amendment to the Master, I have 
made revisions to the attached document to reflect our conversation.  
Basically, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC is an independently rated 
entity.  As such, we will not be receiving a Parent Guarantee on their 
behalf.  I think I have removed the references to the parent guarantee, but 
can you please review the attached to make sure I did not miss anything.  

Rudwell - If I mistated anything, please let us know.

Thanks -

Gregg, 

As we discussed... I would add the following provision at the end of the 
second sentence in Section VIII A. (3):

;provided however, in the event that Seller's invoice to Buyer is delayed due 
to Buyer not providing Seller the ANR information in the time period 
specified in Section V (2), the due date for payment of the Demand Charge 
shall be the twenty fifth (25th) day following the service month.

Gregg, 

My thoughts on Allegheny's changes to the Master are similar to Mary's.  I am 
generally fine with the changes except 1) I would counter with lowering the 
liquidated damages to 10 cents (ultimately, this is a business decision)  and 
2) I would tell them that we need arbitration.  In some respects, it is more 
likely that disputes would arise under this type of deal so it is even more 
important to have arbitration. Please let me know if you want me to talk to 
anyone at Allegheny about their changes.

 Attached, for your review, are my comments on Allegheny' proposed
revisions to the enovate Master Agreement.  The short answer is that I do
not oppose any of the changes, but there are at least two items that I
consider business decisions.

Transaction Agreement #1
1 - MaxDQ should be 20,346
2 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payment equal to $0.15 plus 1.7% x Spot Price rather 
than $0.017 x Spot Price

Transaction Agreement #2
1 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payments consistent with Transaction Agreement #1 rather 
than $0.20 and $0.25

I think these are all fine, but I wanted to run them by you.  I have made the 
requested revisions to the attached Agreements for your review.  Let me know 
what you think.

Thanks - Gregg

Stacy,
 I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
obtain before granting credit to this company?

Thanks

Cary,  

I have reviewed Mary's comments on the Nipsco contract.  She makes some good 
points and it would be nice for Nipsco to make those changes.  If Nipsco will 
not make the changes, I still think it is acceptable for enovate to sign the 
agreement.

Mark, 

Jeff asked that I review TradeSpark.  All I could find for product 
descriptions were abbreviations of products that were not very clear.  If 
these are the only descriptions of the products on TradeSpark , they are 
completely inadequate.  If there are longer, more clear descriptions, please 
let me know how to find them so that I can review them.

Earlier this month I notified each of you of a request by Enron traders to 
access and utilize TradeSpark, a third party electronic trading platform.  We 
had some initial problems setting up the TradeSpark software, but eventually 
overcame these so that we had available a computer terminal (located outside 
of Sandi Braband's office) for review of product descriptions.  I am 
proceeding with negotiation of the access agreement and need to assess the 
status of the product description reviews.

Please let me know where each of you stand in relation to your product 
categories and, if you have completed your review, what matters need to be 
addressed with TradeSpark.

Thanks.

Good morning, Stacy.
 I have reviewed the Guaranty forwarded last evening by Rudwell
Johnson.  He requested that I get back to you with comments.  Please note my
changes on the attached.  As Rudwell suggested, in the second paragraph  I
have included language that limits this Guaranty to the two transactions
that we working on.  In the same vein, I have also included language (see
paragraph 17) that ensures that any other guarantees will not be cumulative
with this one.  I assume that we will do a separate guaranty to use as
Exhibit D to the Master Purchase Agreement.  Any questions, please call me
at 908-719-4228.

Sara, 

Here is the physical confirmation for the NUI deal.  I added an Event of 
Default under the Credit Agreement as an additional Triggering Event under 
the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.

I do not know what "any Unrestricted Algonquin Gas Transmission City Gate"

The changes look fine.  I thought I had already made them in the draft I sent

Stacy - 
Steve spoke with Coral about the Transaction Agreements today.  They had the 
following comments:
Transaction Agreement #1
1 - MaxDQ should be 20,346
2 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payment equal to $0.15 plus 1.7% x Spot Price rather 
than $0.017 x Spot Price

Transaction Agreement #2
1 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payments consistent with Transaction Agreement #1 rather 
than $0.20 and $0.25

I think these are all fine, but I wanted to run them by you.  I have made the 
requested revisions to the attached Agreements for your review.  Let me know 
what you think.

Thanks - Gregg

Hi Stacy,

Bridgette Anderson is currently briefing a new Enfolio Master Purchase Sale 
Firm with Cargill, but it is not an "Enfolio II".  It has provisions for 
collateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of attorney.

I know if it said "Enfolio II", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I 
believe it is good for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.  Also, 
what's the difference between the two contracts?  Is it just the collateral 
provisions and guaranty that make it different?  I'd attach a copy, but it 
hasn't been scanned yet.

Thanks,

Susan

Hi Debra!

As per our conversation, attached is Constellation Power's comments to the 
Master Firm agreement they received from 
Roy Rodriguez.  I will be happy if you can review this.  Additionally, as 
soon as I come to some agreement with their credit group regarding threshold 
and MACs, I will draft a credit worksheet and forward same to you.


Thanks

Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of
the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is
the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC.

The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent
with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to
enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and
discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put
closure to this agreement in the very near future.

How are things going?  I ran into Jennifer Minnis at a GISB meeting.  She

Diane, 

I would wait on sending the confirms because we are currently negotiating 
with NUI on the provisions that Sara added.  NUI has told us that those 
provisions are unacceptable in the physical deal so I assume they will be 
unacceptable in the financial deal.  Hopefully, this issue will be resolved 
tomorrow.  I will let you know the outcome.

Paul, 

Attached is the most recent versions of the above-referenced agreements which 
incorporates the changes you negotiated with our Credit Department.  There 
was one additional change to the Master Agreement to Section 4.2(ix).  I have 
also attached the letter agreement which cancels the physical gas deals for 
April.  Please review and give me your comments.

you.  It is 5%, but I am still waiting final verification from Human

The GISB working session was as exciting as you would expect it to be.  Most 
of the early termination and alternative damages provision concepts were 
hammered out.  A law firm (Shook & Shook) volunteered to draft language for 
the concepts agreed to in time for next Friday's committee meeting.  There 
was lot of discussion of what is going on in California and how the early 
termination process should work.  Enron should be fine with all of the 
concepts except the law firm was pushing an extremely broad set off right.  I 
don't think that is will go cross affiliates but it will go across 
contracts.  We will have to see the actual words.  I will attend the next 
meeting most likely by phone.  Hope things are going well.  See you in 13 
days.

Stacy

Donna:
 
Jeff Hodge asked that I respond to your e-mail.  

ENA does use the GISB contract to conduct its "spot" business.  By "spot", I 
mean interruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or less 
in duration.  Enron also has its own form of spot agreement that we use.  I 
have attached a copy of that agreement.

We do try to negotiate some special provisions into each GISB.  Our current 
version of the special provisions is included in the GISB agreement that is 
attached.  I do not know of any company that uses the GISB as-is.

We do not use the GISB for firm deals that are greater than one month in 
duration.  For those deals, we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement that I have attached.

If you need copies of actual confirmations, Bob Bowen or Ellen Wallumrod 
would be able to give you examples.  Form confirmations are at the back of 
each of the agreements attached.

If you need additional information, please let me know.

Cary, 

Jeff gave me the Conoco agreements to work on.  Unfortunately, I do not 
remember what he says needs to be done.  Do you recall where we stand with 
them?

Russell, 

Because it covers swaps, a financial lawyer needs to look at it.  Even when 
the primary exposure is physical.

Stacy,
Attached is a draft guaranty from Gulf Resources to cover physical 
transactions between their sub, Crestar Energy Marketing and ENA.  Can you 
please review this format and provide your comments.  The guaranty covers 
purchase/sale and swap transactions, although our primary exposure is only 
physical natural gas.  I am not sure if one of the financial attorney's needs 
to look at this too

Thanks
Russell


**Randy, Take a look at the guaranty and the types of transactions we have 
with this counterparty to understand the need for the guaranty.

I understand from Jeff McPhail of our marketing group that Enron is looking 
for
a parental guarantee from Gulf Canada for one of our subsidiaries - Crestar

requesting to have guaranteed).  I am enclosing a form of parental guarantee

Attached are the latest drafts of the Coral Energy synthetic storage deal 
starting in April.  These Transaction Agreements are, as Gregg says, 
Nicor-esque.  However, I did remove the secondary delivery point concept.  I 
did leave in the $0.20 and $0.25 administrative fee.

Jennifer, 

What a cutie!  Meg is adorable and so grown up now!  She should start talking 
before long if she has not already.  I'm sure that you are teaching her to 
say Stacy.  I hope you guys are doing well.  I understand Mr Espey is not 
doing as well as hoped.  That must be particularly difficult for you guys 
since you are not near by.

When do you think that you will be in Houston again?  We miss you guys.  We 
got used to your being around last year.

Meredith is doing well.  She is starting to sit well on her own.  She still 
does an occasional face-plant though.  It really makes her mad when she 
does.  She loves her exersaucer.  We went to Arkansas for Easter so Meredith 
had her first plane ride.  She did very well.  I can't imagine entertaining a 
baby for five hours on a plane like you do!  Meredith has not mastered cereal 
yet.  We only feed her twice a week which does not help.  We keep joking that 
she will still be on formula when she goes to kindergarden!

I will send some picutures of Meredith soon.

Stacy

Kim, 

I am sorry I have not called to see how you are doing.  How are you? How is 
Olivia and the rest of the family?  How is the house coming along?  

We are doing fine.  Meredith is sitting and eating some solid foods.  She is 
at a very fun age.  I am going to Chicago tomorrow on business.  I am going 
to have dinner with Esther on Thursday night.  

Talk to you soon.

Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have 
been "assigned" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party 
to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL 
transactions.

Thank you!
Cyndie

PS, Accounting was not copied on this message as there is no accounting 
impact on the contract # changes (all deals moved have production beginning 
6/1/01 (no additional production was finalized or cleared on these 
transactions under the prior agreement).

Stacey, 

I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because 
their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me 
the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what 
ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for 
part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.

I am working on getting the Bowie contract.  Meanwhile, I spoke to the B & J 
attorney.  He asked if Enron wanted to continue to buy the gas.  I told him 
that his client should contact you directly so that you guys could discuss 
price.

Stacey, 

I was in the MSN DSL pilot.  As you know MSN is no longer providing DSL 
through Northpoint.  You told me that Enron would not subsidize SWB DSL 
service which is what MSN suggested I sign up for.  What did Enron decide to 
do about DSL?  I could not tell from the ClickAtHome intranet.

I will have to look at the ICE agreement and see if we can add affiliates to 
the agreement.  Since the agreement was negotiated, if they cannot add us to 
the current agreement, then they should be able to submit a similar version 
for enovate to use.

in Attorney's Forms.  Until she is able to do that, you can find these forms 
as follows:

1) The Master Firm is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovate master

2) The GISB is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovateGISB.doc

Brad:

I got your message late Friday.  The B & J Gas and Oil deal was done on 
2/10/2000 for 10,000 a month @ $2.70 for one year (March, 2000 - February 28, 
2001).  The confirmation was sent in care of Bowie, Inc., another of our 
customers from whom he had purchased this production, and who received his 
revenue and did his distributions at the time.  I got another copy from Stacy 
Dickson, ENA attorney, last week and faxed it to Bowie to review with Cawthon.

This was not paid correctly by the payables department, and was paid at the 
index instead of the fixed price.  We sent the deal ticket to Wade Price the 
day the deal was done, but it was not paid correctly.  This causes these 
kinds of problems.

I am attaching some notes from my phone log where I had discussions with B & 
J (Cawthon) and Bowie at the time I locked him in, as well as conversations 
later in March when he said he had not received his confirmation (it was sent 
again).  Call me if you need anything further.

Jim

One more for the pile.  IDACORP has requested that 100% of the guaranty they 
receive on behalf of enovate to be issued by Peoples.  Peoples has prepared 
the attached reimbursement agreement which would obligate ENA to 50% of any 
payments made by Peoples under their guaranty.  We have issued several of 
these, going both directions.  Jeff is familiar with the concept if you have 
any questions.  Can you please review the reimbursement agreement, and if 
acceptable, prepare execution copies with initials?  This has a lower level 
of priority than the storage deals with Nicor and Coral which begin April 1.  

Any questions or comments, please let me know.

Thanks - Gregg

Jim, 

I found a copy of the confirmation letter for this deal.  I could not find 
the deal on the system so I will need to fax the copy to you.  Please give me 
your fax number.  I am sending a copy to Wade Price as well.  I could not 
find the cover letter that went with it.  My office was moved while I was out 
for maternity leave.  I don't think I ended up with all of my boxes.  I will 
keep searching and let you  know if I find it.

Stacy

Since this is an ENA deal, I wonder if you could provide me with a copy of 
the confirmation and cover letter where the deal below was mailed to this 
customer.  The details are in the bottom message. 

Thanks!!

Jim, my records show that the last transaction we did was with Bowie in May 
of 1999 and it was as ECT, not as EES.  I checked all my records and Petra 
checked my files this morning and we have nothing.  We also find nothing in 
the database.  Could it have been sent to ENA in error?  If you could fax us 
a copy of the documentation, we will be happy to prepare the agreement for 
you today and fax to the customer.  Thanks.

Could you look in your database of confirmation letters, and see if you can 
find one for B & J Gas & Oil, c/o Bowie, Inc., P.O. Box 1430, Clarksburg, WV  
26302?  It would have been for 10,000/month on CNG for the period 3/1/2000 
through 2/28/2001 at the price of $2.79/dth.  I had in my notes that I called 
you on 3/3/2000, and you were going to fax a copy to Bowie and to Robert 
Cawthon with B & J Gas and Oil.  I need a copy of that confirmatio, as well 
as the documentation on when it was sent out to them.

Thanks!!

Jim

Hey.  I've been so busy.  Most of May was a whirlwind.  John's sister,
Lynn, got married two weekends ago.  Then, we went on vacation for the past
week to Kiahwah.  Oh, and I switched jobs.   I am now the Managing Director
of our internal trading platform.  I miss Jennifer, she was really great to
work with.  Such a nice person.

How have you been?  How is Merideth?  I took a cute picture of her sleeping
from when you were over and she had tired herself out from crying (hee,
hee).  Anything else new with you?  Paige had her baby.  A little boy named
William after his pop.  She has taken to motherhood and absolutely loves
it.  She's even talking about #2 already.  She's always been a kind of
crazy that way!

Call me when you get a chance.  I still have the same work number
(713-207-1341) and John is out traveling all week so I have time to chat at
night, too (713-432-0470).  Not that I wouldn't have time to chat if he was
around!

Talk to you soon!

Your brain is working correctly.  I think that we should seek out and 
destroy  every old Seagull contract.  If we are doing business under any of 
them, we need to get new cotnracts in place.

Susan, 

I need to see the contract to figure out what is going on.  Do you know which 
attorney initialed it?  I can get a copy from him.

Hi Stacy,

Bridgette Anderson is currently briefing a new Enfolio Master Purchase Sale 
Firm with Cargill, but it is not an "Enfolio II".  It has provisions for 
collateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of attorney.

I know if it said "Enfolio II", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I 
believe it is good for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.  Also, 
what's the difference between the two contracts?  Is it just the collateral 
provisions and guaranty that make it different?  I'd attach a copy, but it 
hasn't been scanned yet.

Thanks,

Susan

Mark, 
In the course of two conversations with Paul Chymiy, he identified 5 credit 
issues.  They are:

1) The Credit Agreement is for a term of 364 days so it terminates on 
12/21/01.  They will enter into a new credit agreement but not on identical 
terms and not necessarily with the same lenders.

2) NUI Corp. does not have credit rating since the reorganization.  The 
credit rating should be tied to NUI Utilities.

3) The MAC should be BBB instead of BBB- for Customer.

4) NUI Utilities no longer owns the common stock of Elizabethtown and City 
Gas.  They are now divisions of NUI Utilities.

5)  The treasurer will not agree to (xiii) in Section 5 of the Transaction 
Agreement concerning additional debt.

Well MSN has found another partner but of course there are details to be 
worked out.  We do not know exactly when they will have services back but it 
will be in another few months.  We are currently talking to some other 
providers.  We will let you know more info as we get it or sign some

Stacey, 

I was in the MSN DSL pilot.  As you know MSN is no longer providing DSL 
through Northpoint.  You told me that Enron would not subsidize SWB DSL 
service which is what MSN suggested I sign up for.  What did Enron decide to 
do about DSL?  I could not tell from the ClickAtHome intranet.

		 Subject: EOL question

Long time since I placed one of these to you. . . 

Okay, 
NORTHEAST GAS MARKETS, LLC; An EOL approved CP (Investment Grade); We have 
have a new GISB [Choice of Law = NY] & a Special provision (13.10) that I 
haven't come across yet whereas  - - - - - -  Enron recognizes that NEGM is 
acting as buyer on behalf of certain companies ("Repurchasers") to who it 
immediately resells such gas at the Delivery  Points, The Parties further 
agree that the term "transporter" shall include any company acting in the 
capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser & agree that 4.3 will apply to 
invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received. - - - - - I 
can't see any reasons why this should cause this GISB to be excluded from EOL 
transactions, but wanted to make sure that there wasn't some deeper intent 
for the special provision that we would want to keep On-line transactions on 
GTCs.

Anything we should beware of?


Gee, almost feels just like old times. :o)


Thanks!
Cyn

Stacy,
 I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
obtain before granting credit to this company?

Ed and Mark, 

As we discussed, I spoke to Jeff Hodge and Travis McCullough about the best 
way to document this deal.  We all agreed that it is better to document the 
deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan.  
Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in 
fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and 
lenders.  The protections  and remedies afforded by the Master track those 
that Enron would have under a loan document.  Enron would be in no better 
position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document 
than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Additionally, I assume 
that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document 
this deal as a loan.

Please let me know if you need additional information on this topic.

Stacy

 I though it might be helpful to review where we stand on the various
agreements:

 1. Enfolio Agreement between NUI Utilities and ENA - The version
(including all Exhibits) that Stacy sent on April 11 (5:23 p.m.) is the
final and is acceptable.  I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's Notice
Information (Exhibit A) to Stacy.  Stacy, upon receipt, can you please
generate the final agreement?
 2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 with
Bob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow.
 3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter should
be addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed the
Confirmation).  Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI Confirmation
Nos. 31060 and 46669.
 3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version of
the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review.
As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be the
Guarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make it
clear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enron
had agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for the
Enfolio Agreement.  I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am not
satisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limit
the scope of the Guaranty is sufficient.  I think the limitations need to be
set forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If acceptable,
the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for
Swap V09140.5.

Per our conversation, attached is a revised draft Master Firm Purchase/Sale
Agreement between enovate and Oxy for your comment.  With respect to Mary's
last draft, I have changed Section 2.4 back to having enovate only sending
confirmations.  Other changes that were previously made by Mary were in
Section 2.3 which now allows either party can maintain recording equipment
and Section 8.2 which reinstated the original transfer language.

Let me know if you have other questions or changes to be made before it goes
back to OXY.  Thanks, Rich.

I think that we should add the phrase "or any increases to the MTV as a 
result of Buyer's Deficiency Quantity"  that you added in Nicor.  I left a

about the addition of the phrase when he calls.

your interpretation that the fuel charge, 1.7%, would also apply to the 
credits to the MTV resulting from our non-perfomance?  We tried to make that 
more specific under the Nicor agreement.  Steve has discussed the concept 
with Coral and they seem to be fine with it.  However, Coral's only change to 
the fuel charge language was including the term "sold".  Do you think this is 
sufficient, or should we be more specific?

Thanks - Gregg

Stacy,
 Please let them know that they are using the wrong assignment list.  Remind 
them that the list was changing as late as noon Friday.  They need to check 
the final list.  They can get that from George Weismann.

Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have 
been "assigned" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party 
to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL 
transactions.

Thank you!
Cyndie

PS, Accounting was not copied on this message as there is no accounting 
impact on the contract # changes (all deals moved have production beginning 
6/1/01 (no additional production was finalized or cleared on these 
transactions under the prior agreement).

Given the credit quality of Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) no 
credit terms will need to be placed in the GISB.

Russell - 

We are trying to get a 5 month sale in place with WEPCO - and Stacy Dickson 
said it would be possible to do the sale under a GISB if credit provisions 
were attached under the special provision section.  

The deal we are interested in is a 5,000/day sale at ANR/Alliance with a 
price of Nymex plus $0.14.  They would like the right to fix Nymex at any 
time.  What credit terms would you require (material adverse change, letter 
of credit) would you guys need?

Thanks - 

Deirdre

Melba, 

Per my e-mail, attached please find the new versions of the natural gas Spot 
GTC - on with and one without credit.  Also attached is a new version of the 
Firm GTC without credit.  There was a typo in the one I sent yesterday.  The

Long time since I placed one of these to you. . . 

Okay, 
NORTHEAST GAS MARKETS, LLC; An EOL approved CP (Investment Grade); We have 
have a new GISB [Choice of Law = NY] & a Special provision (13.10) that I 
haven't come across yet whereas  - - - - - -  Enron recognizes that NEGM is 
acting as buyer on behalf of certain companies ("Repurchasers") to who it 
immediately resells such gas at the Delivery  Points, The Parties further 
agree that the term "transporter" shall include any company acting in the 
capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser & agree that 4.3 will apply to 
invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received. - - - - - I 
can't see any reasons why this should cause this GISB to be excluded from EOL 
transactions, but wanted to make sure that there wasn't some deeper intent 
for the special provision that we would want to keep On-line transactions on 
GTCs.

Anything we should beware of?


Gee, almost feels just like old times. :o)


Thanks!
Cyn

Daniel, 

I do remember working on an assignment agreement regarding the assignment of 
the Columbia Energy contracts with MSCGI  to Enron North America Corp.  I 
will need to find the document.

It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals 
between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration.  ENA 
uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any 
length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board.  For firm deals 
that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one 
exists.  If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms 
and Conditions with our confirmation.  That answers your question of why 
Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place.

It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm 
agreement in place.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Stacy

Stacy, 

The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place.? Thank you for the 
fax of the Columbia Energy GISB. 

Please note that we have a Transfer and Termination Agreement (dated January 
1, 2000), whereby certain Columbia Energy financial and purchase & sale 
agreements were terminated by Enron North America Corp.? The Columbia Energy 
GISB was not referenced in the Transfer and Termination Agreement, so I'm 
assuming the GISB survived the termination process. 

Did our two companies enter into an assignment & novation agreement, or other 
similar document, specific to the Columbia Energy GISB? 

Also, please let me know what conclusion you and Ellen have reached in regard 
to the long-form/GTC issue.? I thank you for your help. 

Kind Regards, 
Dan

Michelle, 

Per our conversation, attached is a draft of an amendment to the Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement between IDACORP Energy Solutions, Inc. and Enron 
North America Corp.  which changes the confirming party to ENA.

Please call me at (713) 853-5705 or e-mail me with your comments.

Subject: NUI Corp 

To prepare the confirmation for this deal, we need to make a few changes to 
the standard form:

1. Incorporate the revolver document  Articles 3-7 by reference that I 
forwarded earlier.  I think this is the easiest way. We will need to make the 
appropriate modifications to change for our transaction type. Laura Falk at 
the company should be able to provide us with whatever information we need 
(name of agreement, parties to, etc). She can be reached at 908-719-4242.  
Since NUI must already comply with all of this for the bank, it should not be 
too burdensome for them.  If they push back, I have marked the specific 
sections that we need to include at a minimum.

2. We need to delete the reference to the collateral threshold and 
requirement to post performance assurance in the Master.

3. Do we need to do anything about the fact that in some cases we have 
redundant and perhaps conflicting defaults/remedies?  Or can we just state 
that anything we incorpoarate from the revolver document supercedes the 
Master, if applicable?

Can you think of anything else that I am missing?

Mark, please send me the updated model.

Call me if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Heather,

I am glad to hear you (and your car) are o.k.  We did not have any problems.  
Those pictures are amazing!  The video of I-10 was unbelievable.  Dan and 
Marianne went to I-10 and saw the flooding in person.  He said the video on 
tv did not really show how bad it was.  Is there an estimate on when B  & P 
will be back in their offices?  It would be nice for you to have a couple of 
days off.

Stacy

P.S. I heard that Monica Jordan Richards left Enron and went to Entergy.

Gregg, 

Here is the master as I think it stands.  There is some language added that 
Rudwell requested.  I am not clear on whether Randy O has seen the credit 
lanugage.  Let me know what you think and I will send it to Randy O.

Hi Debra!

As per our conversation, attached is Constellation Power's comments to the 
Master Firm agreement they received from 
Roy Rodriguez.  I will be happy if you can review this.  Additionally, as 
soon as I come to some agreement with their credit group regarding threshold 
and MACs, I will draft a credit worksheet and forward same to you.


Thanks

Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of
the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is
the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC.

The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent
with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to
enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and
discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put
closure to this agreement in the very near future.

Randy,

Attached is a clean version and a redlined version of the above-referenced 
document which incorporates the changes that we discussed with the exception 
of the end of Section 4.2, Section 4.5 and Section 4.6.  That language was 
added based on what our credit department wants.  Please review and call me 
with any comments (713) 853-5705.

Thanks, 

Stacy

Gregg, 

I had a couple of minor changes to the Reimbursement Agreement.  Attached is 
a redlined version which shows my changes.
