Rick - 

based on our meeting last week and budget savings information received so far 
attached is the revised headcount information for your review and comment

I have budget savings information from everyone except Jean Ryall and hope to 
get that information tonight; once I have all the numbers I'll send something 
to you

I hope to meet with Sue Nord today to talk to her about the cost savings for 
EBS G/A to make sure I understand what numbers she is offering


also - I asked Ginger to put me on your calendar for Friday afternoon 
(4:30-5:00) to go over headcount, travel policy, phone policy, budget 
savings, etc.; would you like me to work on the Europe, Asia and Australia 
budgets since those are now under your control; if so, are we looking for 
savings opportunities there as well

Thanks,

Eric

Rick - As requested, please find attached my proposed budget reductions for 
the remainder of this year.  Total reductions equal $168,000, which includes 
$35,000 of the Tabors TCC rcr which was originally approved for $75,000.   I 
also made a small cut in Travel of $10,000, but would be uneasy cutting 
anymore since we were very thin to begin with in this area  I have however 
reiterated to all of my staff, myself included, to spend each dollar as 
prudently as we can.  At this point I am not recommending any reductions in 
Staff, however, if things get real tight I may need to revisit the need for 
Teri Miller in the Concord office.

Looking to the end of the year, I estimate the need for the following:
 Florida - Retain Katz Kutter for the period July-December at $10,000 per 
month.  Current agreement is $20,000 per month but ends in June 01.
 Tabors New York/New England Support - Current rcr approved through April at 
$31,000 permonth combined.  I expect that we can cut that to $20,000 per 
month and will be putting in an rcr this week.  

I hope this is all we need to cut!  Please advise if we need to discuss 
further.

Steve

Rick - below are Harry's proposed budget savings; let me know if you need any 
additional information; I plan to go back and revise the individual budget 
sheets and once we get to an appropriate number I can have the overall budget 
numbers reduced with accounting; I'm not sure if you were planning to give 
money back now or later; let me know; thanks and have a good trip - Eric

Eric - my budget suggestion is this - I had RCR money for $350,000 related to 
Illinois (Com Ed) case.  I suggest cutting this back to $150,000 for now, for 
a savings of $200,000 of budget money.

I didn't have any other specifics.  Thanks.

Rick - 

I just got off the phone with Lisa and she proposes to reduce her travel 
budget by 10%; Lisa's current travel budget is $120,000.  The savings equals 
$12,000.  Lisa said she spoke to you yesterday regarding her outside services 
budget.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric

From: Eric Benson

Rick requested I send notice that budget savings submitted for consideration 
have been approved.  Rick advised that dollars relating to RCR or 
discretionary funds were not considered.

It is my understanding that Rick will be discussing the total cost savings 
and its impact at the next direct reports meeting scheduled for this Thursday.

The policy regarding travel and cell phone use will be distributed to all G/A 
employees later this week.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Rick - 

attached are the proposed budget savings from the Washington office; the 
Washington office proposes to move NERC (Richard Ingersoll and Charles Yueng) 
costs for travel to Jim Steffes' budget; I talked to Jim about this yesterday 
and he is ok with moving the costs to his budget; Jim indicated that he wants 
to have his headcount increased by 2 and the budget dollars moved to his cost 
center to reflect this change; the Washington office indicates that the total 
NERC "Savings" equals $112,000; including the NERC number the Washington 
office proposes a net savings of $240,032; the actual net savings should be 
$128,032 ($240,032 less $112,000); with your permission I will work with 
accounting to move the NERC costs to Jim's cost center and increase his 
headcount appropriately; please advise of any questions, comments or concerns

Eric
