Guy looks interesting.

Might be a good athlete that we could plug in to various assignments (EGM or otherwise). We could check him out from Foley & Lardner as well as Cadwalader due to our contacts at those firms. I haven't see the transactions list yet.

Is he open to moving to Houston? As you know, it is more complicated when we have to move someone.

Alan

Here is a candidate referred by Bruce Menke at Associated Counsel.  Bruce also forwarded me additional information at my request, specifically addressing why he has moved around so much.  I'll forward that on as well.

Let me know if you want to talk with him.

 Michelle,

I hope your week is going well.

Please find attached the resume of Mitch Ludwin. Mitch has great academics
(JD '89 cum laude-top 8%, Law Review, Order of the Coif, etc.) and extensive
transactions experience with an emphasis on finance. Mitch is currently
Senior Associate at Troutman Sanders in Atlanta. Mitch was originally from
New York and began his career practicing for three years with Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft in that City. Mitch then joined Mudge, Rose, Guthrie,
Alexander Y Ferdon, spending two years with the firm's New York office,
followed by a year and a half with the firm's Los Angeles office. Upon
dissolution of Mudge, Rose, Mitch joined Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &
Jacobson in Los Angeles.  Mitch then accepted an opportunity with Foley &
Lardner in Milwaukee, where he practiced four years. Mitch joined the firm
to participate in the start up of the firm's project finance practice and to
be closer to his wife's family. This area of the firm's practice did not
develop as anticipated and the attorneys brought in with this expertise
moved to other firms. Mitch joined Troutman to focus on asset-based lending.
I would be happy to provide any additional information concerning Mitch
which you may wish and to arrange an interview, if you so desire. I
anticipate receiving a transactions list, which I will forward to you. I
have also submitted Mitch's resume to Enron Energy Services for
consideration.

Regards, Bruce Menke

Michelle:  this is a long time friend of mine who left SMK with Mickey Sheinfeld, but would like to move on to something new.  Would she be a candidate for anything we need? Or anybody else you might think of?

thanks

Good morning, Alan.  Since our last discussion  yesterday, I have had a detailed conversation with Jerry Prager and am pleased  to report that, not only is he an experienced energy lawyer who is very familiar  with the coal industry, but that he is also experienced in the legal issues  involved in the freight and transportation of coal and other energy  products.  Licensed in both Texas and Ohio, of course, Jerry is an  attractive candidate.  Interestingly, when he had his own law practice in  Dallas ('97 -- '99), he represented Enron Oil & Gas in Mexico on a variety  of upstream transactions.  He is also fluent in Spanish.
 
Jerry is available to visit with you today or  tomorrow afternoon by telephone.  His direct number in Cincinatti is  513.721.5525 and I want to encourage you to call him directly if you are  interested.  I will be out of the office between 10:00 and 1:00, but will  be in the office this afternoon if you would like to visit.  Best  regards,

Thanks, Alan.  I just got off the phone with the other candidate, Donald
Duncan, and he, too, appears strong.  Donald has been an in-house energy
lawyer in Houston for 24 years, most recently with Eagle Global Logistics
(EGL), an international freight forwarder, which he left in May.  EGL is
suffering severe financial problems which comes as no surprise since their
principal client base are the computer manufacturers and tech companies that
have all suffered dramatic losses over the past 3-5 quarters.

Notably, Donald spent 9 years with Pennzoil's mining business and, as such,
is intimately familiar with the coal industry.  He also worked on a major
coal seam degasification project for Sonat in the '80s in the Black Warrior
Basin of Alabama.

Donald has the advantage of being familiar with both the coal and freight
industries and of being already in Houston.  He is very interested in you
and, as with Jerry Prager, let me encourage you to call him directly if you
are interested in speaking with him.  He is available anytime after 2:00
p.m. today and anytime tomorrow morning.  He can be reached at 713.515.4863.

Of course, if you are interested in additional information, please feel free
to give me a call.  Best regards,

Lee Allbritton
