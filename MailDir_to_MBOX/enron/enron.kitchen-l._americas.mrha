I think that John took the message to heart this morning.  I do not think that John's intent by speculating the Nymex was to detract from building the Wellhead business. I apologize for not knowing of the intraday speculative positions.  I receive his P&L daily and on average, his position is flat.

I have asked him to break out the subset of new producer counterparties that the Wellhead desk has brought to ENA.  Please find John the three seats near the East desk or the Weather group on 32.

I will focus all my efforts on building a wellhead business consistent with the expectations outlined in the meeting this morning.  I would like to have some additional feedback on the new entity ENA Upstream Company, LLC and third party transactions to mitigate risk.  

I will continue to assist the origination function to build producer volumes and improving the flow of physical information to the Trading Desks (Financial, East, Central, Texas and West). The Wellhead Desk will only use financial tools to hedge physical transactions. 

I will work with Jeff Story to improve the accuracy and flexibility of our systems in the areas of pricing, transportation, and forward curves associated with wellhead volumes. 
I look forward to providing you with the answers to the issues when you return from your vacation.

Louise,

I think that John (see below) raises a valid point regarding our credit dis=
missal of the airline industry.  Enron does a very good job "wooing" a sect=
or doing good times, but as soon as the commercial operations get tough we =
dump like a hot potato.  As such, when we will try to entertain the airline=
 sector in the future to do risk management and hedging through Enron, subs=
tantial ill will this from prior disposal will have been created.  Do we ca=

I have got to think that there should exist sufficient origination opportun=
ities for companies going into bankruptcy -- maybe for Lydecker's organizat=

Just a thought, Mrha

To all:

As part of Karen Gruesen's ongoing efforts to clean up the Bridgeline Income Statement and Balance sheet, she has been tracking the various receivables that have not been paid.  Karen has been working with Trevor Mihalik (CFO) and it is expected that the majority will be paid by the end of this month.  Unfortunately,  Bridgeline had not been receiving appropriate documentation with their billings. 

For any further information, please contact Karen Grusen at 36571.

Thank you.

Jean,
The CES asset management payments come out of Bryce Baxter's group.  The first I heard of this issue was about a week ago from Trevor.  I just received copies of the invoices from Bridgeline on 10/18.  Greg has been reviewing the Agreement and consulting with Legal to research the CES obligation, as he and I were not familiar with it.
I will contact Bryce's group to find out why they have not been paying the invoices, there may be an issue that I am not aware of.

Trevor has stated that he is using me as the point of contact for all Enron/Bridgeline issues now that I am with this group.  That is how I became involved with Bryce's issue.  There appear to be many outstanding cash issues between Enron and Bridgeline that have accumulated over the last several months and we are addressing them as quickly as possible.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.
Karen

Brian -

Attached is the listing of items that we have accrued but not paid as of Sept 30th.  We do have several items due to Bridgeline from Enron.  The first is that we have not received 16 months of the CES asset management payments from Enron (16 X $50,000 = $800,000) and the second is the Btu conversion adjustment to PAD gas for Aug and Sept that Jean has agreed to.  This amount is $274,000.  Net net, we owe Enron approx $226,000.

Give me a call if you want a detail explanation on any of this.

Thanks

Trevor

To all:

Last night I spoke with Trevor Milhalik about the cash distribution which would normally occur at the end of the year.  The most viable and quickest way to get the cash we felt was to increase the revolver from $35 MM to $70 MM because, as stated below, there exists significant current capital needs to fill the Enron #1 storage cavern.  However, even still, this would only ensure a cash distribution at the end of December - the normal schedule for the partnership.

There may be one more possiblity.  We could reapproach the board about the prior structure of levering up Bridgeline in order to extract cash from the joint venture - it failed last year because Texaco did not want the cash.  It may different now that Chevron is involved, but I doubt it.  My guess is that senior management (i.e. Louise) would have to put pressure on the appropriate channels.  I would rather pay a "premium" to Chevron/Texaco for levering Bridgeline than entering in a series of park-and-lend arrangements because we could get more cash up front. In addition, any park-and-lend arrangements could have negative earnings impacts contingent upon the shape of the NYMEX.

Regards,
Jean

Subject:	RE: Bridgeline Cash and AR

To all:

As of today, Bridgeline has $14MM of cash and expects to get $15MM from the payment of Oct receivables by the end of the month.  They have fully drawn down the $35MM revolver that we put in place earlier this year.  Trevor Mihalik (Bridgeline CFO) is preparing a cashflow forecast for Bridgeline from now to the end of the year and next year.

Bridgeline's major cash needs are to fund working capital (payables and margin calls) and to purchase gas that must be used to dewater the storage cavern (Enron #1) that we contributed to the partnership.  The dewatering process is now underway and will be completed mid-March 2002.  At a gas price of $2.50 and, working gas volume of 6 bcf, the total cash need for working gas will be approx. $15MM.

We are working with Bridgeline to find other sources of financing for the working gas that would enable them to make (and accelerate) the 2001 cash distribution to the partners.  Alternatives we are considering to fund the working gas: (i) increase the revolver from $35MM to $70MM,  (ii) find third parties (Enron ?) to enter into park-and-lend arrangements that would give Bridgeline the physical gas they need to dewater the facility without having to pay cash for it.   Most options will require Chevron/Texaco approval, which may come at a price.

I will distribute the cash flow statement when I receive it and Jean and I will meet with Randy and Trevor next week to discuss alternative financing/park-and-lend arrangements.   I have been cloaking my questions on the need for cash under the guise of putting together the 2002 plan (budget, headcount, capital needs, insurance requirements, etc.).  We should adhere to this commercial context so that we don't provide leverage to Bridgeline and Chevron/Texaco in any commercial discussions.  I will admit, however, given the headlines, it does not take a genius to figure out we need cash.

Regards,
Brian

Louise,

Please find attached the descriptions of all assets currently being charged to the Bridgeline Plan. I have adhered to the format that Brian Redmond used for LRC, Crawfish and Napoleonville and have changed those descriptions slightly.  I have included additional categories where relevant.  For example, "Capital Charges" identifies all assets being charged to the Bridgeline Plan.  

I will complete the descriptions for Crescendo and MEGS by tomorrow evening.

Regards, 

Jean

Here's the deal:
=20
There is some P&L that needs to be taken whether we sell or not: (1) a depr=
eciation catchup (impairment) that has not been taken of approx $647,000 (r=
emember approx $4 million was taken in the 3rd qtr, but upon calculation, n=
ot enough) and (2) a depreciation catchup for the 4th qtr (thru November, a=
ssuming a quick sale) based on a units-of production depreciation method (t=
o avoid impairment problems going forward) of approx $2.2 million.  These t=
ogether are approx $2.8 million of loss, but again, I have suggested that t=
hese need to be taken whether we sell or not.  The sell/hold decision re: t=
he Duke deal is a loss of $1.95 million (adjusted NBV after impairments/dep=
r catchup of $16 million, less the $14.1 of sales proceeds) in exchange for=
 the $14.1 million in cash.  So, sale is proposed at below book.  Jean/Lisa=
 would think of the Duke deal as Mariner/Burlington cash flows being discou=
nted at 12%, plus a premium of $1.3 million. Evidently they have found some=
 reserves upside, thus the premium above the base cash flow annuity. Any qu=
estions, pls call me - x 37665.

There are 3.0MM ATS warrants in two tiers.  One is a tier of 1.0MM with an exercise of 1.10CAD that expires 3/2003.  The second is 2.0MM with an exercise price of 0.85CAD that expire 9/2002.  The are valued using the Black-Scholes by Shona Wilson's group.  The model is signed off on by Jean Mrha.  ATS is publicly traded.  Current value on the GL is $762K USD.  This is after a 3rd qtr write down of $751K USD.  I would think they should contact Shona's group if the model that is used to value the warrants does not capture the true value.

Cris 

Bit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.

We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high. 

Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them. 

Thanks 

Louise

Louise, 

I do not think it is possible to begin selling the ATS Warrants at this time. 

Per the ATS Warrant Certificate, the ATS Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants may not be sold, transferred or otherwise traded until March 20,2002.  The Warrants are also non-transferable except to an affiliate. 

In addition, the ATS Warrants are valued daily using a Black-Scholes model.  The spreadsheet with the result of the evaluation is attached.  The current value of the Warrants is $762,600 USD using the evaluation model.  However, the current ATS stock price on the Canadian Venture Exchange is $0.97C with an Warrant exercise price of $0.85C for the first 2,000,000 share tranche. The second 1,000,000 share tranche has an exercise price of $1.10C.  Thus, the current value is considerably less than the Black-Scholes evaluation model is calculating.  

<<MPR 10122001 Gas Assets.xls>> 

If you have any questions please give me a call at extension 33541.

Louise,

I think what I really wanted to convey is the following:

1. John Grass originally headed up the Wellhead desk and Outsourcing efforts for the producer segment.  I wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services.

2. When the volume of the Wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of "contract focus" with Ocean Energy, Andex, and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued, I asked Kevin Miller to manage Producer Outsourcing and John Grass to manage only the Wellhead desk.

3. Based on Kevin Miller's memo (attached below), the Wellhead desk reporting into Hunter, I have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the Wellhead desk.

Louise,

I am meeting with Scott Josey on Thursday regarding Crescendo.  I am going to propose to him that all of Crescendo goes into ECR and he reimburses Upstream Products for incurred capital charges for 2001.   Since ECR is utilizing Nick Cocavessis's technical services organization for all infrastructure needs and he reports to Brian Redmond,  Upstream Products would not be charging ECR a fee.  The technical services organization is commercial support for Enron Americas.  

I have spoken to Brian and he is fine with my proposal.  In addition, Josey and I have had a brief conversation and on Thursday, I expect to be negotiating details.

Bearing in mind this 35%:65% split - how about we put it all in ECR and then you charge them a fee for all work you do on it.

Thoughts?

Louise,
 
Per our conversation yesterday, I am hoping that the email from Bob Superty is sufficient correspondence to enable John to hire Cindy Franklin into the Wellhead desk.  Please confirm this is correct by sending me or Jeanie Slone an email with your approval.  
 
By the way, Applied Terravision is up again today ( +.10) and has traded as high as 1.50.  The last trade was at 1.40.  In addition, I spoke with Wes about having eight seats on the floor for the Wellhead/Ecommerce effort under John Grass.  I will have to meet with Arnold today, because to individuals will have to move in order for me to have access to two vacant seats.
 
The need for eight seats is broken out as follows :
 
Kathy Kelly - Wellhead
Cindy Franklin - Wellhead
Dayem Khandker - Wellhead / Ecommerce
Judy Thorne -Wellhead
John Grass- Wellhead / Ecommerce
 
Jean Mrha
Vacant -  Expected Ecommerce originator need after expected closing of outsourcing deals 
Vacant -  Ecommerce Associate / Analyst
 
I am conflicted about having a seat on six and on five, but I think it is necessary from a Management/business perspective.  Do you concur?

I completely agree with Victor's assessment and have no doubt that Cindy will continue to improve and become an even more valuable and productive employee. I believe she is well suited for the new position in the Upstream Services group. 
 
Please let me know if you have any additonal concerns, questions - Bob Superty

Kathy, Per your request, below is the letter updating you on Cyndi's progress.  I think, she will be a very good addition to your team.  Her experience and familiarity with our systems/procedures as well as her  industry contacts should make your operations more effective and efficient.  If you have any questions, please let me know. Please forward this to all necessary personnel.  Once this move is approved, let's get together soon afterward and discuss a transition plan.

THANKS

Louise,

Reliant did not acquire the land on Friday evening because:
Enron does not have a complete chain of title. We only had it going back to our acquisition of the land.  They have gone to the court house this weekend to get relevant documents.
We will not indemnify them on potential environmental issues - but they should have done due dilgence this past weekend.

I am confident that we will send the land to either Texas Brine or Reliant.  Reliant will be contacting me today regarding the prior two issues and as stated on Friday, they have already cut a cashier's check for $3 million.  

Regards, Mrha

To all,

For first and second quarter, the following margin and EBIT was recognized from the Pluto/MEGS project:

1. First Quarter		Margin: $3.027 MM	EBIT: $ 1.328 MM
2. Second Quarter	Margin:	$1.348 MM	EBIT: $   .707 MM

In addition, Duke Energy Field Services (Stephen Noe) has contacted Kevin Miller and is interested in acquiring this asset. DEFS has signed a C.A. and Kevin and Jesus Melendrez are preparing appropriate documents for their valuation.

Although these earning were initially recognized by Production Offshore, with its dissolution, the Pluto/MEGS EBIT currently resides in Upstream Products Executive.

Regards, 

Mrha

We have noticed that we are taking earnings on MEGs this year which is probably the wrong thing to do based on the fact that we know that future income is negative we should be using the income to write down the holding or against future income.

Can you reanalyse the bookings this year and ensure we do not book any earnings.

Thanks

Louise,
 
It is my understanding that we will be buying the gas in Argentina from either the northern or eastern end of ENAP's production system in the Magallenes Region of Chile, down near the Tiera del Fuego.  I know that there is an interconnect point to purchase gas off TGS at the northern end of ENAP's system.  Nonetheless, you will find attached the presentation that the South American office put together for our visit with ENAP's management regarding Enron's presence in South America and the terms & conditions for a notional gas marketing agreement (the last three slides).  This was set up for delivery into TGS as outlined.  I have a call into Federico as well and will provide any further clarification if necessary.  Don't hesitate to call with any other questions.  We should have the revised letter agreement with ENAP signed up within the next week.
 
Thanks,
Chris

Louise,

Some good news for the weekend.

1. Unocal wants to enter into a LOI within the next 2-4 weeks based on a Term Sheet presented to them this September.  It is a Storage/Transport/Compression deal being led by Ned Higgins.  (Look in your Compression section, Upstream Products folder for more details.)

2. Eva Rainer has received four bids for the Napoleonville.  At a minimum, we call sell all 330 acres, get it off the balance sheet and still make $800,000.  Eva wants to do a counter proposal of $8500/acre.  How badly do you want to get this deal done this quarter?

Julie is going to come in on Sunday to look at my Storage/Transport presentation.  I plan also getting feedback from regional gas heads (Luce/Tyc/Vickers) as well as Neal and Hunter before meeting with Lavo on Monday afternoon.  I guess I will have a busy weekend and Monday, but I think it will be well worth it.  I have already briefly spoken to Hunter/Neal today - Neal is a much bigger supporter - Shively will do whatever Lavo wants.  I would also like to show you the presentation prior to the meeting with John.

Don't worry - I already have next Friday registered as a vacation day.

Regards, Mrha

Louise,

Unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to meet this past Wednesday. Marathon will not give Enron the opportunity to commercially manage Marathon Ashland's (MAP) assets which represents their refined products and crude divisions. Unfortunately for us, at this time, MAP has done very well these past two years (intrinsic position of short crude and long refined products) to warrant being the "crown jewel" of Marathon.  However, they still want to pursue the "hydrocarbon desk" for all of their Global Upstream business.  However, they have promised, based on the expected success from the business venture from Enron, to approach the MAP board.  Also, Marathon has assigned a second individual (David Risser) to work on joint opportunities between Enron and Marathon.  

As such, I have met with the appropriate representatives from Power, Natural Gas and LNG to put together a document clarifying our need to identify relevant data across these commodities.  I have attached this data request and would appreciate your blessing of the document.

I want to send out this document, via email, to Marathon late tomorrow morning.  

Regards, Mrha

Paul,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with Louise and myself this past Wednesday.  I felt that the meeting was very informative and that discussions between Enron and Marathon have progressed in a constructive manner to broach a potential asset management outsourcing arrangement.  

As promised during the meeting, I have attached Enron's Confidentiality / Non-disclosure agreement. Enron's appropriate legal contact for further questions or comments regarding this document would be Mr. Gerald Nemec.  He can be reached at (713) 853-3512.

After the Confidentiality Agreement is signed, I look forward to delivering a proposal for the above mentioned commercial arrangement.

If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.  I can be reached at (713) 853-1931.

Regards,

Jean

Importance:	High


I met this morning with Stephen Noe, the Director handling the potential transaction for Duke Energy Field Services.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss outstanding due diligence items and attempt to get Duke to raise their non-binding $14.1 MM offer.  However, the first thing Stephen did was offer  an apology.  Duke has found a significant bust in their valuation model.  ( As if we had not already had enough bad news today!) Duke had overstated the depreciation deduction which resulted in a tax credit for the project.  The depreciation schedule was apparently left over from a previous evaluation. In addition, Duke  conducts its evaluation on an after tax basis.  The resulting corrected evaluation with a 10.5% discount factor on an after tax basis yields a minimum value of $11.5 MM with no upside included in the evaluation.  

During the meeting, we called Lisa Druzbik and had her run the Enron model an after tax basis using 7 year MACRS for depreciation.  The Enron model confirmed the after tax Duke evaluation.  As you will recall, the guaranteed payments represent the bulk of the value in the deal.   As a side note, I believe that Duke did make an honest mistake and was not trying to re-trade the deal.
   
Stephen and I discussed upside potential for the project.  Enron ran a case for a hypothetical tieback in 2009 with 10 MMBOE.  Using a 25% discount factor this tieback has a $1.9 MM NPV.  Stephen had run a similar case in his evaluation process.   

I informed Stephen that Duke's original $14.1MM offer was on the lower side of Enron's expectation.  Duke will need to include as much upside as possible to get to an offer that Enron could seriously consider.  Stephen  aid that dependent upon the upside included, Duke might could get to the $12.5 to 13.0 MM range.   I told Stephen that I was not sure how Enron would view an offer in that range but do the best he could.  

We also discussed the PHA.  Duke may be willing to move forward without seeing the PHA in order to have the option of ratifying it later with Marathon if they so choose.

I will keep everyone informed and I would welcome any comments regarding this proposed transaction.


Thanks  ... Kevin

Scott,
It is my understanding that you will be taking the Mariner/Burlington Pluto transaction into your portfolio in the 3Q01.  I am available next week to train the appropriate person in your group on the deal background, current status, deal valuation, accounting, etc.  

Please advise.

Thanks,

He has not talked to me. He cc'd me on an email this morning - to which I replied. I planned on conversing with him this morning, but the email beat me to the punch.  He has been working independently on this effort. 

I had a lengthy conversation with Trevor last night, spoke with Sherman this morning and also met with Karen.  I have made Brian very aware of Karen's efforts to clean up BHLP - I do not understand why Deanna Washington is involved with BHLP at allm

Louise,
 
On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.  
 
Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen "victor."  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule.
 
Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction.
 
I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187.
 
Regards, Jean

At 4pm on Wednesday Liza arrived with the DASH.  It had not been circulated prior to that and there was no-one available to discuss the deal as Eva was not in the office.  Please  have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the DASH in advance of when you want it signing.

4pm on Wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn't give enough time to complete a DASH.

Louise, 

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM. 
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "Act of Sale" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental). 


I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding "war" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

We are working with Jesus Melendrez,V.P., and John House of ECR.  However, Kevin Miller has the relationship with Duke and was initially contacted by them.  In addition, Lisa Druzbik has done the most analysis ripping apart the accounting and cash flows associated with the flowline.

Importance:	High


I met with Stephen Noe over lunch yesterday to discuss the sale of the Pluto Gathering line.  As per our internal meeting on Wednesday, I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation based upon the data provided thus far.  Enron has provided Duke with the Gathering Agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream.  I informed Stephen that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering  line.  We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream.

Stephen informed me that Duke's evaluation to date showed a value in the $14 to 15 MM range.  Stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation.  However, based upon the notional value Duke has derived,  it appears that Duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor Enron is using.  I stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value.

Based upon this discussion with Duke, I would recommend that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get Marathon approval for release of the Production Handing Agreement (PHA). I will contact Richard Clark regarding the PHA.

If you have any questions please give me a call at ext. 33541.


Thanks  ... Kevin

John,

It is not relevant that it is not standard practice within ETS to grant origination for closed deals.  On ECF's behalf, Bilberry and Hilgert negotiated a storage transaction that brings significant value to your business for which they should be appropriately compensated and rewarded. Also, the PRC process within business units is often not an appropriate mechanism to validate a person's P&L for transactions closed across business subsidiaries of Enron.  

The value associated with the storage transaction was indeed a significant component of P&L to the overall Formosa deal.  I do not understand how you could infer that the deal was worth over $50 million to Enron.  At best, the current value of the closed transaction across EGM, ECF and ENA is under $10 million.  In addition, EGM did compensate Bilberry and Hilgert for their origination efforts associated with the unwind of the TEPPCO contract and incremental transportation volumes from Williams.

I certainly hope we can work out this P&L issue to incentive employees to work on transactions across business lines.

Regards, Jean

Jean,

It is not standard practice within ETS to "grant origination" in the form of specific monetary awards for specific projects/deals.  The individual's achievements are incorporated into the overall PRC and of course, appropriate rewards/promotions would flow from that process.  Messrs Bilberry and Hilgert indicated that the overall deal was worth over $50 MM to Enron.  The value of the Formosa storage transaction would be a very small part of that total.  Surely any specific grants that ENA wished to make could be amply supported by the larger value that would accrue directly to ENA.

John,

Thank you for noticing the sucess that both Chris Hilgert and Mike Bilberry had in negotiating and closing the many complex contract arrangements between numerous parties in order to get the Formosa deal executed.  I am also happy that Clean Fuels is pleased with their new long term storage arrangement with Formosa and am sure it will create much value for your organization.  As such, I am assuming that you plan to grant origination to Chris and Mike to compensate them for their time and negotiations with Formosa on ECF's behalf.  Please contact me regarding the number you would like to propose.

Chris has worked on a presentation for ECF on this transaction and I will be reviewing it today.

Regards, Jean Mrha

Congratulations on closing the deal with Formosa, TEPPCO, et al.  It sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players.  

Clean Fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with Formosa.  We will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters (timing, pressures, volumes, etc) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary. 

You had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal?  That would be very interesting reading and I would appreciate a copy if possible. 

Thanks again,  John Goodpasture

Jean,  We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc.  They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.  The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.  We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.  Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.  The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.  You may have already seen it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Dear Louise,

Congratulations on your baby boy!  I hope the delivery was not too painful and please don't be upset with him since he wanted to share your birthday.  Happy Belated 32!

Anyhow, on to business.  Needless to say, a lot has happened which is why this email is tardy.  I apologize, but somehow I think your time has been occupied as well. The following has happened :

?	John Nowlan is dragging his feet on payment of the $1.25 in origination due to Upstream Products for the Formosa transaction.

?	I will cc: you on an email which will be my response to Mr. Goodpasture's assertion that ECF does not need to grant any origination for the storage contract negotiated on their behalf by Chris Hilgert and Mike Bilberry.  Goodpasture believes they will be "appropriately recognized thru the PRC process."  In addition, he seems to think, incorrectly, that the overall value of the transaction was worth $ 50 million.  Perhaps I should show him my P&L.

?	I am having a conference call with Redmond and Hart to resolve the Bilberry title issue.

?	I feel that Delainey and Dietrich are trying to shut down ECS within Upstream Products.  I can not get any resources dedicated to price out the compression deals that I need to close.  Based on their lack of "capacity" as well as their prioritization queue (I'm at the bottom), I am being told by Janet to negotiate with Coops, Munis, and other regulatory affiliates for generation, T&D, and site profile pricing.  My intuition tells me that Greg Sharp is behind this directive and is influencing Janet's perspective.  (When is was a V.P. of HPL, Greg Sharp had the compression group report to him and was led by Mark Courtney - also at EES.)

As an aside, I am very disappointed by the bureaucracy of this entire process.  I have tried to be very flexible and at the same time, build a third party compression business.  I understand that their are significant resource and pricing issues, but I need human capital dedicated to getting these deals done internally.  The compression business is not pure retail nor is it pure wholesale.  But I believe, that it is a commercial group that could provide significant P&L if given appropriate resources.  I will be meeting with John Lavorato today to discuss these issues.

?	On Monday, I presented to the Corporate Culture committee a report which highlighted some EOY 2000 PRC statistics that globally represented Enron.  Michelle Cash had a hissy that I had access to this information and Cindy Olson had to step in and approve my access.  In fact,  I have attached the presentation given, but at the meeting, I picked up all the copies and shredded them.  Please be very careful with this file.  I am meeting with Michelle Cash and human relations to be aware of all legal ramifications for any further PRC/Management Research by business unit.

In addition,  I met with Billy Lemmons and we are going to set up two small focus groups (10 employees each) comprised of  Associates and Analysts, who rated at least "Strong" from the 2000 PRC process.  I would like to target some general Management and Meritocracy issues and get verbal feedback.  I would like to present my findings to the Corporate Culture committee on June 6.

?	The attached hotlist file also has an "Executive Sheet."  This sheet represents any residual origination positions from last year that are under my responsibility.  In addition, for the Hotlist file, each business unit sheet has their P&L represented.  This P&L combines accrual as well as mkt-to-mkt  margin.  This number will be different from the Management report since that file represents accrual margin or "flashes" for the entire quarter.  I am only representing "actualized" P&L thru April.

I do not know how you would like to represent BHLP.  I am making the following recommendation:

YTD 2001 Forecast in 000s    	(10,829)
YTD 2001 Plan in 000s	   	(13,490)		Assumes a $56 million EBITDA.

BHLP EBIT Variance		$2,661	

In addition, I could represent a quarterly representation as well.

?	Other issues : 	

I am also meeting with Lavorato to get the VAR for the Wellhead Desk raised above 100K to 1 million. 

When trying to represent the P&L for the Hotlist, I realized that it was inaccurate  (i.e., ATS Warrants value incorrectly as well as other issues) and I think now it is fairly clean.  I have started re-scrubbing BHLP P&L.

The storage monetization structure is getting interesting.  Turns out the ETS (Northern) took significant earnings to the bottom line by monetizing their base gas and did not want us to meet with the FERC regarding our structure. (The biggest concern of our customer list is regulatory - we wanted the FERC to "advise" us.  It was Steffes' idea.)  However, we did find out that Skadden Arps wrote Northern an opinion letter indemnifying them of potential regulatory risk.

Sorry for the book,  best regards,

Mrha

Louise,

I hope that everything is well with you.  Much has happened during the past two weeks and I will try to be as brief as possible.

?	Based on conversations and internal decisions that have occurred, Tom Byargeon and myself have decided to dissolve Production Offshore by the end of second quarter.  I have spoken with John regarding this commercial structural change and have also renegotiated the 2001 Upstream Products expected margin to $30 MM.  (The expected budget from Production Offshore was $20 MM out of the $50 MM for Upstream Products.)
?	I have attached a document that Tom has drafted outlining the remaining project responsibilities, market representation, and personnel redeployment.

The following individuals within Production Offshore have yet to be redeployed :

1. Tom Byargeon - He has been offered an opportunity to work with Randy Maffett, Vice President - Wholesale Origination, EGM.  Tom also will be meeting with Dave Duran tomorrow morning to discuss opportunities that exist within Generation Investments or Northeast Power Origination. 

 In addition, I want him to consider leading the Ecommerce/ Producer One effort for Upstream Products.  I desperately need a dedicated senior commercial person with contract negotiations expertise that can also see the financing opportunities that exist for Producer segment (i.e., wellhead connects, metering and monitoring equipment, etc.) through a Producer One transaction.  However, Tom has surmised that higher commercial visibility will be achieved by working on the financing of large asset deals within EGM or perhaps, in Duran's group.  I have assured him that the commercialization of the back and mid office is just as important if not more important to Enron's upper management.  Plus, I feel the closing of these outsourcing transactions will be more numerous by the end of the year than the other origination opportunities offered.

I know that he greatly respects your opinion.  If you could contact him (x30650) or drop him an email with your commercial perspective, I am sure that the correspondence would be greatly appreciated. 

2. Kevin Miller - mostly likely will focus on marketing and closing Producer ecommerce transactions.  In addition, Kevin has a very strong crude and processing background.  This experience would complement the Producer One effort as well support the processing needs of the Wellhead desk.  He could have career opportunities with EGM, but overall, is very enthusiastic about ENA's Producer ecommerce commercial platform.

3. Kenn Loch - has a very technical background suited for deepwater projects.  Since the responsibility for Mariner is within ECR, Allan Keel may be interested in his background.  Also, since the responsibility for the MEGS/Pluto deal should be transferred to ECR,  Kenn would be an appropriate resource for that transaction as well.

4. Lisa Druzbik -  is very familiar with the accounting details behind MEGS/ Pluto.  Has opportunities are within ECR and EES.  Most of her background is within the E&P sector.

?	I have spoken with Scott Josey about the impending dissolution of Production Offshore.  Since MEGS/Pluto is a deal with Mariner (and since Enron owns 97% of Mariner, the deal is analogous to doing a transaction with oneself), he concurs with me that the transaction should be evaluated with the overall restructure or potential sale of Mariner.  Should I transfer over to ECR all 2001 capital charges and associated earnings related to MEGS/Pluto?  Should this transfer occur as of the beginning of the year or at the end of second quarter? The YTD margin associated with this project is approximately $ 3 MM.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, Mrha

I spoke with Tad Herz today.  Tad stated that Cordillera is waiting on one other proposal.  However, Tad informed me that Enron's bid was currently in first place.  Cordillera should make a decision within a week.  Any suggestions or ideas to possibly influence Cordillera decision.

Here is the first draft attempt - since you will be in Monterrey tomorrow, I though it would be appropriate to draft as much of the final document as possible.

Louise,

Looking forward to seeing you next week.  I am sure that we will have much to talk about and I will compensate by talking very fast.

Upstream Products

I am meeting today with Scott Josey regarding Pluto/MEGS.  John Lavorato asked me revisit with him regarding this residual position from Production Offshore and did not want me to assume that although ECR is responsible for restructuring Mariner, that Josey would also take on the P&L responsibility associated with this project.  Depending on the outcome of the meeting will determine whether or not Pluto/MEGS ends up in the new Principal Investments headed by Kevin Garland or ECR.  Personally, the Pluto/MEGS transaction should be valued and restructured with all of Mariner and should be redeployed to ECR.  Principal Investments does not have the expertise or connections to evaluate this transaction.

Most of the individuals have been redeployed in Production Offshore with the exception of Lisa Druzbik.  Tom Byargeon has decided to work with Randy Maffett over at EGM.  I am sure that you are disappointed by his decision and I tried my best to keep him within ENA.  Tom wants to do asset based finance and was not interested in leading the Producer Ecommerce group.  I spoke with Dave Duran and impressed upon him how we both wanted to retain Tom within ENA and that his organizations could be a good fit with his background.  Tom met with Duran once and Duran had one follow-up phone call with him.  I briefly saw Dave in the lobby after their meeting and I impressed upon Dave that I wanted Tom to choose an opportunity that best fit his background and interests and hoped that he would stay within ENA.  (To no avail.)

Kevin Miller is going to lead Producer Ecommerce with Ken Loch.  I am very excited by this staffing and feel that within the week of their focus, they have accomplished much.  We are going to cold call Producers with market caps of less than $ 1 billion.  I have been very disappointed by the lack of flow from our Producer Originators and am not going to wait any longer.  Kevin is also addressing the need to have a sales agreement with HMS and as well as a need to offer crude outsourcing to the Producer segment.

I am very happy that I moved John down to 32 to be closer to the logistics organization.  It has improved the efficiencies and the P&L associated with his Wellhead portfolio.  However, I would like his group to be more concentrated together and not spread out amongst Natural Gas Structuring.   I would like for the Wellhead desk to have the seats that are currently being used by IT to support the Fundamentals group.  I think that the success of the Wellhead desk is more important than having IT to support the Fundamentals portal.

In addition, Ed McMichael has taken over the "management role" of making the Wellhead deals currently flowing to the Regional Physical desks and incorporating them into the Wellhead desk.  Although I appreciate his interest,  the desks need to properly rebook these transactions (since they are often in the system incorrectly) and John should not have to inherit these deals at mid.  In addition, John and his employees are working very hard to move forward with the "rollover" of these deals, but the desks need to move forward with the rebooking of these transactions in the system.  If they are not interested, Ed McMichael should not blame John. I will be attending the next meeting scheduled by Ed to move forward on this effort.

In addition, I have received no comments or inquiries regarding the Hotlist Update from Upstream Products that I gave to all regional heads of origination.  When we begin to cold call on the producer segment for the Producer One effort, we will disburse a list to the Producer Originators.

Bridgeline

I have been doing much thinking about Randy's motivation not to sign the proposed BHLP Compensation Plan resolved by the board.  As a Texaco employee under contract, Randy's contract has a change of control provision which can be triggered during any time, two years after Chevron successfully purchases Texaco.  Triggering this "change of control" would be the result of :
?	not being offered the same pay in the past,
?	FTC telling Chevron to liquidate BHLP (highly unlikely)
?	or, job responsibilities change.

Hence, if we try to sell our interest in BHLP, Randy could argue that his "job responsibilities have changed" since BHLP would be owned by a different parent firm.  If that happens, Robyn Davis told me that he is entitled to 2X his highest bonus.  (That would be quite substantial considering what he got paid last year.)  We will get the highest EBITDA multiple only by selling our interest with Chevron/Texaco.  Because of the "change of control" provisions with a two year time frame,  Chevron will not be motivated to consider outside third party bids. (Hugh Connett, VP, is under contract as well.)

As such,  Brian and I are going to meet next week with Robyn and Jack to encourage all seconded employees from Enron and Texaco become BHLP workers.  Besides nullifying any change of control provision existing for Texaco contracted employees, this action would alleviate many of the H.R. issues that occurred when we sold HPL to AEP.  More importantly, the employees of BHLP would be aligned with Bridgeline -- not their parent companies. (We will not get a higher EBITDA for a trading/marketing organization if all existing employees want to go back to their parent firms.)  I am sure that we are going to get much resistance from the Texaco board members.

Last but not least,  I heard that Lavorato is considering moving the responsibility of HMS and BHLP to Principal Investments under Garland.  I am disappointed by this action on many levels.  HMS is part of the value chain for Producer One (metering and monitoring) and impacts our Producer ecommerce business.  In addition, Brian and I have the history and understanding of BHLP to extract the most value for Enron.  I do not relish my role as a board member for BHLP, but I wonder why Lavorato has not considered my input when making this decision.

The attached worksheet has updated P&L  (accrual, other and origination)  from January - May.  (May accrual and cost centers were closed yesterday.)

Regards, Mrha

Louise,

Please find attached the revised hotlist for Upstream Products and Bridgeline.  I need to augment the transaction sheet associated with Bridgeline, but Brian is currently in a meeting.  Next week's version will include the strategies associated with the LRC/ Crawfish assets that are on Bridgeline's balance sheet.

In addition, the Storage deal update does not include any of the monetization opportunities of utility pad gas that Upstream is targeting.  We are meeting with Jim Steffes tomorrow.  Paul and I will present our Storage strategy on Thursday.

Importance:	High


I met with Stephen Noe over lunch yesterday to discuss the sale of the Pluto Gathering line.  As per our internal meeting on Wednesday, I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation based upon the data provided thus far.  Enron has provided Duke with the Gathering Agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream.  I informed Stephen that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering  line.  We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream.

Stephen informed me that Duke's evaluation to date showed a value in the $14 to 15 MM range.  Stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation.  However, based upon the notional value Duke has derived,  it appears that Duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor Enron is using.  I stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value.

Based upon this discussion with Duke, I would recommend that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get Marathon approval for release of the Production Handing Agreement (PHA). I will contact Richard Clark regarding the PHA.

If you have any questions please give me a call at ext. 33541.


Thanks  ... Kevin

Louise,

I spoke with John and at most, he believes that 6.5 employees should be currently staffed under logistics, scheduling and risk management.  In addition, overall, the Wellhead desk should create a net cost savings across the scheduling and logistics natural gas organization for the following reasons:

1. The number of schedulers needed on the regional firm desks should be less - 
	a. Scheduling between pooling points is relatively easy
	b. The Wellhead support is responsible for all the scheduling and logistics duties between Wellhead and pooling point - which comprise most of the deliverability risk
2. The Wellhead desk has currently, at most, four schedulers for the whole country - 
	a. How many schedulers are associated with the firm desks?  

In addition, if the Wellhead desk is being straddled with these fixed costs, then all outsourcing deals brought in should be pure margin, no?

I am having Judy Thorne and Kevin Miller dig into the details to verify these points.

Mrha

Linda
It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday at Enron Field and to learn more
about Enron Producer One. Looks like you have a winner. I define that as
solving a producer's problem before, sometimes, the producer knows the
magnitude of the problem.

please keep us in mind when you have case study success stories involving
pipe line and gathering systems and measurement issues.

Again, all the best to you. If I can help further, please holler.

Louise,
 
Please see the attached correspondence below between ENA, Duke and Mariner.  Via facsmille, ENA has received a non-binding offer of $14.1 MM with a proposed effective date as of December 1, 2001, but the transaction would most likely close mid-December.  A meeting has been set up between ENA and Mariner to discuss data needed to address remaining due dilgence items on 11/27/01.  A follow-up meeting with Duke is scheduled for 11/28/01.
 
If you have any further questions, please contact me at my father's house (1-716-667-0107) or Ms. Lisa Druzbik (713-853-9620).  Lisa has been working with Kevin Miller to divest of the MEGS flowline and will be working tomorrow.

Scott, 
Thanks for the message.  Duke's non-binding offer made today is $14.1MM in cash with a proposed effective date of December 1, 2001 and includes an acceptable premium over the minimum cash flow stream (Duke faxed the offer letter, therefore, I cannot forward it electronically).  

Duke e-mailed their outstanding due diligence items (see attached e-mail); we need Mariner's assistance to answer many of the questions listed and to provide appropriate documentation.  As mentioned earlier, Kevin Miller and I would like to meet with you and others at Mariner to discuss the due diligence list and action plan; we plan to come to your offices on Monday, November 26th at 1:30. 

Let me know if you have any questions or comments. 

Thanks,

As we discussed, the following is a list of diligence items that we would 
like to explore further.  This list is not all inclusive and we may need to 
discuss additional items as we continue with due diligence.  Please let  me 
know when we could meet to discuss them further.  Kevin and I had 
tentatively scheduled a November 28, 2001 meeting to discuss development of 
Purchase and Sale Agreements and possibly some of the items listed below: 

   Assuming that the MEGS system includes the riser and topside equipment 
   on Marathon's SP89 platform, we will need verify potential liability for 
   the same and any agreements addressing such access.  We would also like 
   to review the production handling agreement between Burlington/Mariner 
   and Marathon to verify the impact it may have on the future operation of 
   the system 
   We will need a definitive representation from Enron as to the status of 
   the producers committment obligations as of December 1, 2001 as defined 
   in the gathering agreements, including any credits due from prior years 
   excess flows.  It is our understanding that for the month of December 
   there will be a $93,000 credit to the payment due Gatherer and there are 
   no credits due in 2002. 
   In the Gathering Agreement "Project Payout" is referenced from the 
   Producer's JOA.  Please provide verification that this payout has 
   occured, the ownership percentage is now 51% Mariner and 49% Burlington 
   and that there is no future change that could affect the MEGS agreements 
   Need to review sample invoices, sample gas and condensate measurement 
   statements and demonstration of timely payment of such invoices by 
   producers 
   Have there been any leaks incurred and/or reported on the system?  Are 
   there any outstanding environmental issues on this system? 
   It is assumed that Enron/MEGS will be responsible to obtain any 
   assignments/consents that may be required to complete the transaction. 
   Please verify that this will be done. 
   The agreement stipulates that the insurance required is to include 
   business interruption coverage.  Please provide the coverage 
   declarations of the existing policy in effect for the system as a 
   reference for DEFS 
   Please provide a contact person who can discuss the environmental status 
   of the system with a DEFS EHS representative 
   Who is the MMS right of way owner and who is the MMS operator of record. 
   Please verify that the appropriate party has provided the MMS with a 
   "Certificate of Financial Responsibility" 
   We may want to schedule a site visit to SP89.  Please provide the 
   contacts to make these arrangements 
   We would like to review any additional pipeline engineering data and 
   material specifications available, inspection and hydrostatic test 
   reports, as-built drawings, environental reports/permits, rights of 
   way/permit documents and other related engineering and construction 
   information 

I will continue to provide you with additional questions that arise. 
Thanks and please let me know if you have any questions.

Congratulations on closing the deal with Formosa, TEPPCO, et al.  It sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players.  

Clean Fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with Formosa.  We will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters (timing, pressures, volumes, etc) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary. 

You had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal?  That would be very interesting reading and I would appreciate a copy if possible. 

Thanks again,  John Goodpasture

Louise,

Please find the attached update of all potential transactions and relevant P&L associated with Upstream Products/ BHLP.  If you have any questions, please contact me at work (x31931) or on my mobile  (713-302-4187).  

Quick updates by group :

?	Storage - We have been working a great deal with Regulatory affairs to assess and get over the regulatory risk associated with the monetization structure.  We (Steffes / myself) are having a conference call with Skadden Arps this coming Monday.  (Skadden Arps was the firm that wrote the opinion letter to Northern indemifying the pipeline of regulatory risk from the monetization of their pad gas.)  If you wish, I have a presentation delivered to Skadden regarding our proposed structure that I could forward to you.
?	Compression - Getting prices is still an issue.  Aucoin and et. al, have moved to six and we have dedicated a resource (John Kiani - who rotated through EES underwriting and understands EES' batch models) to help facilitate pricing.  Upstream Products has received most of the origination expected from Phase I, Formosa.  I left a voice message (in addition to the prior emails) with Goodpasture to negotiate origination between ECF and ENA for the storage deal Hilgert/Bilberry negotiated on their behalf.
?	Wellhead desk - is moving to 32, next to natural gas structuring, in order to be closer to logistics and have recorded phone lines for OTC transactions.  There have been many issues with our internal systems as well as logistics that are too numerous too mention.  Let us suffice to say, it has been a long two weeks.
?	Ecommerce - I think that the Andex VPP and outsourcing deal will close next week.  I have proposed a pricing structure to Phil Ballard and hopefully, Thompson will concur.  He is on vacation, but Ballard thought it was very reasonable.
?	Production Offshore - I am working with Tom to dismantle the group and associated responsibilities.

Regards, Mrha

Eric,
Thanks for doing an excellent job editing the press release; we all liked the new format.  

I made a few minor changes, as follows:
HMS paragraph moved to second to last, instead of last
Capitalized the words, President and Internet

Louise,

I do not think it is possible to begin selling the ATS Warrants at this time.

Per the ATS Warrant Certificate, the ATS Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants may not be sold, transferred or otherwise traded until March 20,2002.  The Warrants are also non-transferable except to an affiliate. 

In addition, the ATS Warrants are valued daily using a Black-Scholes model.  The spreadsheet with the result of the evaluation is attached.  The current value of the Warrants is $762,600 USD using the evaluation model.  However, the current ATS stock price on the Canadian Venture Exchange is $0.97C with an Warrant exercise price of $0.85C for the first 2,000,000 share tranche. The second 1,000,000 share tranche has an exercise price of $1.10C.  Thus, the current value is considerably less than the Black-Scholes evaluation model is calculating.  

 

If you have any questions please give me a call at extension 33541.

Kevin Miller

Louise,

Of course, as soon as I send off my email to you ... things change, but for the better.

?	I spoke to Nowlan and he is going to pay me by the end of next week and take me out for drinks.

?	Lavorato increased the VAR for the Wellhead Desk to $250 K.  In addition, he is having Gossett et. al fix the issues that were distorting Grass's VAR position.

?	Lavorato spoke to Bernie Aucoin to focus resources to price ECS deals.  He feels that if EWS is wearing the risk associated with retail transactions, ECS should not have to interface with EES originators at all.  In addition, he also understands that horsepower transactions have a combination of retail and wholesale commodity components.

I am off to the 2:30 staff meeting.  Hope your day is well.  I will give you an update on the other issues next week.

Regards, Jean

No problem.  Could I please have the BHLP update ready for next week's version?  

In addition, what was the outcome of the Mariner update meeting with Tim Detmering?  Plus, I have been thinking about the Mariner board member representation from Enron (mostly ECR).  Wouldn't be appropriate to have Tom Byargeon as a board member? Production Offshore does have MEGS/Pluto and their commercial group's focus is on the deepwater GOM.

Can you please add something on Bridgeline to your weekly deal update just so I keep up to speed on that.
Can you email to Tammie going forward as well as me as she will be keeping a file for John.

Thanks

Please do not forward this message to anyone.  This email articulates the f=
rustration that we have had with EES since the very beginning of this year.=
  Per your recommendation for pricing, we contacted Don Black who forwarded=
 us to Sean Holmes who forwarded us to Richard Zdunkiewicz.  Chris is meeti=
ng with Richard this morning, but I am highly doubtful of its effectiveness=

Like Chris, I am tired of communicating with a lot of VPs who are not accou=
ntable for their business.  I do not understand why EES does not see the va=
lue in capturing the tolling spread between gas and power.  Compressor load=
 is much more manageable than their standard retail customer. =20

If need be, should I go talk to Delainey? Whalley?  I am trying to be patie=

Louise,

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "Act of Sale" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).

I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding "war" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

John,

Thank you for noticing the sucess that both Chris Hilgert and Mike Bilberry had in negotiating and closing the many complex contract arrangements between numerous parties in order to get the Formosa deal executed.  I am also happy that Clean Fuels is pleased with their new long term storage arrangement with Formosa and am sure it will create much value for your organization.  As such, I am assuming that you plan to grant origination to Chris and Mike to compensate them for their time and negotiations with Formosa on ECF's behalf.  Please contact me regarding the number you would like to propose.

Chris has worked on a presentation for ECF on this transaction and I will be reviewing it today.

Regards, Jean Mrha

Congratulations on closing the deal with Formosa, TEPPCO, et al.  It sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players.  

Clean Fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with Formosa.  We will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters (timing, pressures, volumes, etc) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary. 

You had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal?  That would be very interesting reading and I would appreciate a copy if possible. 

Thanks again,  John Goodpasture

Louise,

I am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of Pluto/MEGS to Duke Energy Field Services as well as the sale of the Napoleonville Land to Texas Brine.  In addition, I am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in Dow Wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from Dow.

Are there any types of transactions that would be "inappropriate" to close?  For example, if we do an outsourcing deal for three years, how do we know that Dynegy will honor the contract?

Regards, Jean

Louise,

Please find attached the attached update of all potential transactions and relevant P&L associated with Upstream Products and BHLP.

Quick updates by group :

?	Storage : I am having a phone call with Dave Neubauer, V.P. ETS, to discuss Northern's monetization of their gas.  In addition, Skadden Arps because of their workload associated with representating El Paso in California has delayed our meeting for another two weeks.  I have expressed my extreme displeasure and am seeking other appropriate legal firms who are well versed in regulatory affairs to advise us on the our storage monetization structure.  Paul continues to get very positive feedback from clients.  We can not move forward without addressing the regulatory risk related to our financing structure.  Steffes is aware of my frustration.
?	Compression -  Moving forward on pricing from EES. Oakhill and Baygas still look promising to close this quarter.  Chris met with Duke and after the meeting, decided that Baygas could not be closed until third quarter.  Received an email from Goodpasture that cc'd Prentiss - have not had time to address it.  Will do so tomorrow.
?	Wellhead Desk - moved to 32. P&L is lower due to "system issues" between TAGG and Sitara for the booking of some wellhead transactions.
?	Ecommerce -  had a successful meeting with Apache.  Still waiting on the Andex VPP to close.  Thompson has been on vacation or has been sick.
?	Production Offshore -  I am continuing to work with Tom to reallocate employees and associated responsibilities.  I have not received any word from John regarding who will take on the P&L responsibility associated with MEGS/Pluto.  In my mind, it should be under Allan Keel, ECR, since he is working on the restructure/sale of Mariner. Tom will inform me tomorrow of his decision to stay within ENA or to go to EGM.

I also met with the Origination Regional heads (Luce, Vickers and Tycholiz) and shared with them a modified version of the "Hot List Update" worksheet.  I am trying to work with them to develop joint product / general origination opportunities.  I have not been given any feedback regarding the deals or customers listed.

An update on Bridgeline :

Randy Curry visited with me this past week.  He would like to hire some individuals into Bridgeline and it is his understanding that the "Board resolved" to hire new employees through Enron's benefit plan.  I do not like this type of exposure for the company.  Enron takes on all the benefit and hiring risk, but does not manage the human capital.  In my mind, Randy has dragged his feet on implementing a benefits plan and hiring appropriate human resources.  In addition, I am extremely annoyed that he will not sign the Compensation Plan because it nullifies his Texaco contract.  Randy gets the best of both worlds - to be a Bridgeline or Texaco employee contingent on the situation.

I have tried contacting Robyn Davis, Texaco board member, and we have been playing phone tag.  In addition, I have met with Jeanie Slone and am meeting with David Oxley tomorrow to discuss the overall BHLP situation.

Regards, Mrha

Louise,
 
Please see the attached correspondence below between ENA, Duke and Mariner.  Via facsmille, ENA has received a non-binding offer of $14.1 MM with a proposed effective date as of December 1, 2001, but the transaction would most likely close mid-December.  A meeting has been set up between ENA and Mariner to discuss data needed to address remaining due dilgence items on 11/27/01.  A follow-up meeting with Duke is scheduled for 11/28/01.
 
If you have any further questions, please contact me at my father's house (1-716-667-0107) or Ms. Lisa Druzbik (713-853-9620).  Lisa has been working with Kevin Miller to divest of the MEGS flowline and will be working tomorrow.

Scott, 
Thanks for the message.  Duke's non-binding offer made today is $14.1MM in cash with a proposed effective date of December 1, 2001 and includes an acceptable premium over the minimum cash flow stream (Duke faxed the offer letter, therefore, I cannot forward it electronically).  

Duke e-mailed their outstanding due diligence items (see attached e-mail); we need Mariner's assistance to answer many of the questions listed and to provide appropriate documentation.  As mentioned earlier, Kevin Miller and I would like to meet with you and others at Mariner to discuss the due diligence list and action plan; we plan to come to your offices on Monday, November 26th at 1:30. 

Let me know if you have any questions or comments. 

Thanks,

As we discussed, the following is a list of diligence items that we would 
like to explore further.  This list is not all inclusive and we may need to 
discuss additional items as we continue with due diligence.  Please let  me 
know when we could meet to discuss them further.  Kevin and I had 
tentatively scheduled a November 28, 2001 meeting to discuss development of 
Purchase and Sale Agreements and possibly some of the items listed below: 

   Assuming that the MEGS system includes the riser and topside equipment 
   on Marathon's SP89 platform, we will need verify potential liability for 
   the same and any agreements addressing such access.  We would also like 
   to review the production handling agreement between Burlington/Mariner 
   and Marathon to verify the impact it may have on the future operation of 
   the system 
   We will need a definitive representation from Enron as to the status of 
   the producers committment obligations as of December 1, 2001 as defined 
   in the gathering agreements, including any credits due from prior years 
   excess flows.  It is our understanding that for the month of December 
   there will be a $93,000 credit to the payment due Gatherer and there are 
   no credits due in 2002. 
   In the Gathering Agreement "Project Payout" is referenced from the 
   Producer's JOA.  Please provide verification that this payout has 
   occured, the ownership percentage is now 51% Mariner and 49% Burlington 
   and that there is no future change that could affect the MEGS agreements 
   Need to review sample invoices, sample gas and condensate measurement 
   statements and demonstration of timely payment of such invoices by 
   producers 
   Have there been any leaks incurred and/or reported on the system?  Are 
   there any outstanding environmental issues on this system? 
   It is assumed that Enron/MEGS will be responsible to obtain any 
   assignments/consents that may be required to complete the transaction. 
   Please verify that this will be done. 
   The agreement stipulates that the insurance required is to include 
   business interruption coverage.  Please provide the coverage 
   declarations of the existing policy in effect for the system as a 
   reference for DEFS 
   Please provide a contact person who can discuss the environmental status 
   of the system with a DEFS EHS representative 
   Who is the MMS right of way owner and who is the MMS operator of record. 
   Please verify that the appropriate party has provided the MMS with a 
   "Certificate of Financial Responsibility" 
   We may want to schedule a site visit to SP89.  Please provide the 
   contacts to make these arrangements 
   We would like to review any additional pipeline engineering data and 
   material specifications available, inspection and hydrostatic test 
   reports, as-built drawings, environental reports/permits, rights of 
   way/permit documents and other related engineering and construction 
   information 

I will continue to provide you with additional questions that arise. 
Thanks and please let me know if you have any questions.

Louise,

I spoke with Tom Byargeon this morning while he was at the Offshore Technical conference.  He has spoken with Rick Fowler, Dominion, and plans on visiting him in New Orleans next week.  The highlights from the conversations are as follows :
?	By the end of this week or next, he will have information on two more total depth wells that have been drilled.  Based on the rumor mill, the reserves associated with the Devil's Tower acreage are looking even more promising.  However, nothing is definite until all data is received.
?	Based on the well data, Rick has three financing options :
?	Negotiate exclusively with a company like Enron
?	Synthetic lease financing with a commercial bank
?	Rebid
?	Since Dominion is now 80% owner in Devil's Tower (bought out Mariner's 20%), the credit profile of the project looks better.  (Pioneer is the other 20%.)  Rick realizes his mistake going with a company that has no equity backing and has egg on his face with upper management.  My concern is that based on his experience, he will take the easy way out and align himself with a commercial bank.
?	Enron has the following in their favor:
?	Convergent and Enron's bid were very similar except Convergent had Aker.  (Dominion wanted a guarantee of an Aker spar.) Tom has spoken with Bob O'Sullivan from Aker and he is interested in aligning himself with Enron.  As such, we can bring Aker back to the table.
?	Dominion wants to spend dollars on "steel" for the project by the end of June.  As such, Dominion will have to make a decision quickly because it will affect whether Devil's Tower becomes an on-balance or off-balance sheet transaction.  I think that Dominion would prefer an off balance sheet deal.
?	Dominion won't rebid because the other counterparties were not competitive relative to Enron or Convergent.


So, I think our true competition is against a commercial bank for synthetic lease financing.  Either way,  we will have an answer quickly and since the gossip on Convergent is out, I think it will stregthen our position on other spar bids (ie., Medusa).

Regards, Mrha

Can you get someone in your group to take responsibility for getting me the deal status report you gave me earlier this week to me on a weekly basis with updates on each deal.

(I am trying to get my life sorted out - prior to disappearing)..

I will be picking up emails after the initial pain is over.

FYI.  Please note that the pricing to Peoples will be under a netback arrangement and has changed from its original proposal.  However, it will be for the same original volume of 30,000 mmbtu/day from the 30 wells.  Enron only has to schedule from 3 meters, not 30 wells.  As such, the inital pricing of $.01/ mmbtu no longer applies.

Linda Roberts, George Smith and I had a meeting with Rick Fox, CFO for Peoples Energy Production (PEP).  Rick provided our group with a detailed description of the services required by PEP. The scope of services has changed.  The 30 wells we originally priced all feed into three common points reducing the work required by logistics.  PEP does not need access to our system.  ENA Upstream will be marketing all the supply under a net back arrangement.

Enron Producer One will include ENA and ATS.   ENA will provide monthly reports to PEP and ATS related to the metered volumes and prices.  ATS will provide the E&P revenue distributions back to PEP. 

We will be making our proposal to PEP on Monday April 30, 2001.

Louise,

Yesterday afternoon I spoke with Walt Madro, Sr. Vice President of Global Gas and LNG, regarding Marathon's decision not to pursue a marketing/trading relationship with Enron.  Walt further clarified Marathon's poisition :

Marathon is in final negotiations to acquire a firm with both Upstream assets and a small, niche marketing arm.
Steve Lowden told Walt to hold off on the negotiations with Enron because of the acquisition of this firm and the potential duplication of marketing compentencies. (??)
I asserted that this firm, even if acquired, does not have the premier gas and power franchise like Enron and Walt agreed.
As such, Walt will contact me when the deal is completed - expected date is before the end of the year.

I will stay in contact with Walt and try to identify the firm being acquired.  

Ultimately, I do not like how this "smells."  I would like to have a conversation with Lowden because the opportunity cost of not having a marketing/trading relationship with Enron versus acquiring this small firm (albeit receiving strategic Upstream assets), I can not compute intellectually.  Do you agree?

Mrha

Louise,

I think that Shelley Corman would be best suited to run the sub-committee during your maternity leave.  I think that I am perceived as too commercial focused (with emphasis on the Associate/Analyst program) and in addition, her representation of ET & S would balance the leadership of the other sub-committees.  

Besides, I think you know I will be active participant regardless of my assigned role.

Regards, Jean

Louise,

Attached is the worksheet for both second quarter and YTD gross margin numbers for Upstream and Bridgeline, broken out by originator and project.

Please read the following bullet points that explain the derivation of gross margin and primary contributors to each:

?	J.M. Huber - was a producer netback transaction which transported distressed Rockies gas and transported it on Medicine Bow and Trailblazer, landing the gas at NGPLOK- Gage.  This Gage gas was sold to the Central desk and the West desk kept the segmentation optionality associated with the transport. The transaction was booked in fourth quarter, 2000 and was attributed to Mark Whitt.  He received credit for this transaction in EOY PRC.  At the time of the transaction, Mark reported to me.  

I have this transaction because ENA acquired Trailblazer transport on behalf of J.M. Huber.  The FERC approval certificate for the Trailblazer transaction was not approved until second quarter, 2001.  The $5.8 MM reflects the P&L associated with just the assignment of the Trailblazer transport, the remaining P&L associated with this producer netback deal was captured last year.  

?	Transmission Congestion Contract- (TCC) is the right to collect, or the obligation to pay, the Day-Ahead Congestion Rents associated with one (1) megawatt ("MW") of transmission between a specified Point of Injection ("POI") and specified Point of Withdrawal ("POW").  The Day-Ahead Congestion Rents are determined by the difference in the Congestion Component of the Day-Ahead Prices at the POW of the TCC and the Congestion Component of the Day-Ahead Prices at the POI of the TCC, for each hour of the effective period. 
I have this transaction because the Transmission Origination group reported to me last year.  The group was ultimately disbanded and reallocated.  Maria Tefel and Peter Bennett, both analysts, calculate the associated P&L from these congestion contracts.  These contracts end in November 2001.
NOTE : All transactions in Executive are P&L generated last year, but for various reasons could not be declared.  I handle all the administrative and tracking to make sure that the P&L shows up for ENA's behalf.  In addition, the expected budget for Upstream Products of $30 MM does not include Executive since that P&L is almost guaranteed and their product success should be differentiated. The Upstream Product budget goals are list below - 

	Storage, $8MM; ECS, $16MM;  Wellhead Desk, $2MM;  Producer Ecommerce, $4MM

?	Formosa
Upstream Products partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production. The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities. In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. 
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
Bieniawski negotiated with Hilgert for 10% of the gross margin associated with Formosa.  Bieniawski negotiated with Texas Brine to provide the NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons.  This storage capacity was key to Formosa Hydrocarbons to handle the NGL production expected and anticipated from the GOM.
Since John Goodpasture, ECF, refused to acknowledged any value associated with the propylene storage agreement they entered into with Formosa Plastics (negotiated by Hilgert/ Bilberry), I granted out $500 K in origination from Executive which was dispensed 90% ECS and 10% Storage.  Based on conservative assumptions, I expect this transaction to generate a minimum of $2.5 MM (P.V.) for ECF.
Theoretically, the $3.825 MM next to Chris Hilgert's name should be shared with Mike Bilberry, but since the Enron value associated with Formosa was much greater than the P&L reflected in Upstream Products, please keep this in mind. 
?	Hubbard was a compression transaction closed in 2000. The MTM value recognized upfront for this transaction was based on minimum, guaranteed load profiles for the electric horsepower. With this compression transaction, there is significant accrual earnings potential if the electric compressor is run at a higher load profile because the shippers pay in mmbtu to the compressor owner, who then gives the natural gas to ECS LLC where it is monetized.   Mark Knippa closed this transaction and is responsible for coordinating with Carol Carter the accrual opportunities for ENA.
?	Pluto / MEGS - When I was examining my capital charges for 2001, I assigned Lisa Druzbik to analyze all accounting, cashflows and capital charges associated with this project.  Although the gross margin associated with this transaction is not originated, she did a great job creating the project proforma and helping me reassign this deal to ECR / Mariner.
?	Tennessee Gas Pipeline was the virtual compression deal closed at the end of second quarter by Chris Meyer.  A "virtual compression" deal maintains the contractual obligation to fulfill the physical delivery of molecules and circumvents the need for running compression.  The Wellhead desk sold 1.25 BCF to Tennessee and will deliver it into a storage facility, providing adequate pressure not to run their "expensive" electric compression during the summer  for storage withdrawals.  ENA captured value by selling gas above market and also received intra-month flexibility for the delivery of the gas into storage.
You have already received a memorandum from John Grass to me discussing his accomplishments YTD for the Wellhead desk and Producer Ecommerce.  If you need further clarification, please let me know.  I know this email is long, but the devil is in the details.  I will discuss the $1 MM in origination associated with BHLP as well as my accomplishments in a follow up email.
Mrha

Louise,

Attached are the balance sheet descriptions for MEGS and Crescendo.  I do not have the aggregate book value numbers associated with Crescendo since ENA Upstream Products only has a 35% interest.

Regards, 

Jean
