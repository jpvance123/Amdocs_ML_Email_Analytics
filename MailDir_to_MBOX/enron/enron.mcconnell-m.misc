FYI - I spoke with John Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.  He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.  If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.

Subject:	Bloomfield to Gallup Pigging

To recap past conversations, Bloomfield to Gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last February.  It is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig.  If this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity, re-application of the DRA will be considered.

How does pigging Bloomfield to Gallup the first week in October sound?  Darrell pointed out that would provide a week's run time on the Gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for September 29.

I suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig.  The afternoon of Monday, October 1, a conference call would be held.  If there were no complications with Gallup or any other issues, the pig run would be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday.

If you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Also please let me know if having the conference call at 2:00 p.m., CST, Monday, October 1, would work for you, and if not, then what time would be good.  I will plan on sending out the conference number and code next Monday, September 24.

Thanks,


John

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

I'm glad you can make it.  To get to the OU course from I-35, take State
Highway 9 East toward campus.  Exit left (North) on Jenkins.  Go past Lloyd
Noble Center and turn right (at signal light) on Constitution.  Go about 1/2
mile and turn left onto Par Drive.  They will start serving lunch about
11:30 and will put out range balls before then.  Some people start showing
up around 10:30 or earlier to hit balls before lunch.  I'll be there much
earlier.  We have a shotgun start at 1:00.
	FYI: The following Sig Eps (26) are currently signed up to play:
You, me, Chris Walker, Jon Armstrong, Craig Perkins, Scott Smith, David
Newman, Scott Weed, Greg Dial, Bruce Kennedy, Todd Skinner, Brian Cain,
Kevin Holland, Thomas Burleson, Rick Sheer, John Payne, Brad McNeese, Jeff
James, Bradley Watson, Bradford Watson, Joe Ong, Chip Long, Chris
Papasarantou, Brad Culver, Jeff Marley and Brad Schick.  Usually playing,
who I have yet to hear from, are Jeff Black, Brent McCutcheon, Daryl Deaton,
Russ Brudner, Craig Dean, Terry Mosslander and a couple of other younger
guys.

I have arranged to take off this Friday, so I will be able to attend.  I
guess I'll get the directions to the golf course and other details from
Weed and Dial.  If the teams are all full, put me on their team.
Otherwise, I'll play with anyone.  My game has gone down the tubes since
I started the international work.  I hope to take care of that problem
soon.....put me down as a 24 handicap.

I look forward to seeing you and the rest of the guys,

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%	
Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9%	
Entrepreneurial	28.5%	37.8%	23.7%	10.0%	
Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8%	
Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2%	
Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)
?         Press the # key

Hey Mark,  (as they used to say in London)

You're right: i came down here in the beginning of the month and I am now slowly setting up shop down here in wonderful Rio de Janeiro.   Things are going well, but the jobsearch is not gonna be easy now that we are facing a worldwide recession.

I saw that Enron took a huge beating today after some SEC inquiry.  Nasty stuff, if you ask me.  From being the darling on Wall Street, we are now back to being the ugly duckling (old Danish fairytale, of course).
 
I can understand that your are happy about being out of EBS, ?cos it seemed like you were often stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Maybe the pipeline business is a little safer....maybe.   Anyway, I'd like to say that it was also a great pleasure to work with you: it's refreshing to work with somebody stable, smart and trustworthy.  

I did meet up with Martin briefly as he joined in for my goodbye party in London.  His e-mail address is mjoergensen@netlane.com <mailto:mjoergensen@netlane.com>     He also has quite an uphill struggle in front of him:  looking to start up a sort of recruiting company that exploits the differences in wages between eastern and western telecomengineers.   With wife and three kids waiting at home, it's not a position that I envy him, frankly.
 
Well, young man.  Take care with strange looking envelopes containing white sugar etc.   If you feel that it's getting too crazy up there, you know that you will always have a place to stay in calm (!) Rio de Janeiro.

Christian, 
How's it going in Brazil? I know you are happy to be back. 
I transferred out of EBS and got back into the gas business. I'm 
working for the pipeline group. The people here are very nice and I'm 
glad to be back in this industry. Although, I must say that I will miss 
London and working with people like yourself. 
I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day. Do you happen to 
know his email address? Please let me know. 
I hope all is well down south.

This is the final OBA letter that we should be using to terminate the volum=
etric OBAs.  Lee will be down sometime tomorrow afternoon to review all our=
 letters.

Subject:=09TW OBAs Calling for Volumetric Settlement

Lee, as I mentioned on Friday, the purpose of the attached letter is to ter=
minate the volumetric OBAs and revert to the tariff OBA to avail ourselves =
of the "hammer" in Section 4(b) of the tariff form (Sheet 147) which permit=
s us to credit the operators' scheduled volumes to the imbalance, ie, confi=
scate their gas.  I'm told that the subject OBAs were individually negotiat=
ed and deviate from the tariff in one way or another.  They also said that =
these OBAs allow cashout, but don't require it, and that's the problem:  Th=
e operators are not voluntarily paying back the gas because in many locatio=
ns (ie, San Juan), the pipeline is full and they don't want to short their =
markets.  Because I haven't seen any of the agreements that we propose to t=
erminate (the TW people have just finished briefing them), I told the group=
 that an attorney needs to look at each one to make sure that we cannot, in=
 fact, force cashout.  In most of them, I'm told, cashout is at the option =
of the party owing the imbalance. =20

As I also mentioned, this letter is a template; a starting point.  It must =
be tailored to each OBA being terminated. For example, the Section numbers =
are not filled in, and must be supplied. You will note in the second paragr=
aph of the letter that we say, essentially, that in capacity-constrained ar=
ea, if volumetric settlement is to occur, it will need to be accomplished t=
hrough crediting their scheduled volumes to the imbalance.  From my convers=
ations with TW, my understanding is that most of the volumetric OBAs do not=
 have a provision expressly permitting us to do that.  Indeed, as I mention=
ed above, that's my understanding of why we're terminating the volumetric O=
BAs.  Even if there is no provision in the subject OBAs for crediting sched=
uled volumes, my opinion is that we can offer that as an option, because th=
at is still a way of balancing "in kind", but omit the reference to the agr=
eement (as I have noted with brackets).  If they don't want to do that, cas=
hout is the only other option; that's our way of forcing cashout. =20


Thanks for your help, and if you need help, you might ask Maria or Dari.  H=
owever, I don't envision that it will take much time to do any one letter..=
...............Tony

Dear Londoners,
 
Time has come for me to say goodbye to England and London and pursue my big dream of living in Brazil (again).  
 
While I will almost certainly not miss London itself, I will surely miss the great international community that exists in this town.  The sheer size, internationalism, diversity and at the same time homogeneity of this crowd is almost unparalleled and has made my stay in London quite enjoyable and interesting.
 
In order to celebrate my departure, I have set up two independent venues for us to get together.  In the unconventional style that you have come to expect, this will take place this Tuesday, the 2nd of October at the following places:
 
1) Winebar happyhour (for the busy City-people). From 6.30-9pm.  The winebar is located at 3 Kings Arms Yard, London, EC2 (nearest tube station is Bank).
 
2) Koha Bar (for East End boys and West End girls).  From 9pm to midnight. This bar/restaurant is located right behind Leicester Sq. tube at 11 St. Martins Ct., London, WC2N

 
I truly hope to see you there.  In the case you cannot make it, I have enclosed my Rio de Janeiro address below...
 
 
cK ;)

Mark,
Do you have copies of your March, April, and June 2000 expense reports?  You have an outstanding recievable balance with Enron totaling $10,962.03.  If you have copies of these reports your balance can be cleared.  There are also an oustanding items totaling $143.39 from 1998 &1999.  It looks like you may have only partially expensed a $500 dollar advance that was recieved in 1998.  If you can provide me with information to resolve these items it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Brea

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?	A "How to Exercise Options" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Please take time to review this material.  It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative.

Mark:  Greetings.  I'm glad to hear that you might make it to the Steve Couch Memorial Golf Tournament this Friday.  If you want to play, we have a place for you.  We will either put you with a team that needs a fourth, or simply put you on a foursome if other teams are filled.  I know that Brad Schick is in the same boat that your are, so I'm looking for a team for him also.  Whatever we do, we will find a place for you.  I hope you can get off work and join us.  Please let me know if Dial's team needs you or you find a spot on another team.  I look forward to seeing you Friday.   - Donnie

All - 

I have had a wonderful time working with each of you over the course of the last year on various projects here at EBS.  But it is time that I move on to the next phase of my business and personal life.  Today is my last day here in the office.  I wish all of you the best of luck in your endeavors.

I would love to keep in touch and hope that you feel the same.  My e-mail address is marksolana@yahoo.com.  As most of you know, my next career opportunity is most likely going to involve a relocation to the San Francisco area (I should know definitively by next Friday July 27th).  I'll forward additional contact information for out there once I am settled.

Hope to hear from you in the future.

Mark,

"Godav" to you too. And great to hear from you again.

Yes, certainly the world has changed since we last met. As it turned out I was 
in the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep 11. And to all of 
us in London, that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in the 
States. 

- With one exception: We have had terrorism here for a very long time. So much 
so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRA 
semtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one...

And life goes on. I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the traffic 
every day, and that I shall have to go someday anyway. So even though London 
probably is high on the hit list, I have not changed my lifestyle significantly.

Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe. Personally if 
find it a shame, since I rather valued the people in the group, but probably it 
was inevitable.

But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron. 
Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp, that sector is doing fine as a whole.

My own stray into telecomms components did not last long. I was out after 3 
months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US.

Now I have ventured into Executive Search, where I am working as COO for a 
small group with 70 staff in 10 countries. I am not "hunting" myself, but 
rather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and business 
development. We are hoping to place some Eastern European engineers into a 
Houston company before long, but I am not expecting to have to go there for 
some time to come.

You may notice that I am sending this e-mail from a new address. I am trying to 
face out the old one, since it has caused me endless problems. So in future 
please use the new one: martin@heelas-joergensen.com (heelas being my wife's 
maiden name).

I am very pleased to hear that you are well, but would rather hope that you 
could find an excuse to come to London, even if your pipelines do not reach 
that far...


All the best,


Martin

Good morning:

I have returned from an amazing "vacation" in Hawaii and it is good to be
home.  I played a ton of golf (thanks to my friend Pritch) and even rested
some.

I am playing in the Houston City Amateur this Friday, Saturday and Sunday at
Memorial Park.  To my Houston friends, please feel free to come out to the
park if your weekend schedule permits and you want a bit of sun and
exercise.  I'm first off tomorrw at 7:45am and Saturday, I tee off at
12:15pm.

This was one of the last places Meredith and I were together the day she
died.  My brother, Ford, is coming in from Austin to caddy for me for this
tournament as well as a qualifier for the USGA Mid-Am on Monday at
Shadowhawk.  It promises to be a special weekend for me and for us.

I continue to walk through the pain and loneliness.  Each day seems to bring
new challenges, but I press on.  I am shocked and saddened by the events on
the east coast just like everyone, but we will be a stronger and more
compassionate nation going forward.  A most unfortunate event, I know there
are so many, many families now who can partially identify with my loss.

God bless you all.  I look forward to visiting with everyone in the coming
weeks and months.

Love,

Tim

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.  

Please click on the link below.

Subject: HABITAT
 
St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 



Welcome Habitat Volunteers! 

Our project starts on October 20, at 8 am.  Due to the overwhelming
response from our church community, it will be necessary to schedule
volunteers for particular Saturdays from October 20 through November 17.
We want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to
participate without overcrowding the building site.  If I have scheduled
you for a date you are unavailable, please let me know; there are plenty
of people to step in!  The schedule for October 20 is attached.  Others
will follow shortly. 

Please plan on providing your own lunch on October 20.  We will provide
drinks, but you should bring water for yourself. 

I have ordered tee shirts. If you want one, please advise me of your
size, small through extra large, in writing or e-mail.  The price is
$8.00, which will just cover our cost.  The shirts are gray with the
Habitat bent nail logo on the back and the St. Paul's logo on the front.
I will have them at the site. 

We will have hard hats at the site.  If you are scheduled to work and
have indicated that you have power tools, please confirm to me that you
will be able to bring those tools on your scheduled days.    

Noel Chang has volunteered to be the transportation coordinator.  He
will provide or arrange transportation on a church van or bus on each of
the Saturdays.  I have given him your name if you identified yourself to
me.  You can contact him at "changing@swbell.net" or 281-461-4709. 

We need volunteers for several other key positions.  If you are
qualified to be a first aid/safety manager, or would like to organize
food/water/beverage, daily registration, clean up or tool management,
please let me know. 

For additional information, contact me at: 713-748-3317; fax
713-741-6233; or email: lesliewmadams@aol.com. 

Peace and grace, 

Les

St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 





Welcome Habitat Volunteers! 

Our project starts on October 20, at 8 am.  Due to the overwhelming response from our church community, it will be necessary to schedule volunteers for particular Saturdays from October 20 through November 17. We want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to participate without overcrowding the building site.  If I have scheduled you for a date you are unavailable, please let me know; there are plenty of people to step in!  The schedule for October 20 is attached.  Others will follow shortly. 

Please plan on providing your own lunch on October 20.  We will provide drinks, but you should bring water for yourself. 

I have ordered tee shirts. If you want one, please advise me of your size, small through extra large, in writing or e-mail.  The price is $8.00, which will just cover our cost.  The shirts are gray with the Habitat bent nail logo on the back and the St. Paul's logo on the front.  I will have them at the site. 

We will have hard hats at the site.  If you are scheduled to work and have indicated that you have power tools, please confirm to me that you will be able to bring those tools on your scheduled days.    

Noel Chang has volunteered to be the transportation coordinator.  He will provide or arrange transportation on a church van or bus on each of the Saturdays.  I have given him your name if you identified yourself to me.  You can contact him at "changing@swbell.net" or 281-461-4709. 

We need volunteers for several other key positions.  If you are qualified to be a first aid/safety manager, or would like to organize food/water/beverage, daily registration, clean up or tool management, please let me know. 

For additional information, contact me at: 713-748-3317; fax 713-741-6233; or email: lesliewmadams@aol.com. 

Peace and grace, 

Les

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is "Mission: Possible" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

Mike McConnell

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Hi Mark, 
    I didn't name her, but "Kitty" from "Absolute Heavenly Massage" will  
come out to the house the evening of the third.  I will give her directions.   
Here is her number: 
(208) 255-7170 
She sounds legitimate, nothing "sleazy"    Call her and alert her as to what  
time you guesstimate your arrival. 
Thanks, 
Martina

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Michael,
 
We calculated 7% but at $750/acre (Terry seems to think there is no way
we can get if for less than that, and I voiced my opinion not to go
higher).  He said that they did mention owner financing late last week -
as low as 6% so maybe we could go higher on the per acre price.  We
didn't calculate hunting income or taxes - assuming roughly they would
cancel out.  Also, Terry indicates that the farm really wants half (not
sure if he needs to tie out with Daddy) - so that would leave us with
responsibility for 175 each.
 
I think the cropland base numbers are too high on your spread sheet.  If
you add the rice base, grain base and cropland base, you come up in
excess of the total acreage.  I can redo the sheet this afternoon.
 
The end result we had is that we would each be out of pocket
approximately $500/ month.  Mark and I are willing to do that.  Not sure
what you are thinking there.
 
Sarah

Sarah:
 
I've done some cash flow calculations on that land using the numbers
given to us by Daddy (assuming $725/ac and 7.25% financing).  Do they
agree with what you and Mark have come up with?  Have I left something
out?
 
My calculations indicate that if you can purchase for $700/ac and
finance at 7%, you break even with $61/ac rental on the rice base.  I
don't know if that is possible.
 
You can change the numbers in the worksheet and the calculations should
update to reflect the correct values.
 
Let me know what you think.
 
Michael

Kim,

Thanks.  

Also, I need a favor.  I need your top 3 or 4 articles on investing post
age 60.  My dad has a broker who has been moving his money in and out of
stocks, and I need to show him something in black and white that says
that is not the thing to do.  This strategy has not worked well for
anyone except the broker, of course.

Thanks in advance for your help.

University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. 
Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended 
on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team
by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth 
terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within 
the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT
campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

	Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

	713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Most of you have heard or seen pictures of strange crop formations in England.  Similar formations are now cropping up in Texas.  While flying over the Hlavinka family farm east Brookshire, Texas I spotted a strange crop formation in a rice field.  I believe this to be undistputed proof that there is intellegent life making strange crop formations.
 
Kenneth Hlavinka '90 and Brian Hlavinka '93 created this crop formation.  Originally the design was to be photographed from the dryers at the bottom of the photo, but an ariel shot of the formation makes for a nice view.

Sarah,

Try this when you get to work, it is creepy.  


Create a new doc with wordpad. 
Type "NYC" without the quotes and set the font to 30 or so... 
Highlight the letters with your mouse, Change the font to Webdings and see what you get. 
Then change the font to Wingdings and see what you get.

Hi Mark,
Thank you for your voice mail today and congratulations on your position with Transwestern. I'm sure we will have the opportunity to talk about some deals in the future.  We were in fact going after a large deal over the last several weeks.  We heard last week that we were runner up to a very strong bid from Duke's MLP, TEPCO.  Had we gotten it, we would have clearly needed additional commercial help.  I am now reassessing our needs. I did get a call today from Brian Kinsey and will follow-up with him.

Again, congratulations and I enjoyed our visit in Houston.


Brian

OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: July 26th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Many of the prospective employers who have been invited to the career fair have responded enthusiastically. They know that Enron hires good people and they are interested in meeting you. For those of you who have sent me a resume release form, your resumes have been forwarded to interested companies. To date, we have 12 companies that will be attending and are waiting to hear from others. Their deadline for responding is Friday afternoon.

In case you would like to participate and you have not sent a release form and a resume to me, please contact me at ext. 5-4364 or via e-mail.

If you plan to attend the career fair, please respond to me no later than noon on Friday, August 24 and provide me with your name as you wish it to appear on your name tag. 

Members of the Resource Management Team will be at the career fair to assist you with networking. As a reminder, you might want to consider wearing business attire as you would for an interview outside of Enron, and please bring extra copies of your resume. I look forward to seeing you there.

Joan Woodson

All:

My time at Enron is quickly coming to an end as this is my last week. I have enjoyed working with each of you and getting to know you over the years! 

I hope to keep in contact with many of you as I transition to a new phase in life...parenthood (advice welcomed)! For those of you who did not know, we are expecting our baby to arrive on October 17th. I plan to have a couple of months to prepare for this new adventure. Although I am sure that Baby Monk will take after his/her mother and love to travel, we decided that the commute from Dallas to Houston might be too much for him/her in the early years. It is with regret that I leave this great company. My current plan is to enjoy some time off and to begin looking for a position based in Dallas in the first quarter of 2002 (suggestions and referrals appreciated).

Please send me your contact information so we can stay in touch and keep me informed on all of the scoop! My contact information is as follows:

Dallas, Texas 75225

St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 

October 22, 2001 




My apologies to those of you that did not find the new site last Saturday.  The Habitat folks were supposed to have someone visit the Chickasaw site, but it appears that did not happen.   

Our family, the Franco's, were at the Tangiers site Saturday, dressed in our St.Paul's/Habitat tee shirts.  Fourteen year old Jose, Jr., was in the middle of the construction, cutting door openings with a Sawzall.  Imagine his pride in helping build his family's home. 

We (I) had a problem with mosquitos, ants and poison ivy last Saturday.  We will have lots of bug repellent and I will try to rope off the poison ivy.  If you have concerns, please see me at the registration table Saturday. 

Special thanks to Jeanie Koch for assembling a first aid kit and standing at the ready; to Mark McConnell for finding hard hats for our group; to Ken Jones for coffee, donuts, juice and soda to keep us fueled all day, and to all the workers who managed to complete the interior walls and to cap the exterior walls, and still get us out by 3:30!   

The new address is 10223 Tangiers.  This is about eight blocks from the old location but is somewhat simpler to get to.  Directions: Take Interstate 10 to the Gessner exit and head north.  Tangiers is approximately ? mile past Clay Road and is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

Alternate route: From Highway 290, take the 43rd Street exit and go west.  43rd Street turns into Clay Road.  Continue on Clay to Gessner.  Right on Gessner approximately ? mile to Tangiers, which is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

I have attached a schedule for the remaining weeks of the Project.  Please let me know if additional changes are needed. 

See you Saturday!

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Mark/Greg,

Attached is a detailed report on the status on completed performance reviews across EWS (excluding EEL - who had 95% of their completed by 7/31). In brief, here are the headlines:

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES					
 					
	Enron Americas	1078	432	40.1%	
	Enron Broadband Services, Inc	822	180	21.9%	
	Enron Canada Corp	107	38	35.5%	
	Enron Engineering & Operational Services	968	161	16.6%	
	Enron Global Markets	363	124	34.2%	
	Enron Industrial Markets	192	72	37.5%	
 	Enron Net Works	1560	680	43.6%	
	Enron Wholesale Services	13	1	7.7%	
	Wholesale EES	35	29	82.9%	
					
 	EWS - Consolidated	5138	1717	33.4%	


Our target was to have all evaluations completed by August 31 (we had hoped that all below VP's would be done by August 17). At year end we achieved close to 90% completion of written evaluations. The HR team are working hard to help their clients get these finalised, but I would appreciate all of your help in chasing this process to a successful conclusion.

 

David

Mark:  Greetings.  I'm glad to hear that you might make it to the Steve Couch Memorial Golf Tournament this Friday.  If you want to play, we have a place for you.  We will either put you with a team that needs a fourth, or simply put you on a foursome if other teams are filled.  I know that Brad Schick is in the same boat that your are, so I'm looking for a team for him also.  Whatever we do, we will find a place for you.  I hope you can get off work and join us.  Please let me know if Dial's team needs you or you find a spot on another team.  I look forward to seeing you Friday.   - Donnie

Subject: Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Mark,

I just wanted to say a BIG thank you for your recommendation of "This Century." It was truly the only thing separating me from insanity on our drive from Houston to LA. The stories were unbelievable! I want to buy the CD series someday and force everyone in my family to listen to it! I can't thank you enough for the suggestion! I've also thought about you several times as Will watched the OU games! (I watched a little too!!) I was absolutely sure that you were watching the very same thing at the very same moment. Am I right??

Anyway, Will and I love L.A. so far and are definately happy with the weather, our apartment and the life in general. I start work on Tuesday and it will be very interesting to see how it differs from Enron and whether those differences sit well with me or not. I'm sure your having quite and adjustment as well, being in a new group and hopefully one that is less tumultuous! I'd love to hear your experiences!

I also hope that you and Sara are doing well and still enjoying your house and all of the fun things about sharing it together .. I will miss hearing your stories . . .especially about how God is working in your life. It was pretty rare to talk about God with people at Enron and I am thankful that I met you and in you someone who shared the same foundation of faith. I truly wish you many blessings as you start this next phase of your career and hope we will keep in touch!

Sincerely,
Marissa

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Mark - Bill Brogan had told me the news about TW, and I think that will be a
great opportunity.  Waiting around for the vaunted Calpine Human Resources
machine to spring into action (note the sarcasm) is no fun, and something
this company is going to figure out the hard way.

Anyway, best of luck, both with your new role and to the Sooners going 14-0

Take a look at Jessie.  She is unbelievably cute.  Note that Cindy says
that: I've had Jessie
over a month now, she wagged her tail for the first time last
week. 

Poor little Jessie.

Hi Everyone,
I just returned from Montgomery.  While there, I attended the
WTCA dinner/meeting.    
TX WAG was awarded a very nice plaque, in appreciation, from WTCARES.
You can read a little blurb about it on the web site:
http://www.wtcares.org/

While you are there, take a look at Jessie.  She is a 6 y/o female
I am fostering right now.  I'm looking for someone with terrier 
experience for Jessie.  No kids, no other pets.  I've had Jessie
over a month now, she wagged her tail for the first time last
week.  If any of y'all know someone that might be interested, ask
them to contact me!

And, about the plaque; don't y'all think Jeff and Gigi should have
the plaque?  Since it's always their digs where we WAG?  
Cindy

All:

Today is my last day at Enron, so I wanted to wish you all well.  I've truly enjoyed working for Enron, and have been given some wonderful opportunities.

Ann, Jacob and I will be moving back to Denver, CO next week and starting the next chapter of our lives, as well as figuring out what the next step in my career will be.

I can be reached on my personal e-mail: a_a_maus@yahoo.com

Take care and best wishes,

Andy

Hi Mark, 
    Directions from I-90.....coming from Montana 
When you get to the Coeur d' Alene vicinity in Idaho, you will take  
EXIT 12- Hwy 95 Sandpoint /Moscow. 
Turn right, which will head you North on Hwy 95 towards Sandpoint.   I can  
either meet you, ( I am 1/3 on the way) or you can drive about 41 - 41.8   
miles......there will be a flashing yellow light on the right hand side of  
the road  and a "Greenwood St" sign (kind of far in on the right.  ) It is  
right before the parking lot for the "Long Bridge Grill"  you turn right on  
Greenwood.   
(If you have gone over the long bridge over the lake, you have gone too far)  
Drive to the first and only street.  (No sign, you cannot miss it)  turn  
right.  It is the 2nd house on the left....26 Harbor View.  I will leave the  
key under the door mat for you.  If you like, I will meet you, or you can  
follow me up.....or not. 
I am awaiting confirmation of availability from 1 or 2 masseuses.  I will get  
you the number of the one who can do it. 
Any questions you think of, let me know. 
I'll be in touch. 
Martina (877)890-2444 
P.S.  the last guest left my number a directions at home....don't forget them.

Mark,
 
I just wanted to say a BIG thank you for your recommendation of "This Century." It was truly the only thing separating me from insanity on our drive from Houston to LA. The stories were unbelievable! I want to buy the CD series someday and force everyone in my family to listen to it! I can't thank you enough for the suggestion! I've also thought about you several times as Will watched the OU games! (I watched a little too!!) I was absolutely sure that you were watching the very same thing at the very same moment. Am I right??
 
Anyway, Will and I love L.A. so far and are definately happy with the weather, our apartment and the life in general. I start work on Tuesday and it will be very interesting to see how it differs from Enron and whether those differences sit well with me or not. I'm sure your having quite and adjustment as well, being in a new group and hopefully one that is less tumultuous! I'd love to hear your experiences!
 
I also hope that you and Sara are doing well and still enjoying your house and all of the fun things about sharing it together .. I will miss hearing your stories . . .especially about how God is working in your life. It was pretty rare to talk about God with people at Enron and I am thankful that I met you and in you someone who shared the same foundation of faith. I truly wish you many blessings as you start this next phase of your career and hope we will keep in touch!
 
Sincerely,
Marissa

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.

	Meredith passed away Saturday evening due to trauma suffered from a

	Tim wants everyone to know that Meredith had gone outside to
experience
	God's creation and to enjoy the sounds of the passing thunderstorm.

obituary
	Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

	The funeral will be Wednesday at 12:00 noon at Houston's First
Presbyterian
	church at the corner of Bissonnet and Main street across from the
Museum of
	Fine Arts.

	In lieu of flowers, the family is asking that donations be made to
the
	Leukemia Society.

	Please inform those of Tim and Meredith's friends that may not have
heard.

	Thank you and God Bless,
	George and Christie Thomas

Thank you all for your willingness to serve on our Habitat project.  All of you were chosen for some leadership position because of your skill and experience.   

The biggest challenge with this project is the number of people who want to participate.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to complete the house, probably ahead of schedule, with this much manpower, so long as Habitat has the supplies on hand.  From our standpoint, the purpose of the project is as much ministry and fellowship as the end product, which is why we didn't turn any volunteers away.   

I encourage each of you to participate on as many Saturdays as possible.  We will need some continuity in leadership since so many volunteers will be participating for only one or two Saturdays, and that may be a month apart.  At the same time, there are enough leaders that you shouldn't feel guilty if you have other obligations.  When you are available, you will be instrumental in keeping people organized, safe and productive. 

Thank you again. 

Les

Hi Mark!
 How are things in Texas? Hope everything is going well. I am in LA
these days, and hopefully will be settled here soon. I've been looking
into a few positions at different studios, including Sony, Fox, Disney,
Paramount, and Universal. I would love to get some contacts so I can
send my resume directly to people in development, marketing, or
promotions, and I was hoping that you would be able to give me a few
names. I understand you are looking for a new job too. Best of luck! I
still think you should become a dance instructor though :)  Let me know
how it goes. 
Take care and I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks!

Stephanie

St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 




The site for the construction of the Habitat house has changed!  Because of additional delays in pouring the concrete walls, our family, the Franco's, will take over another site where the walls have already been poured. 

The new address is 10223 Tangiers.  This is about eight blocks from the old location but is somewhat simpler to get to.  Directions: From Highway 290, take the 43rd Street exit and go west.  43rd Street turns into Clay Road.  Continue on Clay to Gessner.  Right on Gessner approximately ? mile to Tangiers, which is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

Alternate route: Take Interstate 10 to the Gessner exit and head north.  Tangiers is approximately ? mile past Clay Road and is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

There is another Habitat home under construction on the site next to ours so the area will be crowded.  Parking will be tighter than the previous site, so car pool or take the van from the church if you can.  The site will need straightening before we can start constructing the interior walls.  Make sure you have heavy duty gloves.  We will also be staining the concrete walls.  The home next door has already been stained and it really looks like a brick home! 

There are plenty of fast food places on Gessner within 5-10 minutes of the site for those who want to get away for lunch. We will have coffee and donuts waiting for everyone Saturday morning. 

The tee shirts are in and look great.  They will be at the site Saturday. 

I have attached a schedule for all five weeks of the Project.  Please let me know if additional changes are needed by return email or 713-748-3317. 

See you Saturday!

FYI, per our meeting with Ben and Kim, here is the access to the Deal Profitibility system.  The dashboard just went down, I'm trying to verify that we still have access via the dashboard.

Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be
open.  I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.

Mark, I reviewed the resumes and I was in error regarding the same line in another resume... infact, you are correct, international is only under your name. 

I went back and checked last night and wanted to get back to you.... thanks.
