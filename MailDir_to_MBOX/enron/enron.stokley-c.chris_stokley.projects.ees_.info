Murray,

Over the past two weeks I have been engaged in the same activitiy you describe - trying to get included on ditribution lists and brought into the loop.  I am involved in the Project Management office of Project Gutenberg (as of Monday), and I am atending Project Ranger meetings.  I have a full copy of the CSC and AVISTA agreements.  I think that is about the extent currently.  Sounds like you have the data around Gutenberg.  Project Ranger is a tactical initiative led by Robert Bailey in Evan Hughes organization that is intended to be a Repository for actual settlement data.  I have committed to Beth that I would set up a status meeting with Robert to summarize the initiative, status, deliverables and timeline.  I will include you and Chris in that meeting.  It will probably be the week of 7/9.

I have attached Paige's listing of issues.  This is from the Gutenberg perspective as that is Paige's full-time focus.  Hope it helps.  I don't be leive you would be interested in the CSC or AVISTA agreements, but if you are, let me know.  I have only hard copies, and the AVISTA agreement is manageable in size.  However, the CSC agreement is very large.  Either you are Chris are welcome to stop by and look at it when you have time.

Just on another note, can you help me better understand the role you and Chris are playing?  It will help me better understand how we will need to interact and how I can help you all better, or even more, how you all can help me!!  Look forward to working with you both.

I will be out of the office next week (I felt I better get in a few days off before my role really cranks up!), but let me know when you all are back in Houston.  We will have to plan lunch, or drinks and dinner.  Take care, and have a great 4th!

Brenda,

Yesterday, 6/27/01 when we were in the meeting with Jay Lewis, you had a document which I believe contained a list of all of the issues to date.  I think you referenced the document as being something which was put together by Paige Grgrumulaitis.  Can you please forward myself & Chris Stokley a copy of that document.

In addition, it would be beneficial to these efforts if you could add us to any distribution lists which have already been established or will be established in the future  for scheduling meetings, distributing communications?  

It would be helpful if you could provide us with any documentation which we may have been previously distributed. We are looking for any documentation that references process and / or systems for EES current or future state.
I currently have two documents from the Gutenberg team:  
 1 - ("Gutenberg "Is" and "Should" cross-functional process maps")
 2 - ("Gutenberg Calculation Engine Project - Phase I) dated May 25, 2001.  

There are many activities currently underway in this transition, and I am making these requests in hopes that we can prevent people from trying to reinvent the wheel or performing redundant activities.  

Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks - MO

Here are a few of the issues that I am aware of and trying to get resolved:

- Some of the larger retail deals do not show up as retail because they were booked as "wholesale" equivalents.  Due to the complexity of the deals and number of batches, it is my understanding that it will take a while before these deals get booked properly given current resource availability.

- There are several counterparties and /or batches that show up on the reports as "?".  This is a naming convention issue which I don't believe will take too long to resolve.

- NP-15 and SP-15 have several positions showing as direct access that should not be (ie Seagate, Lyons Magnus, Unisil, Starwood).  I have followed up on this but not received a response yet.

- Many of our index priced deals show up in our positions without any designation that they are financial positions.  RPS does not currently have the capability to differentiate between physical and financial.

There are also several issues relating to CTC dates and transition periods relating to other regions.  Chris Leonard and I are going to talk about this today and figure out who we need to follow up with.

Here is a tentative list of pass through items that Chris Stokley and I came up with.  Please let Chris or me know if you have any other suggestions.  Thanks!

Pass through pricing:

T&D
ICAP
Ancillary's (need 4 columns for future expansion)
Congestion
Line Losses
Green (this is for renewable requirements)
5 or so extra columns just in case we think of anything else

Is EPMI involved with the APX also ?  They do not indicate a time line here but I assume they are talking about the end of last year/early this year. 
Let me know if we need to be more involved in this process.
