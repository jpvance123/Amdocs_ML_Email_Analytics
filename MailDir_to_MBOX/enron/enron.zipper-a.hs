The attached reflects the changes to paragraph 2 to clarify the $250,000 payment (I have included a marked version to show the change as well as a clean version).  Upon receipt of HoustonStreet's signature pages, I will send by fax and fedex our signature pages to the letter agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement.

Per the conversation between Andy and Frank, the paragraphs regarding the
issuance of the 763,305 shares at the time of the Interface Completion Date
have been removed.  Therefore, we are reverting back to the last draft of
the Letter Agreement, sent by Travis, on 3/28 and hereby attached.

I have accepted the changes and have attached a clean version of the
document.  This will be executed by Frank after the Board meeting and we
will fax a copy to you immediately thereafter.  Please be prepared to sign
the letter agreement at that time so that we can proceed with the wire
transfer of Series C monies.

Best Regards,

Derek Gamble

Gentlemen:

Per my voicemail to Doug Dunn and Derek Gamble, I am attaching a revised
letter agreement addressing the issuance of the volume-based shares.  It
was our understanding that these would be issued to us as well as the
warrant shares, but we discovered that it was not covered by the agreement.

This draft is marked against the draft circulated last night.   Please call
if you have any questions.

I just talked to Houston Street and they say they are ready to begin testing gas.  Linda indicated that she had sent passwords for their gas test site.  She did request that we notify her prior to logging in so that they can make sure the test environment is stable.

Bob,
Here are the details for the fills.  We actually cleaned out the database
just prior to 3:00 PM CST yesterday in preperation for the testing.  If you
could reconcile based ont he first deal datetime and count from their
forward that would be great.

Here are the details.

user		Fills

First fill datetime stamp to start counting from : 5-22-2001 14:58:31.440
CST.

If you could count forward from that point we should be in sync.

Thanks,  Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again for taking the time yesterday to go over the latest version of
the application.  Flight back was a bit long - got into Boston at 1 AM and
didn't get home til 2:30 AM...

Andy,

As I mentioned during our call on Friday, HoustonStreet is doing a $4mm
round of debt financing with warrants allowing the holders to convert the
debt into equity at $.15 per share.  An additional approximately $8mm of
outstanding indebtedness is also being converted into the same security.
The following is the information you requested to analyze Enron's postion:

1.  Enron currently owns 8.16% of HoustonStreet;
2.  Enron will be granted three additional blocks of 254,400 shares each
based upon achieving agreed upon volume targets;
3.  Enron will receive an additional 10% of HoustonStreet (on a fully
diluted basis) if the link with HoustonStreet is exclusive after one year
from going live;
4.  If Enron does not participate in this round of financing, it would own
approximatley 2%.  The shares awarded for volume targets and exclusivity
(points 2 and 3 above) remain unchanged;
5.  Enron's pro rata share of the $4mm of new capital is $343k.  If Enron
invested $343k, it would own 4% after the financing; and
6.  Enron's pro rata share of the $12mm financing ($4mm of new capital and
$8mm of debt conversion) is approximately $1mm.  If Enron invested $1mm, it
would own 8.6% after the financing.

I hope this provides you with the information you need.  Please feel free to
contact me if you have any questions.  The closing for this round of
financing is scheduled for March 12, 2001.

Best regards,
Frank

John Applegate called and want to formalize the scope changes that may have occured wince the deal was signed.  They feel that we have relaxed the time frame for completion of the interface that enables us to propose transactions to their platform that then invokes the Enron Transaction Interface.  I would like to know what you know about this.

Andy,

As you might expect in this market environment, valuations are down
significantly from our last round.  I expect we'll be south of $50mm.  We've
slashed our expenses so we won't have to take as much $$ at such a low
valuation.  We only need $5mm to $10mm to get us through to the other side.
At these prices, I expect certain of our existing shareholders to step up.
Just as there was a disconnection between underlying fundamentals and
valuations in the first half of 2000, I feel like there is now a disconnect
on the downside.  Operationally, we're ahead of plan and looking at
profitablity in the third quarter, but most VCs are licking their wounds and
frozen.  They are a bunch of lemmings.  I won't have specific dilution
figures until we firm up the round.  Obviously, I want to sell as little of
the company as possible in this market.  I'll keep you posted.

I'm also working on a proposal on the global strategy I mentioned to you and
Louise in our meeting.  Will have something to share with you in early Feb.

Please keep all this confidential.  I'm headed to Europe later this
afternoon, but will be back on Wednesday if you want to talk.

Best regards,
Frank

For reference, what value does the round of financing you are working on
place on HoustonStreet and how much dilution do you anticipate ?

Andy,

Another point to note is that 50% of the funding occurs at closing and 50%
after our link with EOL is up and running for 30 days, so all the funding is
not required at closing.  I understand Enron will probably not invest, but I
wanted to make sure you had all the info.

Louise,

Congrats on the new baby!  Babies are truly a miracle.  Best of luck with
it.  I hope you saw all the movies that you wanted prior to delivery,
because it will be years before you see the inside of a movie theatre.

I know you are on maternity leave, but if you happen to get this email,
please give me a call.  Unfortunately, we are headed down a path right now
that could get very messy between HoustonStreet and Enron.  I want to avoid
that if at all possible.  There has been a level of frustration in the
communication and cooperation between our teams.  If we could both sides to
cooperate and focus for a couple of days, I am confident we can iron out any
issues and be prepared to go live within a week.

We have a number of big players that are eagerly awaiting the launch of our
link because they want to trade with Enron in a neutral, third party
environment.  I also know for a fact that there are back office integration
opportunities that we can pursue together that would be difficult for Enron
to pursue alone.

Congratulations again on your new child.

Best regards,
Frank

Linda:

FYI, I spoke with Bob Shults this afternoon.  We set up a meeting for Monday
morning, 9:00 EST.  Our objectives are to finalize a testing schedule for
the week, discuss the business questions we emailed Bob on Thursday, and
develop specific metrics to define when we are ready for "go live" from
Enron's standpoint.

Andy, 

Testing process began approx Feb 7th after the link was in:
They are able to login, get an weblogic session id, Request Prices, I have yet to see a Post Price request or Attempt Transaction.
Basically they are testing on receiving data back from us from their browser or their scripted programs.


One issue on going is making a connection to their server, which would cause an issue on Posting prices to their server.   We just received their server connection info (IP address, ports etc..) yesterday, thus we should be able to post prices to them once we complete our setup today.

 The product control group was very responsive with regards to answering business questions from Linda Bradley@Houstonstreet. 

If you need more detail let me know.  Hope this helps.

On May 22, 2001 HoustonStreet representatives (Frank Getman, John Wyman and David Cuadros) came to Enron to give us a demonstration of the gas interfaces.  HoustonStreet was allowed to load the required .cab files on the demonstration computers prior to the demonstration.  HoustonStreet provided us with a script to follow relative to the demonstration as well as a list of test and production mappings.  During the demonstration we experienced the following:

1 - 8 second delays between a price update on EnronOnline and a price update on HoustonStreet.  With just five products active we experienced a delay of up to 5 seconds.  Due to the delay in price updates, transaction attempts on the HoustonStreet platform resulted in a high percentage of failed transactions with Enron.
When we activated Product ID 16612 (US Gas Basis PEPL Jun-Oct01) the product showed up on EnronOnline but did not show up on HoustonStreet.  HoustonStreet provided us with a list of products which had been mapped in the test environment and this product was included on the list.  HoustonStreet indicated that they had verified the mapping of all the products on this list.  We reviewed the mapping of this product by Enron and confirmed that it was active and mapped.  Incorrect mapping of products has the potential of allowing transactions to occur with mismatched product types.
When we attempted to transact on Product ID 16600 (US Gas Basis NGI Chicago Jun-Oct01) we were unable to complete a transaction even when the bid and offer prices were not changing.  These transaction attempts should have resulted in successful transactions.  We also experience instances where the bid and/or offer price would disappear after a failed transaction attempt and not reappear even thought the price was still present on EnronOnline.  In many cases the price would disappear for up to 30 seconds or more.  Although we did not witness any incorrect transactions, general functionality failure may or may not result in incorrect transactions.  At a minimum this type of behavior would result in frustration on the part of the counterparty when a transaction attempt results in a failure with no subsequent price move or a disappearing price.
A review of the transactions we recorded versus the transactions indicated by HoustonStreet reveals some discrepancies.  In an email from John Wyman dated 5/23 (forwarded seperately), John Wyman indicated that they had cleaned their database just prior to 3:00 PM and gave us just the trade count beginning at 14:58 on 5/22.  Although there has not been a deal by deal reconciliation of the trades, we compared our total trade count beginning at 14:58.  If the deal counts do not match this would result in substantial financial exposure.  Below I have highlighted the HoustonStreet transactions by counterparty versus the EnronOnline transaction count:

			HSE	EOL

	Arizona		 12	 14
	Avista		 03	 03
	Adams		 17	 19
	BP		 57	 58
	
	Total		 89	 94
	
Based upon my review of the demonstration, I continue to believe there significant potential exposure associated with the HoustonStreet interfaces.

Just got off a call with Linda Bradley.  She advised everything is going good, they are still working their interface and working out the bugs when receiving our data and feeding it into their database.  She advised everything is going well, they were out part of last week because of the snow storm up there but they are back at it.  I advised her to contact me if there are any problems with our connections.
 
Also, to my understanding there is a conference call this afternoon, approx 2pm cst with the business people.

Bob,
It appears that we may have had some confusion around the completed
transactions that were recorded on Houston Street during our demonstration
on Tuesday, May 22nd.  Since we have been unable to verify the timeframes
used, we have extracted from our database all of the transactions that
occurred after 2:45 Central Time through 5:30 Central Time.  We used our
DealCapture Product which enables customers to extract their deals done from
our database.  We are also providing a detailed log containing all of the
transaction responses that we received from Enron that resulting in a FILLED
transaction.  By expanding this timeframe we have the following Trade
Confirmation Details which is confirmed by the FILLED Transaction log and
the DealCapture XML that was generated.

Bob:

It was nice talking to you today.  I wanted to pass along Derek's contact
information and vice versa.  Derek will be sending you our trading agreement
shortly, per your request.  Please note that the version we are using does
not differ materially from the version Enron reviewed during 4Q 2000.  Derek
Gamble is thoroughly familiar with our trading agreements and will be able
to answer any questions you may have for HoustonStreet.  Please do not
hesitate to contact me directly though, if I can be of any assistance.  As I
mentioned during our call, Enron is my top priority.

John

Andy,

As we discussed at our last meeting, I attach for your review a proposal to
expand the link between EnronOnline and HoustonStreet on a global basis.  I
think the proposal makes a lot of sense when entering new global markets.
If you have time, I would like to discuss this proposal and our current
round of financing at HoustonStreet tomorrow afternoon.  Are you available
tomorrow afternoon to talk?  Any time is good with me.

Best regards,
Frank

Bob,
I just wanted to follow-up on mapping from yesterday.

Test ID mapping - Sevita was highlighting the products that potentially were
not mapping correctly.  Could you fax this sheet with the hilighting so we
can investigate further.  Also, we have gotton several updates on the
Production ID's for mapping purposes, but have not had any updates for the
Test ID since Jan/Feb timeframe.  We noticed that some of the products get
new id's each month and this may be a contributing factor to the mapping
since we don't have a recent update for test id's.

I am hopeful in that we may be able to move forward and again appreciate you
and your team taking the time to work with us yesterday during the
demonstration.

Please give me a call when you get a chance either at 603-766-8730 or on my
cell 603-591-9004.

Thanks again,

John Wyman

Andy,

When we met a few weeks back you offered to put me in touch with someone
from your VC group to discuss potential investors in HoustonStreet.  This
round of financing seems to be firming up at a very attractive price for new
investors and I wanted to take you up on your offer.  I'd love to talk with
someone in your VC group about who they see in the market that is actually
taking positions at this time.  We may have room to fill in this round with
some new investors.  Someone's going to make a lot of money on
HoustonStreet.

I received a briefing Friday on our development efforts and things seem to
be on track.  We have brought in some unbelievable developers that are very
focused and enjoying this project immensely.  Please let me know if any
issues come up with development efforts from your end and I'll do the same.

Best regards,
Frank

I would like to draft language to address the Prebon comments from today give it to them.  Based upon their actions I might want you to give Graham Huggins a call to remind him about our long lasting relationship.

Pursuant to the HoustonStreet Price Posting Agreement and subsequent amendment, the companies have conducted extensive Interface testing.  The testing has been an iterative process over several weeks and has included both stress testing and unit testing.  The testing was conducted to ensure interface functionality and load performance.

On May 7 - 8, 2001 we tested with HoustonStreet to determine whether the Sponsor Interface Acceptance Criteria had been met.  Based upon the following results I do not believe that all the criteria have been met and recommend against putting the Interfaces into production.

1.  Although the Sponsor was able to accept continuous price updates we experienced a 1 - 8 second time variance between price updates on EnronOnline and price updates on HoustonStreet.   Testing periods of up to 1.5 hours were included in the testing.  Price updates during the testing ranged from 20 - 40 updates per second with peaks of approximately 60 updates per second.  The 1 - 8 second delay on the HoustonStreet website will result in a high percentage of failed transactions with Enron.

2.  No testing was done at 100 -200 updates per second.  

3. HoustonStreet was unable to do a three day uninterrupted period to allow for testing.  As a result of incidents seen in the testing on May 8, 2001, HoustonStreet was still making adjustments to software as evidenced by the May 11, 2001 email from John Whyman of HoustonStreet.  Without a three day "quiet" period we are unable to finish testing the functionality of the interfaces.  Until such time as the software and hardware are locked down, we cannot be assured that changes that are being made are not impacting the results of previous testing.  Essentially without a lock down period we could not be sure that any functionality would work when we went live.

4. HoustonStreet did provide an excel matrix for displaying the Enron product descriptions.  Enron requested that the matrix be prominently displayed on the Sponsor Platform.  We were unable to view the matrix on the Sponsor Platform.   If the matrix was not prominently displayed on the HoustonStreet website, customers transacting on HoustonStreet may actually buy or sell a product that is different than they thought.  The matrix was required to ensure that anyone transacting with Enron would know exactly what product they were dealing with based upon the EnronOnline short description.

5. Functionality testing could not be completed due to the inability to do a three-day uninterrupted test as required in number 3 above.  As long as changes to the software and hardware continued Enron can not be assured that changes would not impact system functionality.  We had planned to do a test of all functionality during the three-day quiet period.  Testing of system functionality that was conducted on May 7 - 8 revealed the following critical issues:

We saw incidents of incorrect Enron price updates posting on the Sponsor Platform.  One specific examples included a crossed market display with a bid price of $6.00+ and an offer price <$1.00
We experienced instances of both successful and failed transaction messaging that were delayed anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes.
We experienced successful transactions with Enron with no corresponding responses back to the Sponsor Platform.
We experienced instances where price updates were causing products to appear and disappear.  HoustonStreet indicated that the issue was the result of incorrect mapping.

Given the functionality problems we witnessed, a disconnect between Enron and the customer as to what transactions have been entered into would occur.  This disconnect would result in substantial price exposure during the period that the trade is not confirmed.  In addition, given the timing of the confirmations (positive and negative) a customer might be confused as to which confirmation was associated with which transaction attempt.  This situation once again would result in exposure from price movements in the markets.

Andy,

Below is an email with the current status of our project.  As I mentioned in
my voicemail, we were surprised by the performance of the system on Tuesday.
When we tried to replicate Tuesday's test results, we realized that Enron's
test environment had been using an older version of the software.  As you
will also note below, we have used this time to make performance
improvements and change the "Error" message per your suggestion.  If you
have a chance, please take a look at the current version.  I think it
addresses the concerns your team had on Tuesday.

Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Best regards,
Frank

Bob,
We have some good news regarding our client and testing that we uncovered
yesterday.

On Tuesday , during our testing with Enron we were unable to duplicate or
see some of the issues that John Applegate et al were describing and seeing
which concerned me.  We have been working very hard to try to see why this
was happening.

We uncovered 2 things:
1)  When a client application leaves the blue window open that indicates
that the bid or offer is not available, the client stops processing messages
which will cause the client to fall behind.  If this window is left open for
10 seconds, goes away for 2 seconds and is displayed again for 10 seconds,
the client will have fallen behind 18 seconds and took 25 seconds to catch
up.  This is a cumulative issue in that the more times this window is
displayed, the client is consistently falling farther and farther behind
which would explain why after 45 minutes of testing it took 5 minutes to
catch up and display all of the bid or offer not available warning and
confirmations.  We have addressed this problem and are currently testing it
into the evening to ensure that when this window is presented to the user,
the client continues to process updates without causing any backlog.
Included with this correction the label has been changed from ERROR to
WARNING, since this really isn't an error condition.

2)  The second item is related to inconsistent performance and numbers not
updating on the screen, but when the number is selected it updated to the
correct number.  After trying to recreate this problem on numerous machines,
we finally saw the scenario.  It is the result of an older version of the
software running on that machine.  This was verified by running the older
version of the software on multiple machines which resulted in inconsistent
performance and behavior from the client application.    To resolve this
issue, we are in the process of building a new release of the client
application that updates all of the version numbers on the software so that
a new cab download will be triggered which will automatically update all of
the required files on the Client.  This process will ensure that all of the
clients that we are using for testing have the latest version of the
software.  In order for the client to download and install the latest .cab
file, the user will require Administrative Privileges on the computer
installing the new software.

In Summary :
A) It appears that we were testing with different versions of the client
software.
B) We found a problem that resulted in the client falling behind.
C) We have corrected this problem and have been testing for the last several
hours.
D) We changed the wording of the Error Window to indicate a Warning.

Given this information we would like to schedule another test with you later
today, ensuring that we all have the latest software, so that we can all
feel confident that we have evaluated the correct version.

In our testing we have been hitting the software simulating enron updates
and continuous transaction attempts for 45 minutes to and hour with 8
clients.  The performance times between the transaction request and the fill
or fail message remained consistent across all of the clients at 3-5
seconds.

Please feel free to call me @ 603-766-8730 or John Applegate 713-590-5123..

Andy,

I understand the demonstration of the system is scheduled for tomorrow
(Tues) afternoon at 2pm Central in your offices.  If you have a few minutes
to stop by and bang on the system that would be great.  We would love to get
another trader's perspective.

Regards,
Frank

John,

As a follow up to our conversations this week and the testing that has been done, I wanted to outline our view of the current status:

Testing/Performance:  To date Houston Street has not met the minimum technical standards that were outlined in our discussion on Monday.  As we explained, Houston Street must be able to handle a continuous price update standard of 20 - 30 updates per second and a peak price update standard of 100 - 200 updates per second.  During our testing yesterday we experienced fatal errors on several occasions when sending continuous price updates.  It appears that we are not receiving responses to our updates in a timely manner and therefore are timing out the connection to maintain the operational integrity of our system.  We estimate that each bundle of messages (20 - 40 updates per bundle) sent to Houston Street was taking around 3 seconds to process.  Given the test performance to date is not acceptable we do not believe the interfaces are ready to go live at this point.

Legal:  Enron has requested that Houston Street incorporate the EnronOnline short descriptions as product identifiers on the Houston Street site.  Enron has requested that Houston Street have each customer wishing to transact with Enron acknowledge that they are transacting under the same terms and conditions as they would transact under on EnronOnline.  Houston Street will warrant that no customer will transact with Enron without acknowledging such.  Houston Street will determine whether acknowledgement will occur on the web site or in the trading agreement or both.  Enron has forwarded its comments on the Houston Street Trading Agreement for review by Houston Street.

I will contact you later today to discuss what the next course of action is.  Thanks.
