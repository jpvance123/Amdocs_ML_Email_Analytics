 NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM  Trent Green , QB KC - Figh=
tin Farmers Updated 10/18/01 Green should move the ball with ease against t=
he Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numb=
ers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilg=
er is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't ex=
pect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  M=
arcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as=
 Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor i=
n the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND =
- The Dyno-mite Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in=
 his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers o=
n James' home turf this week!   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated =
10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon f=
or the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put h=
im in your Fantasy lineup.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Swamis Stallions Upd=
ated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and ha=
s burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers=
 against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/=
18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He =
was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better agai=
nst them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/18=
/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right an=
kle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Gree=
n Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether=
 he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fightin Farmers Updated=
 10/18/01  Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is =
receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before=
 deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - The Dyno-mit=
e Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapol=
is' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an =
early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Th=
e Dyno-mite Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the firs=
t time he faced the Colts this year. Expect h! im! to get in the end zone a=
t least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chr=
ebet , WR NYJ - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very =
disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a sho=
otout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will cente=
r its gameplan around Curtis Martin.  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Atta=
ck Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but=
 might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be abl=
e to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin  , RB NYJ - Sack Attack Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this we=
ek. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.  =
 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his fir=
st decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a ver=
y risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolin=
a is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants=
 consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks w=
as very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes=
 for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even wort=
h a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - W=
idowMakers Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this seas=
on, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some succe=
ss against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in =
deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/18/01 =
Testaverde might not be a g! oo! d start this week. The St. Louis defense c=
an be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first i=
nterception of the year.   Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18=
/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Al=
exander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this =
point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could h=
ave a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's=
 worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.  =
 Torry Holt , WR STL - Terminators Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential =
to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a b=
ig time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly b=
asis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Mud Dogz Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been =
very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benchi=
ng. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets s=
econdary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell ha=
s become a decent tight end from a Fantasy ! pe! rspective this season. He'=
s worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight e=
nd on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 =
Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back thi=
s weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offen=
se and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kur=
t Warner , QB STL - Sack Attack Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbe=
rs he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. H=
e'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure =
to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Okie Pride Updated =
10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he g=
ets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach A=
ndy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likel=
y be the more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Mud =
Dogz Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the leagu=
e, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for t=
wo scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into =
your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pinksto=
n is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. =
He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at=
 this point.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/18/01=
 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial colla=
teral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will m=
iss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28=
, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Widow=
Makers Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid=
 Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league'=
s top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.  =

Featured Project
How to Patch Chipped and Pitted Concrete[IMAGE] Every spring, the effects of the past winter's freeze show up in the form of new cracks and chips in your concrete driveways and walkways. If you have an older property, the damage can get pretty ugly, but you don't always need to call in a professional to deal with it. As hard a material as concrete is, with the right tools and a little bit of know-how, it isn't that difficult to work with and repair. Check out this thorough  guide  from American Handyman magazine for the lowdown on how to shape up your concrete without breaking the bank.

Do-It-Yourself Tip 
[IMAGE]A new patch in an old concrete driveway or sidewalk can really stick out like a sore thumb. Getting a good finish match just takes a little patience and a soft-bristled push broom. After you've poured the concrete in the patch hole and worked the surface smooth with a wood float, wait around as it dries (this is the part that requires patience). When the new patch has hardened enough so that it's tough to put a dent in the surface with your finger, spray a fine mist of water over the top and gently scrub away the surface cream with your soft broom until the aggregate appears. If the old concrete shows larger aggregate, you'll have to scrub harder to match it. To take the fresh white color out of your patch, trying washing the surface with a little cola after it has hardened for a day. Odd as it sounds, the acidic nature of the soft drink often does the trick.

Subject:	Unify Exception List

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!

As a follow-up to the Enron Net Works All Employee meeting on October 5, we are pleased to announce a number of organizational changes.

Beth Perlman, currently CIO for EA Systems, will work closely with Mark Pickering on a number of key projects for Enron Net Works.  Additionally, Beth plans to explore various commercial opportunities within Enron.  Replacing Beth in her current role will be Steve Hotte, currently CIO for EGS.

Anthony Dayao will continue as CIO for EES Systems.  In addition to his current responsibilities, Anthony will assume responsibility for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system.
 
Jeff Johnson will move into the new role of CIO for EGM/EIM Systems.
 
John Paskin will transfer to the Houston office from London to take up the new role of CIO for Corporate Systems. His group will include the ISC, Enterprise Portal, Intranet Solutions, CRM strategy, Treasury Systems, Development Support and will matrix into HR IT Systems.
 
Continuing in their current positions are Inja Chun, CIO for EBS Systems; Paul Freeman, CIO for Enron Europe; Jay Webb, CIO for eCommerce, which now includes Commodity Logic Systems; and Jenny Rub, CIO for Infrastructure.

All of the above positions report into to Mark Pickering in the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.  Transitions into their new positions will begin within the next two weeks and should be complete by the end of the year.
 
We are currently interviewing individuals to serve as CIO for EGS, as well as an individual to serve as head of our Enterprise Framework group.  We will keep you posted on the progress of these searches.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new responsibilities.

Hello again.  Thanks to those of you that have RSVP'd for our event.  If you
haven't and you would like to attend, please let us know.  We would love to
have you join us!

After what had already been a difficult year for you as an investor, the
tragic September 11 events only added to our concern for financial recovery.
While we certainly can't control events around us and the impact they have
on our investments, it is still important to remember that we must look past
short-term effects on the markets and think of our long-term goals.

We would like to invite you to join us for an evening out to talk candidly
about how we all must feel right now, the current market conditions, and
steps that we need to take to help us reach our financial goals.

We will address The Three E's - Emotions, Expectations and Economics:

? How to cope with investment emotions
? Education on asset allocation
? Education on long-term investing

Please join us for our Market Outlook Seminar, to be held on Tuesday October
30th from 6:30 to 7:45 at Romano's Macaroni Grill at 1155 Lake Woodlands
Drive in The Woodlands.  We encourage you to bring a guest - in fact, we
will have drawings for some free giveaways for clients that bring guests!

You will have the opportunity to hear Allen Kuhn, Regional Vice President of
Franklin Templeton Investments, discuss the current market and what you need
to be aware of for the future.  Also, we have a new assistant for you to
meet, Karen.  Karen came to work with us last October.  Some of you may have
already had an opportunity to talk with her.

Call Kathy at 281.367.8658 ext. 2234 soon to make your reservations, since
seats are limited. I look forward to seeing you soon.

FYI - Big day Monday to get everything cleaned tracked and balanced in order to run the draft that night. I'm waiting for a call to see if we can only draft through the 14th to alleviate some of the burden. Sorry for the short notice I was waiting for clarification from Settlements.

Wendy, Richard please coordinate how the scheduled quantities turn on/off will work

Tks - Bob

Yes - on an ongoing basis, we will be running a mass draft on the night of the 15th each month.  We also have reporting requirements for the last day of the month, but our normal draft process will cover that.  Let me know if you have more questions.  Thanks.

Subject: FW: Things it takes around fifty years to  learn......
1. Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on  the 
same night. 
2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason  why the human race has not 
achieved, and never will achieve, its full  potential, that word would be 
"meetings." 
3. There is a very fine  line between "hobby" and "mental illness." 
4. People who want to share  their religious views with you almost never want 
you to share yours with  them. 
5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its  glories, 
decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His  messenger, 
a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle. 
6. You should  not confuse your career with your life. 
7. No matter what happens,  somebody will find a way to take it too seriously. 
8. When trouble  arises and things look bad, there is always one individual 
who perceives a  solution and is willing to take command.  Very often, that 
individual  is crazy. 
9. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and  dance. 
10. Never lick a steak knife. 
11. Take out the fortune  before you eat the cookie. 
12. The most powerful force in the universe  is gossip. 
13. You will never find anybody giving a clear and compelling  reason why we 
observe daylight savings time. 
14. You should never  say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that 
you think she's  pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her 
at that moment.  
15. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to  make a 
big deal about your birthday.  That time is age eleven.  
16. "The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,  gender, 
religion, economic status, or ethnic background, is that, deep down  inside, 
we ALL believe that we are above average drivers. 
7. The  main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to annoy 
people who  are not in them. 
18. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the  waiter, is not a nice person. 
19. Your friends love you anyway.  
Thought for the day: Never be afraid to try something new.   Remember, 
Amateurs built the Ark... Professionals built the Titanic.

yes, you are correct.  when we watchdog, we'll most likely do VM and Settlements and not PM.  But, in the afternoon, if they need payments out the door, PM will get it.  It goes both ways.  So, if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what, that would help.  

you are correct, 8-12 is logistics critical, and after that it's anyones guess.

Based on Victor's response, I think there is some confusion.  There are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day.  Perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog.  I interpreted it to mean the 8-12 AM period but Victor was thinking the afternoon.  Depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out.

The critical users on the east desk using path manager will be Meredith Homco, Clarissa Garcia, Christina Sanchez and Victor Lamadrid. If you could alert us as to when y'all are invoking watchdog to kick logistics out, that would be great.  THANKS

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!

Register before Friday June 1 and save $100 ! 
Is current storage fill giving us 
a false sense of security? 
It's May. And those AGA storage numbers might have us feeling pretty secure about the future. But a lot can happen in a few short months. Consider these likely scenarios:
This summer hot or hotter than last summer? Predictions abound. 
Record number of new gas fired electric generation units on-line this summer, increasing demand and the draw on storage. 
Severe drought affecting hydropower, the lowest output in 30 years. 
Natural gas supply availability virtually unchanged from last year's levels.                        Fact or fiction?

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="" BridgeEntityName="EOLBridge" Message="Missing StartDate or EndDate" Status="F" BridgeDate="20011025170945CDT"}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the "Bid Week" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break do=
wn the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing=
 a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a premier cov=
er-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties=
. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in=
 every NFL game to help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our=

    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your que=
stions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite yo=
u to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@co=
mmissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =
players just like yourself!   =09


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=
 start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill  Schroeder, Chris Carter, T=
erry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce=
 Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? Answer =
- GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agains=
t a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and=
 three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously n=
ot an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to =
go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so go=
ing with your most established player in this case is the best move. To ans=
wer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolin=
a defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but B=
arlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at b=
est, so our hands are tied.  =09


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=
is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=
e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=
ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=
 like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=
ig game.  =09


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=
non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=
ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=
ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=
n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=
rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=
ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =
current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =
good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=
 will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=
other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=
ntasy player.  =09


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =
giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=
n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=
fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=
 will continue to be a productive player all season.  =09

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Might I request that people put their names on email so we know who they came
from...it might just be my email, but all it shows is brcc.yf as the sender
and unless you add your name (Geoff does this very well) we may not know who
sent it.

thanks,

MARK MADDOX (see, now you know it's from me)

After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

missioner.COM  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Moore su=
ffered a hip pointed during the second quarter of Sunday's game. It was his=
 only play of the game, which demonstrates how little his Fantasy value is =
these days.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updat! ed! 10/15/01 The B=
ears plan to re-sign Matthews possibly on Monday, according to the Chicago =
Sun-Times. He would return to his backup QB job, and isn't worth adding to =
your Fantasy roster.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/15/0=
1 Mike Holmgren has confirmed Trent Dilfer will return to the bench when Se=
attle plays its next game. Hasselbeck is expected to start against Miami on=
 Oct. 28. "The plan is still to prepare for Miami with Matt as the guy," Ho=
lmgren said. Neither player has been a very useful Fantasy starter so far, =
but Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment, while Dilfer has played mista=
ke-free football.  ! Ma! rk Brunell , QB JAC - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01=
 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches. He is expected to play i=
n Week Six.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/15/01 Smith sp=
rained his right ankle on Sunday against the Jets. The injury is not consid=
ered to be serious, and Smith was able to finish the game.  Brian Griese , =
QB DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/15/01 Griese re-aggravated a shoulder injur=
y on Sunday at Seattle. The Denver Post says Griese's shoulder will be re-e=
xamined on Monday or Tuesday. "I was able to come back and ! pl! ay this we=
ek, and I'm hoping to do the same next week," Griese said.  Chad Johnson , =
WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Johnson is expected to miss six weeks =
with a fractured collarbone. He injured the shoulder in the third quarter o=
f Sunday's game.Ron Dugans might now become Cincinanti's third receiver.   =
Terry Jackson , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Jackson suffered a calf=
 injury Sunday. He is listed as probable for next week's game at Chicago.  =
 Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Fightin Farm! er! s Updated 10/15/01 The Buffalo Ne=
ws says Johnson (neck)  looked good in practice on Sunday. He is expected t=
o play in Week Six. ""He threw the ball extremely well, especially in the w=
ind today," said coach Gregg Williams. "He had a fresh arm. It seems like t=
here is no residual effect from it right now."   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR -=
 Terminators Updated 10/15/01 A hip injury prevented Muhammad from finishin=
g Sunday's game. He is expected to play in next week's game against the Red=
skins.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/15/01 Mathis=
 shook off a hip injury and played i! n ! Sunday's game. However, a spraine=
d hand limited him to four catches for 50 yards. The hand injury isn't cons=
idered to be serious. Mathis will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.   Bob=
 Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/15/01 Christian suffered bruise=
d ribs in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Shaw=
n Jefferson , WR ATL - Sack Attack Updated 10/15/01 Jefferson missed a lot =
of playing time Sunday because of a sprained left big toe. He will be evalu=
ated on a day-to-day basis.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Okie Pride Updated =
10/15/01 The St. Louis Rams will be without Faulk for at least one week. Th=
e Rams originally diagnosed the injury as a sprained right medial collatera=
l ligament, but an MRI revealed no severe ligament or cartilage damage.   R=
ams coach Mike Martz fears that Faulk may be sidelined for at least three w=
eeks.   "They (the doctors) think he will be out somewhere between three to=
 four weeks," Martz said. Faulk will be re-evaluated next week and believes=
 it is possible he could return for a key NFC West game against the New Orl=
eans Saints on October 28.   "We'll see," Faulk said. "It's kind of early t=
o say, but you never know."     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated =
10/15/01 Weinke continued to struggle Sunday, fumbling away the center exch=
ange on Carolina's second posse! ss! ion, losing another fumble when his ar=
m was hit as he attempted to pass and also throwing an interception. All th=
ree turnovers led to Saints scores, putting Carolina down 17-0. He finished=
 21-of-39 for 196 yards and two second-half touchdowns. Use him as a reserv=
e for now.    Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Dilfer le=
ft Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with a groin injury. He was replaced=
 by Matt Hasselbeck.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/14/0=
1 Kennison caught six passes for 84 yards and a TD at Seattle. Don't expect=
 Kennison to suddenly turn his career and season around with one solid outi=
ng. He might follow his good game with many weeks of statistical silence,  =
Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/14/01 Alexander had ano=
ther great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against De=
nver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and =
he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current =
level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters ret=
urns.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Fiedler threw for=
 213 yards and a score against the N.Y. Jets, but he was also picked off tw=
ice. He's still not a very reliable Fantasy player, and is no better than a=
 reserve at this point.   Lamar Smith ,! R! B MIA - The Dyno-mite Updated 1=
0/14/01 Smith had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offe=
nse and a touchdown against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game,=
 but he's still good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective. =
  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very p=
rodcutive for the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards an=
d two touchdowns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week jus=
t yet, but Coles is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vin=
ny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01  Testaverde had a goo=
d outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's sti=
ll not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise=
 when the matchup is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10=
/14/01 Milburn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. H=
e will be re-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack U=
pdated 10/14/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushin=
g against Detroit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to cons=
ider droppin! g ! Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis S=
tallions Updated 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, ca=
tching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent eno=
ugh to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if=
 available.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch ha=
d a huge game against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. H=
e's still not worth starting on a weekly basis despite the performance, but=
 he might now warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE=
 GB - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four ya=
rds against the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearl=
y emerged as a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive u=
nits.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good=
 game against San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely b=
e pushed out of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't =
be surrpised to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR G=
B - Fighti! n ! Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138=
 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top def=
ense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, de=
spite his quiet start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor , WR BAL - The Dyn=
o-mite Updated 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at=
 Green Bay. The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche i=
n the Baltimore passing game.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commiss=

FERC Staff to Monitor Pipes for OFO Abuses 
This represents a new kind of approach by the Commission to the market, "which is that we're acting not reacting," said Commissioner Nora Brownell. The creation of this mechanism does not necessarily mean FERC has seen a "pattern of abuse" by pipelines that would warrant "more vigorous pursuit" of OFO activity, she noted. "We are simply setting up the mechanisms by which we will know them [OFO abuses] when we see them and be able to deal with them." 
In a discussion paper issued at Thursday's regular FERC meeting, Gary Mahrenholz of the Office of Markets Rates and Tariffs said FERC staff would rely largely on electronic bulletin board (EBB) postings, pipeline reports and others sources to oversee OFO activity on the pipelines. 
The Commission is taking this action on top of the OFO remedies that were ordered in Order 637, which included requiring pipelines to file OFO activity reports, set proper OFO penalty levels and credit revenues to shippers, timely inform shippers of OFOs, and to improve pipeline-specific OFO definitions. 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt was concerned that FERC was acting before it knew the results of its Order 637 remedies with respect to OFOs. "...I do believe that it is prudent to allow some time for revisions to OFO procedures that we required in 637 to work. The 637 initiative required pipelines to find a way to minimize the issuance of OFOs and to provide data as to OFOs [that] are invoked." She further noted that over-reliance on OFOs was not an industry-wide problem, but rather was confined to specific pipelines. 
Pipelines mostly invoke OFOs during peak-demand periods, particularly during cold periods, to keep their systems operating reliably. During an OFO, shippers are restricted in the amount of gas they can purchase and transport. When shippers are out of balance on a pipeline during an OFO -- meaning that they have put more gas into a pipeline's system than their customers will take out at the other end, or haven't put in enough gas to cover their customers -- they are assessed penalties by pipelines. 
Shippers routinely have complained that pipeline-declared OFOs lasted too long and affected too large a portion of a pipeline's system; that pipelines favored their marketing affiliates when an OFO was in effect; and that OFO measures were poorly defined, giving pipelines significant latitude as to when to declare emergency orders. 
Although Order 637 dealt with many of the shippers' complaints about OFOs, FERC believes the monitoring activity is essential to determine if pipes are using OFOs to inhibit competition and reduce service quality, as well as to assess where capacity expansions are most needed. 
"The new [637] procedures together with more effective monitoring should limit the issuance of OFOs to times when they are absolutely necessary to maintain service reliability," according to FERC staff's discussion paper.

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

Sheresa Barron is back in the hospital for the rest of  her pregnancy. 
 
She had an ultrasound yesterday. One of the little  girls fluid levels looked low. They thought they might have to deliver the  babies today. But, being in the hospital overnight and getting IV fluids has  perked up the little girl. She looks better today. 
 
So, Sheresa will remain in the hospital until the  babies are born. 
 
She may be moved to a room today or tomorrow.  
 
Keep her in your prayers.
 
Calls and visits welcome.

After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

Please be sure that your desk is completely cleaned out and that there is NOTHING left in your area._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

For the past two production months I have had rate issues with Oasis.  I just talked with Marilyn Gilliam and suggested that Natalie Baker be put on a distribution list so Natalie can work on the rates during the month instead of me coming down at the end of the month and needing rates fixed.  I was informed by Marilyn that we were not sending rates to Oasis and that we should be doing this which would help prevent rate discrepancies at the end of the month.  

Mike--if you have any questions about sending the rates to Oasis, you can contact Paul McPheeters at Oasis and he can assist you.

Natalie--this is just an FYI.

Two quick questions...

Volume Management seems to think that we had business on Blue Dolphin Pipeline for August 2001.  I told them that we had none, and that whatever they have is AEP business.  They insisted that it was ours and sent down Allocation Statements from Blue Dolphin.  WE have nothing in the system, so I have no idea what to say to them beyond what I think is the case, that AEP has this business now.

As for the Industrial research, I got your message and I assume I should focus on the ones on the map.  The map has 17 plants listed with pipeline connects.  I will call them for capacities and flexibility.

All errors were taken care of by Jay and I with little trouble.

Thanks.

Mike

Daren---Just so you know...

Mike will be taking Cornshucker today from me, (I no longer have access to the deal tickets concerning this), he is doing both the hub business and oasis also, which should keep him pretty busy.   It looks like he has pretty much got it, but we will help him if he needs something.

Subject:	Bosses Day
Importance:	High

Hi All-

Was thinking of doing a gift certificate to Mark's (a really great restaurant in Montrose) for Bob for Bosses day so he and Carolyn can have a night out.  If we each kick in $15, that will give us $120--am thinking that we could do a $100 GC, then I'll pick up a NYRangers shirt when I'm home this weekend with the other $20, or we could just do a $125 GC, whatever you guys want.  I've got a card for everyone to sign as well.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome--but either way, plese get me your $$ by the end of the day today since I'll run over there this afternoon and get the GC if we all agree on that.

Thanks,
Suzanne

RENEWABLE ENERGY FACT SHEETS

UNEPs Energy Programme addresses the environmental consequences of energy
production and use, such as global climate change and local air pollution.
It assists decision-makers in government and the private sector to make
better, more informed energy choices which fully integrate environmental and
social costs.

One of the areas UNEP Energy (www.uneptie.org) is concerned with is
renewable energy issues, and has published a series of Renewable Energy
Technology fact sheets on various types of renewable energies.

 Dear Daren:  From out of something as horrific as the events of September 11th has come something truly amazing - a growing sense of patriotism in America not felt for decades.   We've felt it here at iWon - in fact, we've had numerous iWon members write to us and ask if iWon sold American Flags. They've been hard to come by recently, but now, through the cooperation of The National Flag & Display Company, we're proud to offer American Flag Kits to our members.  Each kit includes one (1) 3' x 5' polyester flag, 3-piece 6' pole, styrene eagle and mounting bracket.    Click here to order your American Flag Kit  - and show your pride in our nation!    Thank you, The iWon Team 	[IMAGE]

<<
 Top Ten List:
 How you can tell you grew up in the Church of Christ.....

 10.  You know the 1st, 2nd, and 4th verses to nearly every song in the
 book.

 9.  You think it might be unscriptural to drain the baptistry.

 8.  You were 18 years old before you knew that guideguardanddirectus was
not
one word.

 7.  You used to think the offering was part of the Lord's Supper.

 6.  You've wondered who Ebon Pinon was.

 5.  You've never seen an original showing of "The Ed Sullivan Show" or any
other program aired on early Wednesday or Sunday nights.

 4.  You were the only kid in 6th grade who knew what "acappella" meant.

 3.  You were the only kid who had actually sung alto or tenor before
 taking junior high chorus.

 2.  During a service you have: laughed, cried, spanked a child, dropped a
book, walked to the bathroom, passed a note, emptied your purse on the pew,
eaten a cookie, chewed gum, taken medicine, whispered to someone sitting
beside you, winked at a friend, coughed, sneezed, burped, or said "amen,"
but
you have NEVER, EVER clapped.

 And the #1 way to tell that you grew up in the church of Christ:

 1.  You have stood for 13 verses of "Just As I Am" with the last stanza
 sung softly.

 Phil. 1:3  "I thank my GOD every time I remember YOU!"

r Insight article this week focuses on the state of the energy in Asia.  Li=

utives in Asia are facing a host of changes-e-business, regulatory changes,=
 and the commercialization of alternative and micro energy sources.  All of=
 these are examined in the article below, and it paints an interesting pict=

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.  

Regards,

Tammy

Subject:	Path Manager Rewrite / Optimization project
Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

During our United Way 2000 Campaign that was held last fall, you were kind enough to pledge a contribution to the United Way. Our records indicate that your preference was to pay by check.  If you have already paid your contribution, thank you!  If you have not, we wanted to provide you with the information that you need in order to send in your contribution.

All checks should be made out to the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast.  They can be sent interoffice mail in a confidential envelope to the attention of Zulie Flores, EB 1612.  If for some reason, you do not know the amount that you pledged, you can call Zulie at 
3-3908 and she will be able to assist you.

We had such a successful campaign last year and it was due in large part to your generosity.  Thank you for your support of this very important program - you did make a difference!

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Hi,
 
I know the stock sucks and things look  black, but I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving and a good trip.
 
At this 10 seconds there is 2 min. left  in the 1st quarter of the Neb./Colo. game and I have struck my colors.  Discretion being the better part of valor. My Aggie neighbor saw me taking them  down and just laughed ......... can you imagine?
 
We sure had the polls fooled for awhile  ............. and some of us more ignorant fans.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

I would like to use two people on the west desk, since different pipes tend to have different issues. The 2 people will be Shannon Groenewold and Stacey Brewer.

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.  

Regards,

Tammy

Subject:	Path Manager Rewrite / Optimization project
Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

 Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks'=
 next game October 28 against Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent=
 Dilfer on Sunday. "Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing =
at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove," Head Coach Mike Holmgren tol=
d the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantas=
y starter right now, espec! ia! lly against the Dolphins' defense in Week S=
even.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Dilfer suffered =
a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected =
to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-=
Intelligencer. "There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll jus=
t leave it at that," Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. "He's i=
njured, and he won't practice this week." Dilfer is probably the better Fan=
tasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team f=
or the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Sack Attack Updated 10/16=
/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson=
 could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardso=
n is battling a shoulder injury.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallio=
ns Updated 10/16/01 Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the ext=
ent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. Th=
e results were expected back Tuesday.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - The Dyno-mite=
 Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained an=
kle during Sunday's game agains! t ! the Jets, according to the Miami Heral=
d . He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye =
week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - WidowMakers Updated 10/16/01 The Broncos are=
 unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, accord=
ing to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulde=
r revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeri=
es. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's gam=
e, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB=
 BUF - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable=
 for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been =
a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe t=
hat will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair t=
he torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on i=
njured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall =
Faulk , RB STL - Okie Pride Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out !=
 of! Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. =
"He really could possibly play this week," coach Mike Martz said. "We're no=
t going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out." If Faulk is=
 unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the gam=
e. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start =
Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout the week.   Justin =
McCareins , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sideline=
d six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. H=
e is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in th=
e joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game a=
nd had two catches for 70 yards.   Eddie Berlin , WR TEN - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams,  will b=
e sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right sho=
ulder on a kickoff return Su! nd! ay.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dea=
ler that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Rav=
ens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup=
 if you need an extra wideout this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Sack At=
tack Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game again=
st the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Battagl=
ia , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Battaglia is listed as probable f=
or Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left sh=
oulder.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Dyno-mite Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was f=
eeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe c=
oncussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at=
 Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second=
 quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Su=
nday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his ne=
xt two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Mond=
ay, Grbac declared himself fit enough to play. "I'm still a little fogg! y,=
! and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive," he s=
aid, "but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready."      Redskins , DT WAS - Okie =
Pride Updated 10/16/01 Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained=
 left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after su=
staining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexan=
der , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Alexander suffered a sprained ri=
ght ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutc=
hes on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - =
Swamis Stallions Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Sta=
ley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. =
However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which=
 will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's=
 game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so =
expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelph=
ia.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fightin Farmers Upd! at! ed 10/16/01 Schroed=
er (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for =
Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroede=
r would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go.   Joe=
y Galloway , WR DAL - Fightin Farmers Updated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a =
sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowb=
oys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover fro=
m the injury in time for the team's next game.    Reggie Swinton , WR DAL -=
 Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre=
-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, =
and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated =
10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washingt=
on. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fant=
asy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attache=
s his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six=
 weeks of action due to the procedure.    Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Mud Dogz=
 Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against =
Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make mu=
ch of an impact Fantasy-wise.    Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Sack Attack Updated=
 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday.=
 Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against P=
hiladelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a dro=
p in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - =
Free Agent Updated 10/16/01! Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's =
loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He i=
s expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas=
 City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas=
 Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN =
- Pongo Pack Updated 10/16/01 Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, =
which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green=
 Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, =
it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  =
 Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to=
 get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett=
's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper lea=
gues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Pack=
ers' defense.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/16/01 Acco=
rding to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss =
this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on =
Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get=
 the start in Bennett's absence.   More Updates  Rosters Teams   [IMAGE]  [=

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, "We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?"  
"Sure," said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, "Now go out and play."  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What religion do you think we are?"  
The oldest one said, "We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you."  
The littlest one said, "Didn't you smell that water?"  
"Yes. What do you think that means?"  
"That means we're Pisscopalians"

Following up for our sell-out conference in Phoenix, December 2001 that was
attended by over 250 CEO's, senior executives and press, and Energy
Exchanges Online II:  Energy Trading in the New Economy USA (September
2001), Eyeforenergy brings you the premier networking and discussion
conference for the energy trading community.  Meet, do business and discuss
the big issues over 2 days with the leaders in energy trading in Amsterdam.

* Emissions Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Emissions trading options are ripe for the picking - so how can you make
sure you're ready to profit from GHG?  Let's face it - you can't really
afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the
international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per
annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how
you can best seize this exciting nwe market opportunity.  As ever, the
conference will be driven by the industry leaders in this arena, backed up
by expert advice from those helping the indsutry make the right moves in
emissions.

* Weather Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Today's business is all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather
derivatives has become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging at
utilities, airlines, and agriculture have at hand to off-set risks
associated with temperature and precipitation.  With over 70% of Europe's
companies facing weather-related risk, knowing about the latest advances in
weather trading is a necessity.

Eyeforenergy's latest event will be run in conjunction with our European
online trading conference, Energy Trading in the New Economy, and
Eyeforenergy's Emissions Trading 2002 event, so you can learn about the
latest developments in energy and emissions trading all under one roof.

http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/


* The Business of Fuel Cells for Transportation
  Dearborn Hotel, Detroit, Michigan
  April 30 - May 1, 2002

As manufacturers are increasingly developing technologies with the energy
industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.

If anyone gives platelets, it would be appreciated.  He has had one
transplant and is on the list for another.  I have worked with him at
Halliburton...  Prayers are definitely needed too.

Amy Brock

	I just found out that that you need to make an appointment to give
platelets.  Call the Blood Donor Center at 713/441-3415 to make an
appointment.


	Dave is continuing to fight his battle with the liver transplant.
Unfortunately, Dave is not doing very well right now.  He is currently in
ICU and is bleeding internally.  Additionally, the disease is attacking his
bone marrow.

	Dave is in need of Blood Platelets.  If anyone wishes to donate,
please call:

	Methodist Hospital
	Dunn Tower
	One behalf of Charles David Conklin
	713-790-3311
	6565 Fannin, Houston, Texas

	Please keep Dave in your thoughts and prayers.

	Steve

The stock market sprang back a bit this spring in April and earlier in May.
And while the market gave back those gains at the end of May, we're still
positive about prospects for the rest of 2001. Here's how things look for
the year and recent month:

	6/1/00	1/2/01	5/1/01	5/31/01	% chg.
Yr.	% chg.
YTD	% chg.
May '01
Dow Jones	10,652	10,787	10,898	10,912	2%	1%	0%
S&P 500	1,449	1,320	1,266	1,256	-13%	-5%	-1%
Nasdaq	3,582	2,471	2,168	2,110	-41%	-15%	-3%
* does not include reinvested dividends

Dan Laufenberg, American Express Financial Corporation's chief economist,
says investors have several reasons to be optimistic long term. These
include:

*	Continued interest rate cuts - The Federal Reserve cut rates yet
another half a percent in May, for a total reduction of 2.50% so far this
year. Historically, such cuts have taken a few months to affect the economy
and market - but the eventual result has often been a substantial upturn for
both.

*	Newly passed tax cuts - Congress has passed a $1.35 trillion,
wide-ranging tax-cut package that should put extra dollars into U.S.
consumers' pockets soon. That, in turn, could eventually boost corporate
profits and stock prices.

*	Signs of a strengthening economy - The upturn in stocks this spring,
continued rate cuts and the prospect of lower taxes all helped boost
consumer confidence in May. The New York-based Conference Board said its
Consumer Confidence Index jumped in May to 115.5 from 109.9 - more than
economists expected. The rise in confidence is important since consumers are
a major driver of the U.S. economy.

Dan Laufenberg says these positive developments support his forecast of
stronger economic growth - and potential stock market improvement - through
the rest of the year. However, he adds that the economy remains vulnerable
and volatility could continue, so a long-term investment focus is best.

I'll keep you informed as economic and market developments continue. Thank
you for your loyalty and understanding as we ride out this market
correction.

Best regards,








"Make all you can, save all you can, give all you can."

Hi All-

Was thinking of doing a gift certificate to Mark's (a really great restaurant in Montrose) for Bob for Bosses day so he and Carolyn can have a night out.  If we each kick in $15, that will give us $120--am thinking that we could do a $100 GC, then I'll pick up a NYRangers shirt when I'm home this weekend with the other $20, or we could just do a $125 GC, whatever you guys want.  I've got a card for everyone to sign as well.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome--but either way, plese get me your $$ by the end of the day today since I'll run over there this afternoon and get the GC if we all agree on that.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

     Friday, October 19, 2001 Issue 39   EDITORIAL  Weathering Risk   This =
week's Briefing is concerned with risk, chiefly that presented by weather i=
n the face of newly deregulated (re-regulated?) energy markets.  Our main f=
eature explains how susceptible the industry has become to increasingly vol=
atile weather, and how the plethora of risks which become presented (includ=
e those directly related to earnings) can be alleviated by trading a portfo=
lio of weather derivatives.  We also outline some of the companies who are =
already emerging as major players in what is already becoming an essential =
tool for managing financial risk.   On a broader note, our second feature o=
utlines approaches to managing risk in general, and how energy companies ca=

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.  

Regards,

Tammy

Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Have a Question About the Site?   ? Need Help Choosing Your Starters?   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  	


    Have a Question About the Site?     Just a reminder to review our Questions & Answers page for answers to frequently asked questions, and notification of any issues we may be working on. Click Help on any page, then scroll to the bottom of the help screen and click Questions & Answers.  	


    Need Help Choosing Your Starters?     Go to Statistics, Player Scoring to see the scoring trends of every player on your team. The report will display each player on your team, and their fantasy scores for each week of the season. Use the report to gauge which players are hot and which are not. Use the report to scout other teams' players, or all players at a specific position.  	


	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Andy Neely, San Diego, CA     I've got so much talent at RB I'm not sure who to start this weekend. Marshall Faulk is a no-brainer, but that leaves me to choose among Eddie George, Mike Anderson and Garrison Hearst. Eddie would be my first choice, but he is nursing an injury and going up against a good Tampa Bay defense. Answer - GG     You're right to have doubts about George this week. Hearst has looked good in his last two games, but he's not finding the end zone and continues to split carries with Kevan Barlow. That leaves Anderson, who has the best chance at posting solid Fantasy numbers against a Seattle defense that has been very inconsistent through the first four weeks of the season.  	


  Question - Robert Smith, Philadelphia, PA     I have Frank Wycheck. He has not produced the way I thought he would this year, and his health is uncertain. Should I pick up Erron Kinney or Dwayne Carswell and drop Wycheck?    Answer - GG     Wycheck is dealing with a strained neck, but he's expected to start this weekend against Tampa Bay. Erron Kinney is emerging as a solid pass-catching tight end, but Wycheck is still one of Tennessee's most reliable receiving threats and is far too valuable to simply drop. He's averaged nearly 70 receptions over the past three years and is still a top-tier Fantasy player.  	


  Question - Joe Serodio, Boston, MA     I had Jamal Anderson as my No. 1 back, but ever since his injury I've had to use Jerome Bettis and Thomas Jones as my starters. I was offered Mike Alstott and Priest Holmes for Bill Schroeder. What should I do?    Answer - GG     Depending on the depth of your receivers, we'd suggest making this deal if it's the best trade you can negotiate. Alstott will be Tampa Bay's featured back for at least another week, and Holmes seems to have secured the No. 1 spot in Kansas City with Tony Richardson's recent injury. Schroeder has been a great Fantasy player thus far, but it'll be tough for him to keep up his current pace. While it may be tough to let him go, dealing Schroeder for Alstott and Holmes is the best move you can make to ease the loss of Anderson.  	


    Tip of the Week      Dave Slater, Pittsburgh, PA:  Hines Ward is one of the most underrated receivers in the league. He already has 24 receptions this season, and it's just a matter of time before those receptions turn into touchdowns. Pittsburgh's offense may not be the best, but Ward is the best receiving threat on their roster and will develop into a reliable Fantasy player.

Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

ad a decent outing on Sunday, posting 77 yards of total offense and a touch=
down against the N.Y. Jets. He did fumble twice in the game, but he's still=
 good enough to be a No. 1 back from a Fantasy perspective.   Laveranues Co=
les  , WR NYJ - Sack Attack Updated 10/14/01 Coles was very prodcutive for =
the N.Y. Jets on Sunday, posting five catches for 77 yards and two touchdow=
ns against Miami. He may not be worth starting every week just yet, but Col=
es is slowly becoming a player worthy of a roster spot.   Vinny Testaverde =
, QB NYJ - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Testaverde had a good outing agains=
t Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth st=
arting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the match=
up is right.   Glyn Milburn , RB CHI - Fr! ee! Agent Updated 10/14/01 Milbu=
rn left Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He will be re=
-evaluated on Monday.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14=
/01 Bennett did nothing yet again, posting only 46 yards rushing against De=
troit. Unless you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider droppin=
g Bennett altogether.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Swamis Stallions Updated=
 10/14/01 Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine pass=
es for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every=
 week at this point, but he'! s ! easily worth a roster spot if available. =
  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Batch had a huge gam=
e against Minnesota, throwing for 345 yards and three scores. He's still no=

w warrant a reserve role in deeper leagues.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free A=
gent Updated 10/14/01 Franks caught only two passes for four yards against =
the Ravens, but both catches resulted in TDs. Franks has clearly emerged as=
 a primary goal-line threat on one of the NFL's top offensive units.  David=
 Patten  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Patten had a good game again=
st San Diego, catching seven passes for 73 yards. He'll likely be pushed ou=
t of the starting lineup now that Terry Glenn is back, so don't be surrpise=
d to see his numbers decrease somewhat.   Antonio Freeman , WR GB - Fightin=
 Farmers Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD a=
gainst Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clea=
r signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet=
 start prior to this week.  Travis Taylor ,! W! R BAL - The Dyno-mite Updat=
ed 10/14/01 Taylor caught three passes for 50 yards and a TD at Green Bay. =
The second-year wideout seems to have finally found his niche in the Baltim=

nn had a huge game in his return from suspension, catching seven passes for=
 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis, =
but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receiver=
s.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Brookins rushed =
for 33 yards and a TD against Green Bay. The y! ou! ng, strong back might c=
ontinue to emerge in Baltimore's offense as the season wears on.  Troy Brow=
n , WR NE - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Brown had a great outing against S=
an Diego, posting 11 catches for 117 yards against San Diego. With Terry Gl=
enn returning, Brown could become a pretty relaible Fantasy player facing N=
o. 2 cornerbacks on a weekly basis.   Darnay Scott , WR CIN - WidowMakers U=
pdated 10/14/01 Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the Brown=
s, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scott in t=
he passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflected it.=
  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Pongo Pack Updated 10/14/01 Conway had a solid ga=
me, posting four catches for 117 yards against New England. He is slowly be=
coming Doug Flutie's favorite target, and is becoming a much more reliable =
Fantasy player than in years past.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Dyno-mite=
 Updated 10/14/01 Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win over San D=
iego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantasy playe=
r, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the matchup is r=
ight.   Kevin Johnson , WR CL! E ! - Terminators Updated 10/14/01 Johnson c=
aught eight passes for 153 yards and a TD against the Bengals. It appears t=
he Cleveland wideout is starting to re-emerge as a quality Fantasy player. =
 Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 Brady had his first impres=
sive outing on Sunday, throwing for 364 yards and two touchdowns in the Pat=
riots' 29-26 overtime win over San Diego. Despite the great performace, Bra=
dy is still not worth anything more than a reserve spot Fantasy-wise.   Jam=
es Jackson , RB CLE - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/14/01 Jackson played agains=
t Cincinnati, but was l! im! ited to only 22 rushing yards on 14 carries. T=
he rookie running back, who played despite some rib problems, has been inco=
nsistent and unreliable so far.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Okie Pride =
Updated 10/14/01 Tomlinson's yardage numbers (87 total) were subpar by his =
standards, but he did score another touchdown for San Diego. He's one of th=
e top tailbacks in the league and should be a weekly starter Fantasy-wise. =
  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Okie Pride Updated 10/14/01 Flutie had a solid game=
 on Sunday, posting 270 yards passing and a touchdown against New England. =
He's still not worth starting every week, but is better of used when the ma=
tchup is right.   Justin McCareins  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/14/01 =
McCareins started in place of the injured Derrick Mason on Sunday against T=
ampa Bay. He did have two catches for 70 yards in the game, but still warra=
nts very little Fantasy consideration.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/14/01 Hayes caught seven passes for 44 yards against the Saints=
. If opponents continue to pay extra attention to Muhsin Muhammad, Hayes mi=
ght continue to post some respectable numbers.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Wid=
owMakers Updated 10/14/01 George had his best Fantasy game of the season, p=
osting 132 yards of total offense and a score against Tampa Bay. The perfor=

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant "live" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

Hi,
 
Lunch ------- I'm free any of those days.  Whichever is easiest for you. I just need a few hours notice.
 
I'm glad you enjoyed your vacation.  Soccer coach huh. I'd be looking to get even on that one.
 
I, of course, have a few zillion  questions re Enron --- we can save those for lunch.
 
Now I know you have gone home by the time  I write this on Friday before the BIG game between the BCS #1 and the soon to be  named #1 CORNHUSKERS. I did need to state the outcome before the game. (Of  course I have eaten much crow in past years).
 
Later,
Ken

credit card debt will double, whether you buy any thing or not. Find out
how to stop this. Contact US at Tower & Associates, Inc.www.towerandassociates.com

All,

Move time is fast approaching!!!!  IT will be performing a workstation audit on everyone who will be moving to ECS.  This audit is a physical audit of all your IT equipment (computer, telephone, printers, etc.) to document the equipment for each individual.  They will not be accessing the workstation in any way, nor will we power off any workstation.  

IT will begin the workstation audit Wednesday, October 17th around 6:00 pm and will continue for up to 4 consecutive nights (and/or this weekend) to ensure that we identify all equipment.   They will perform these audits after hours so as not to interrupt any daily activities. 

Additionally, with the Churn Freeze already in place, it is important to note that once the audits are performed this week, the information gathered is what will be used to plan for the migration of your IT equipment to ECS.  If changes are made to ANY of the workstations (increase in monitors; CPU upgrades, laptop change, etc.), these will not be captured, and we cannot guarantee these changes will be in place with your move to ECS.  


Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Brandee and Alex

FARMER, JERRY D:
 
Attached below you will find the final Evaluation forms for your direct reports; these forms have been pre-populated with your employees' basic data. If you have already completed your employees' final Evaluations, you may disregard these forms. 
 
When completing the Evaluation, carefully consider employee input, consolidated feedback and your observations of their performance and contribution, and encourage employee participation in the evaluation discussion. For many employees, this will be the only formal opportunity to discuss their performance with their supervisor.  
 
Final Evaluations should be completed and returned to your HR representative by August 17 (July 31 for all those in Business Units reporting to Enron Europe) for employees in job groups below Vice President level. 
 
If you have any questions, please contact your HR representative or the PEP help desk at x34777, option 4.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Subject: Best Church Web Sites and Best Practices


I have taken the assignment of gathering information about best practices
for church web sites for the Communications Task Force at Bammel.  I am
interested in hearing from each of you regarding your all-time favorite
church web sites.  These sites do not have to be published by churches of
Christ.

"Best practices" is a phrase that kept recurring in the first Task Force
meeting on Saturday, June 2.  This would seem to include:
"Essential" content (i.e.., maps, service times, etc.)
Privacy concerns (How do we provide great information without compromising
the privacy of our members?)
What sort of content would make Bammel stand out as a superior site?  (I am
not talking about look and feel, just information.)
Your own pet peeves about church web sites.  I figure that you are
representative of what others will think and probably more critical than
most.

Feel free to recruit opinions from other sources.  Send me links.  Express
yourself, but please respond as quickly as possible.  The time is very short
for gathering this information; it must be collected, analyzed and condensed
into notes for the elders by the end of June!  This means that I really need
to hear from you this week, if possible, and the sooner the better.

Thank you for your help in this effort.  Our hope is that we will dream
God-sized dreams so that He will be glorified.

Bob, 

Michael Olsen in Texas Logistics is receiving statements from Volume Mgmt for Blue Dolphin Pipeline.  Mike is fairly sure that Blue Dolphin went with HPL.  Is that correct or do we still have some business on it?

Hey guys, if you're the person keeping attendance  in your group could you let me know that you're the attendance person for this  year.  You also need to get a copy of your group's info to Becky  Poindexter at the church.  I think she is ready to catch up on your  attendance for the fall semester so far.  I'll get your records from  her.
 
Keep up the good work!
 
Bobby

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).

I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.  

			ENW All-Logistics Meeting
			Friday, October 12
			2:00 to 3:00 PM

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

	 When a disaster strikes who is going to take care of your family?  Experts warn that you must be prepared to be on your own for a minimum  of three-days after a disaster. City, state, and national emergency personnel  will be overwhelmed. They may not be able to respond immediately. Their  ability to reach you and your family may be severely hindered by the disaster.  You must be able to care for yourself during these critical 72 hours.  For this purpose we have prepared a  complete Disaster Recovery Kit.

"Our  recommendations following the September 11 attacks are the same as they  always have been. It's just that people are paying more attention to them  now."      Click  to Prepare Your Family!

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

Just to let everyone know...Sheresa got to
come home today on medication and home care
and will hopefully get to finish out her pregnancy
there in bed of course.  Caella Chappell has the
food list for dinners for them if anyone wants to
help them out.  They live in Candlelight Hills.
Keep them in your prayers.

Jill

Ok guys!  I am going to help you out this Holiday Season with an idea your Woman won't forget!!!
 For those of you who don't know, I am an Independent Mary Kay Beauty Consultant!  

This Christmas I am selling what I call the 12 Days of Christmas!
What I do is stack up 12 Hat boxes from Small on top to the biggest on bottom and tie big ribbons around it!  You will give this to her on Dec 13th!
On Dec 13th she opens the small box and then on Dec 24th she opens the big box!  And, in each box there will be a special note!!!  Wow, how clever you will be and win lots of points on such a romantic idea!!!

The packages range from $150 to $350  Just tell me how much you want to spend and I will customize the boxes for you!
She'll love it!  I will include the #1 Brand of Cosmetics in America, plus candles, frames, etc!!!  (also, if you have a special item you would like to include in the Last Box, I will add that to it,,,such as jewelry, etc!)

Please let me know if you are interested!  This little Elf must get busy now shopping and wrapping for you!!!  I will deliver to your office or home Early in December.  You may want to hide it until Dec 13th or just put it by the tree and keep the suspense!

And, I will also be selling Gift Baskets ready for you to give!!!  (Mom, Sis, Aunt, Wife, Girlfriend, Etc.)  Let me make this Holiday season easy on you!!!  Please call me or e-mail me and we can get your shopping done early this year!!!

Does anyone have any email lists that they still use from Lotus Notes - (apart from the main team lists and Michael Kass's Team lists?).

Let me know the addresses and I can get a new mailing list set up in Outlook for you.

many thanks from Tara

Reminder!!!

Please circulate this message to team members/department heads where you feel it is appropriate. Thanks

A mailing group is a collect of people that you email under one common name e.g. Enron London Assistances. In Outlook these are called distribution lists.

We need to migrate all Lotus Notes mailing groups to Outlook. 

If you are responsible for a mailing group, or you have a mailing group for your team, can you please send me the name of it.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me.

Thanks and regards
Alison

Dear Mr. Jerry Daren Farmer,
I promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide an update on the situation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the accident.
In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will communicate those results.
On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11. 
I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing across our system.
On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle, thanks for your support.
Sincerely, 
Mike Gunn
Executive Vice President
American Airlines

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

response is hilarious!!!)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ya know.......some people look for things like this...and it amazes me.  At
first I rolled my eyes....then I read Dave's response and I couldn't have
said it better if I had all day to do it.

(Dave's response)
Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11 letters in the name
"David Pawson!" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few weeks.
Wait a sec ... just realized "YOU CAN'T HIDE" also has 11 letters! What
am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't
believe it! Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could
hide! But no ... PLANET EARTH" has 11 letters, too!  Maybe Nostradamus can
help me. But dare I trust him? There are 11 letters in "NOSTRADAMUS." I
know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in "THE RED
CROSS," can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE"
has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone help?  Anyone? If so, send me email.
No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11 letters....

Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING INSANE???" Eleven letters!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though "I'LL DIE ALONE" has
11 letters.....  Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed! Our
Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4_!

 NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM   Redskins , DT WAS - Okie =
Pride Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday=
 due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (=
leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carol=
ina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , =
WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probabl=
e for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at pract=
ice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffer=
s , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work=
 in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orlean=
s. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muh=
sin Muhammad , WR CAR - Terminators Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are st=
ill sore after taking a few ! sh! ots during Sunday's game against New Orle=
ans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limit=
ed. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may w=
ant to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to=
 a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quar=
terback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback th=
is week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Ter=
ance Mathis , WR ATL - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) retu=
rned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against Ne=
w Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy pe=
rspective. !   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Sack Attack Updated 10/17/01 Jeff=
erson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the =
starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to u=
se Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf wo=
rked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was fillin=
g in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen righ=
t knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he=
 has no real Fantasy value at this time.    Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick =
is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of bril=
liance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this=
 point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Pongo Pack Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is=
 listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankl=
e injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice servin=
g as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR M! IN! - Pon=
go Pack Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game a=
gainst Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to s=
tart him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unles=
s it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He return=
s to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  =
Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Mud Dogz Updated 10/17/01 According to published r=
eports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at ! Sa! n Diego. H=
e has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wa=
nts him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week=
, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any =
Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Terminators Updated 10/17/01=
 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too pr=
oductive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.=
   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Mud Dogz Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggle=
d in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in =
the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lo=
t of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins=
 will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple =
of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC=
 - WidowMakers Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by head=
aches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 2=
00 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01=
 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is=
 listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does ! pl! ay. Brady =
only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Sack Attack Upd=
ated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to c=
atch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , =
WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the s=
eason after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. =
"We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head C=
oach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI s=
howed a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fanta=
sy team. Larry F! os! ter assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyron=
e Wheatley , RB OAK - Swamis Stallions Updated 10/17/01 According to publis=
hed reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprai=
n. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before =
he was hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Pongo Pack Updated 10/17/01 The Con=
tra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley=
 as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was=
 reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry  , =
RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans t=
o have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis i=
n both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay Ri=
emersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bi=
lls want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jon=
as Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to b=
lock more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in =
the passing game.  Jerom! e ! Pathon , WR IND - Bloomin Idiots Updated 10/1=
7/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week agains=
t the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne w=
ould start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor plac=
ed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins =
do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Mud Dogz Updated =
10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Star, Smith could end up splitting=
 more carrie! s ! with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave C=
ampo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the m=
ove will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.   Stephen Alex=
ander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Alexander underwent an MRI on =
his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expecte=
d to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to res=
erve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Free A=
gent Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's lo=
ss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this week=
end's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play.=
   Greg Clark, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Clark went through his m=
ost extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three=
 weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the Contra Costa Times. "I ran=
 (a half mile). I never could do any of that before the last surgery (which=
 removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minute=
s. It's an amazing difference in comparison." Head Coach Steve Mariucci doe=
sn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, howev=
er, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.    Mo=
re Updates  Player News&n! bs! p;Teams    Fightin Farmers Player News - Pro=
vided by Commissioner.COM  Joey Galloway , Active WR Updated 10/17/01 Gallo=
way (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to res=
t his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status=
 for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined.   Rob Johnson , R=
eserve QB Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday=
's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fa=
ntasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will chan=
ge this week. Don't use Johnson.  Bill Schroeder , Reserve WR Updated 10/16=
/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be ava=
ilable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision =
on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him t=
o go.   Derrick Alexander , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Alexander overcame =
back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held to just one catch =
for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements have rendered Alex=
ander a disappointment so far this season.  Antonio Freeman , Reserve WR Up=
dated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD against Balt=
imore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear signal th=
at Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet start prio=
r to this week.  James Allen , Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Allen had a soli=
d game on Sunday, rushing for 75 yards and a touchdown. However, the perfor=
mance is a bit tainted Fantasy-wise since it was against a weak Arizona def=
ensive front. Don't expect thos type of numbers from the Bears' tailback on=

There are two ENA contracts with Blue Dolphin - FT and IT and one for ENAU.  Were both of the contracts assigned?  In Global, the only contracts that show as assigned to AEP are  Global # 96032498 (ENA - FT) and Global #96063862 (ENAU - IT).  

The other contract Global#96037499 still shows as an active contract for ENA and the pipe continues to invoice us.

Taking into account that Global may be wrong, is there something that either of you have with the assigned global numbers so that we can get Global updated and notify the pipe?

Bob, 

Michael Olsen in Texas Logistics is receiving statements from Volume Mgmt for Blue Dolphin Pipeline.  Mike is fairly sure that Blue Dolphin went with HPL.  Is that correct or do we still have some business on it?

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

Subject:	Bosses Day
Importance:	High

Hi All-

Was thinking of doing a gift certificate to Mark's (a really great restaurant in Montrose) for Bob for Bosses day so he and Carolyn can have a night out.  If we each kick in $15, that will give us $120--am thinking that we could do a $100 GC, then I'll pick up a NYRangers shirt when I'm home this weekend with the other $20, or we could just do a $125 GC, whatever you guys want.  I've got a card for everyone to sign as well.  Any other suggestions are of course welcome--but either way, plese get me your $$ by the end of the day today since I'll run over there this afternoon and get the GC if we all agree on that.

Thanks,
Suzanne
