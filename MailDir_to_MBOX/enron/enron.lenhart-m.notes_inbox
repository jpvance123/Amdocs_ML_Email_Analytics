i just came in early to catch up.  i was out half day friday and all day 
yesterday.  i am up for whatever, but i dont want to get totally trashed on 
thursday and not be able to go out friday or saturday.  

dc is such a great city.  i could definitely live there. my friend works for 
the Speaker of the House so saturday he took me to the capitol and i got to 
see the speakers office and his private balcony that overlooks the washington 
monument and a lot of other offices and rooms that are off-limits to the 
public.  the weather was unbelievable - during the day not a cloud in the 
sky, high of 70 and at night 50. it was awesome.  we went out in georgetown 
friday and saturday.  matt, you would totally love this place. there was 
about 4 bars outdoors right on the Potomac with Watergate in the background 
and this huge fountain.  we should all take a trip there for a weekend - or 
boston, thats the next place i want to go.  i need to move out of this city, 
but then i would miss all of y'all.  so.... anyway, what are we doing this 
weekend?

what are you doing at work so early?  i am already pumped to go out this 
weekend.  fri was bad for susan and eric.  they were the only one doing 
shots.  everyone else was fairly sober and just hanging out.  it was pretty 
discusting.  let's hit the town this weekend.  maybe even thurs.  how was 
dc?  i heard that place is a blast.

at the Hotel Monaco downtown at a bridal show, so I didn't tell Max & I
upgraded it to a suite with hot tub & all, so we are staying there Sat. &
sat. nite, getting massages and I made reserv. at Panzano's for
dinner...that will be our Valentine's day, since we were both exhausted
last nite.  Hope he likes it...he bought "the ring"...so he has "get out of
jail card" for every holiday this year, i told him...:)
  What did you do to piss off your girlfriend at dinner? Nothing a few
flowers & back massage can't take care of,...
Take care-
jen

witty come-back came the next morning when i remembered the dipshit telling 
me this. too little, too late! it would have been nice to embarrass him in 
front of his friends.  i hope i dont need to tell you not to use this.

ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a
country other than the country of origin are advised that the provisions of
a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to the entire
journey, including any portion entirely within the country of origin or
destination.  For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed
stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special
contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the
liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death
of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven
damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up
to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier.
The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and
costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is
made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum
of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers
traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey
not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of
America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers
is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000.
The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at
all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request.
Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a
private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the
carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of
carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance
company representative.

NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY
Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher
value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most
international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys)
the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and
$400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S.
points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to
be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on
certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile,
valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from
the carrier.

CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED
A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR
REGULATIONS
SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS

NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS
Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of
contract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any
inconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms
and conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.
 Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S.
(including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the
individual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein
incorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage.
Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with
the U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not
restricted to:
1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death.
2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods,
and availability of excess valuation coverage.
3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file
a claim or bring an action against the air carrier.
4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract.
5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to
carry.
6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to
perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air
carriers or aircraft and rerouting.
You can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S.
location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.
 You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air
carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the
right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the
applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air
carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms
is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.

NOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS
 Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that
a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed
reservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there
are not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in
accordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions
persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The
complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.

RECONFIRMATION NOTICE
Some international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations.
Contact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.

NOTICE
If the passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a
country other than the country of departure the Warsaw Convention may be
applicable and the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability
of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage
to baggage.  Se also notices headed "Advice to International Passengers on

A blind guy on a bar stool shouts to the bartender, "Hey! Wanna hear a
blonde joke?" The bar immediately becomes absolutely quiet. In a hushed voice,
the guy next to him says, "Before you tell that joke, you should know
something."
"The bartender is blond, the bouncer is blond, and I'm a 6' tall, 200 pound
blond with a black belt in karate.  What's more, the guy sitting next to me
is 6'2," weighs 225 pounds, and he's a blond weight lifter." He continues,
"The fella to your right is blond, 6'5" and pushing 300 pounds, and he's a
wrestler. Think about it seriously, Mister. You still wanna tell that
joke?"  The blind guy says, "Nah! Not if I'm gonna have to explain it five
times.

So buddy...what is up? WI am just getting ready to leave work and head home to
Denver tomorrow morning for the week. My oldest bro had a baby last week and 
my
other bro got engaged and there is a huge party for them tomorrow. i am super
excited because it fall on the long weekend. I will be skiing in Steambost 
this
weekend . However Tahoe has been getting dumped on. I am too broke to even go
skiing out here....the gas bill is Killing me. (tee hee) Actually, we do not
even turn on our heat because our place is very hard to keep warm...the hard
wood floors and the tall ceilings. As for SF.. everything is great. i love it
but I need to get a better paying job because I am broke. Oh well, I need to 
do
it while I am young and fins some rich guy. (just kidding) Anyway, How are you
doing? Any ladies strikin your fancy this valentine's day?

 Matt

 I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

 Thanks

I think we should dig up that slip that Matt Hersh gave to Max saying that
he might have been exposed to an STD and then get the photo of his cock in a

sure she has a couple fond memories for the two of them to savor throughout
their marrige.

Matt, if you're strapped for cash I could maybe send you some, but I'm
really strapped right now.  Put a bathroom in my house and I'm trying to pay
that off along with other things that are hurting me financially.  Let me
know.  I figured you were a big shot down there, I thought $500 would be
pocket change to you?

we might need to hit his parents up for some of those, this may sound gay,
but I'll bet they would like it, we could give it to them as a present, a
video slide show of Max and Jen growing up and meeting.  Their parents might
already be doing this but they did it at Josh and Lisa's (cousin) wedding
and it was cool.
