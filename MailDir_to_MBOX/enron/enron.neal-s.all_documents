Brother Butcher and I are still in need of a final list of who's in and
who's out for next weekend's Indian Guides camp-out at Brazos Bend state
park.  Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hr
away), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet other
commitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!!

To refresh your memories,  the itinerary for the weekend is get to the park
Friday after school and set up before dark.  (For those who need to go down
there later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will be
at the entrance to the park.)  Once we get there, the activities are
bicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boys
playing grab-ass in general.  THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNER
SATURDAY NIGHT,  A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT  AND
BREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.  For food purposes, we need to know an accurate
headcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help getting
your bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer
(or something).  We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lottery
tickets, ... when we get there.  Maps for those who need them will be
provided next week.

Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags,
flashlights,lanterns, etc.  Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks.
Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.  We'll make the
final call on that by Thursday.

To date, below is the headcount:

          Friday Night   Saturday Night

Fallick        ?         ?
Stehr          ?         Yes
Byrd      ?         Yes
Neal      ?         ?
Ten Have  ?         ?
Utz       No        No
Hancock   No        No
Hays      ?         ?
Daggett   ?         ?
Suchman   ?         ?
Delozier  ?         ?
Butcher        Yes       Yes
Benninger Yes       Yes

Please RSVP to me or Butch ASAP by e-mail or phone (Benninger: 713/207-1329
(w) or 713/984-1572 (h);  Butcher: 281/541-1878 (cell) or 281/497-6612 (h).

Yah-te-hay!

I think it would be a good idea for us to have one shower for everybody.  So 
I will be taking donations, so I can buy the gifts this weekend.  The gifts 
will be for Craig, Vicki and Pete.  The shower will be Tuesday @ 4:00, Eb

Thanks

Sylvia/Linda, do either of you know who on the ENA side would be responsible 
for signing an "Assignment of Gas Contract?"  HPL assigned it's expense 
contract with TXU Fuel Company to ENA, and I have the paperwork in front of 
me.  Thanks.

Subject: EOL Average Deal Count as of 1-17-01


Notes for this Week's Report:

*  North American Gas has further decreased its overall average daily EOL 
deal count to about 2,307 trades a day since November.  This is about 800 
trades a day less than the November average, but still steady growth from 
October and prior months.  The overall average daily Non-EOL deal count has 
remained very steady from about 465 to 544 trades a day since November 1999.

*  US Power has come back further and increased its average daily EOL Deal 
Count by about 70% since December, from 181 to 306 deals per day.  In 
addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count has now decreased by about 2% 
since December, from 373 to 365 deals per day.  The average daily EOL volumes 
have remained steady.

*  Northeast Power has dramatically increased its average daily EOL Deal 
Count by about 115% since December, from 59 to 126 deals per day.  In 
addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count has now decreased by about 23% 
since December, from 113 to 87 deals per day.  The average daily EOL volumes 
have remained steady.

*  UK Gas and Continental Gas have increased their overall average daily EOL 
deal count by over 50% since December.  The average daily EOL volumes have 
increased similarly as well.

*  Austrian Power has increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by 
over 5 times since December.  They had been averaging only about one to two 
trades a day since inception in April 2000.  In January 2001, their average 
is now over 5 trades per day.

Wildcats:

The Lions could only field a team of 9 players for the game Saturday and
we
have been asked to change the game time to:

Sunday, October 22 at  4:30pm

Unless there is an overwhelming negative response to the change, I will
advise
the league in the Friday morning that we will agree to the schedule
change.

So, if you are opposed to the time change please call me before 8am
Friday, at:
281.541.1878.

Thank you.

FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements 
group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk 
books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  
Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done 
soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of 
Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears 
that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed 
when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Mark

Scott,
Received your call, will get right on it.  I suspect it has to do with 
correlations, position term structure and outright price levels..  Let's see

Thanks

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

I was talking to Frank Vickers and he mentioned that you might want to talk 
about an opportunity on the trading side of the East group.  I just wanted to 
drop a note to let you know that I will be out of the office from Monday, 
Feb. 12 through Wednesday, Feb. 14.  However, I am eager to discuss any 
opportunities in trading.  Leave me a voice mail or just catch me at anytime 
on Thursday.

Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment 
Contract.  I understand her issues.  Even before she informed me of her 
decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to 
Director.  I would like to get your thoughts on this.

Hershey park

Please review the attached EnronOnline press releases which are scheduled for 
release at 10:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.  The purpose of the separate 
releases (the counterparties will make their own releases in addition) is to 
communicate the message that our goal is to continue to increase liquidity.  
One way to do that is give the greatest possible number of  buyers and 
sellers the opportunity to see our prices.

Please send any comments to me by 9:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.

I thought I might pass this along your way to see if you had any ideas or 
know of any needs. Win Graham used to work at C&L and looking for trading 
opportunities at Enron. He's not interested the associate program at this 
time.

His employer doesn't know he's looking, but feel free to pass this along to 
anyone who might have or know of a need.

>From my exposure to him, he seemed like a great guy that would probably fit 
in well at Enron. Very personable!

Hope things are going well for both of you!

Subject: Structure for Storage Loans / Deferred Payment Deals


The memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown some 
interest.  

Essentially, this deal allows an LDC to defer payment for gas and avoid 
carrying costs (which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your 
customer's bottom line).  

We have done two of these deals to date.  ENA has interest in additional 
deals (albeit not an infinite appetite) if the structure allows us to move 
them off the balance sheet.

Please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an 
interest.  

Each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds 
group.  Gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them 
through to execution.  

Please call me with any questions at x36751

Subject: ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process


The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

I've renegotiated the 400,000 MMBtu/day supply area deal on NGPL.  The 
primary delivery points have not changed. The new (receipt) paths, volumes 
and rates are below.  I'll forward the actual receipt points along with the 
amended contract once complete.  Essentially, this new structure 
significantly reduces our commodity costs to points west of 346 and slightly 
reduces (50%) commodity costs east of 346.  Please remember that secondary 
deliveries to points east of 346 (with the exception of Sonat Erath) still 
include a volumetric (demand) adder $0.02 Dth for STX receipts and $0.025 for 
all other receipts.   Deliveries to Sonat Erath will be an additional $0.02 
MMbtu.  Let me know if you have any issues ASAP.  I want to make this 
effective August 1.

East of 346

Scott,
Nice chating with you yesterday. I am in Chicago today.

It's going to be interesting if we can grow the Ag. Group for Enron on the
Grain/Oilseed side. Think I can bring good value for them from the start,
they want to go global too,

Fyi, the guys that I met where Ted Noble, Darren Maloney and also Elsa

Saludos,

Pablo

PS: Thanks for leting Elsa now my references.

Subject: ENA Adjustment at Nville

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.

Subject: NOTICE TO ALL ENRONONLINE TRADERS

Before you begin trading your EnronOnline products on March 1st ...

  Review the dates on your products.


We are in the process of converting "regular" products to "Tokenized 
Reference Period" Products.

A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as "Day 
Ahead", "Month Ahead", "Month Ahead +1", etc - but this is not what you or 
your customers see.   At midnight every night, the system checks the current 
date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For 
example, if Product #20451 is "Month+1", then on Feb. 28, the Short 
Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show "April1-30".    
However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product 
#20451 to show "May1-31".  Note that the Product number stays the same, but 
the date has automatically updated.

When all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - 
your links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product 
Numbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it 
might look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the 
same Product all the time - only the date changed).

Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your 
life easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new 
Products and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should 
continue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together.

The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have 
Rolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change 
automatically on the 1st day of each new month.  
 
For example:

Hola amigo !!!  I am already missing the Houston beers che.
Hey, we are going live on EOL here in south america.... incredible but real !
Rolo launched gas on monday and I will be coming on probably the following

In order to show potential customers how a liquid product works, could you 
tell me what product I can show them to actually reflect a moving bid/offer.

Thanks, Julian

Based on our conversation earlier tonight, attached please find the 
comparison of load and value before and after due diligence, adjusted also 
for market movement in the intervening time.

Jim, I have also attached the most recent Propane and Storage inserts for the 
Asset Agreement, since you may not have them at your home.  I hope you have a 
safe and fun travel day tomorrow and I look forward to speaking again Friday 
afternoon (or morning,  palm tree time).

Jeff/Bob, please call tomorrow after you have had a chance to review the 
inserts internally.  In addition, I would be happy to address any thoughts or 
questions you have about the load and value comparison.

Regards,
Ed

Despain, Mary Perkins

Scott,

Are we on for dinner?  I invited Scott Porter to join us - hope that is okay 
with you.  Any time from about 7:30 on is okay for me, but I would prefer 
later rather than earlier, because I have to run a few errands out in the 
direction of the Galeria after work.  Let me know.

Hey could we all get together at 5:00pm today to talk quickly about DP&L and 
the deal structure that works best for us vs. the deal structure that it 
sounds like they are willing to do. 

Stephanie, could you be sure everyone can attend- let's use my conference 
room here on 29- thanks.

We need to try and meet today to be ready for DP&L's response which should 
come tomorrow am.

Subject: ENA Adjustment at Nville

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.

Casas/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: Alagasco  

Cindy, I think we may have a few things missing.     This is what Alagasco 
shows we have regarding contract numbers and expiration dates:

There are four  old CES/ Bring cotracts which have been assigned over to 
ENA.  They are:

Bring reference number   #10170, volume of 20471 expires 12/31/00  (has 
associated demand fees)     Alagasco ref # --  ENA No. 2,  Sitara #-250042
Bring Reference number  #10055, volume of 10000 expires 11/30/00 (has 
associated demand fees)      Alagasco ref # -- ENA No. 1,   Sitare #-250050

These are the only  two contract Alagasco wants to terminatein accordance 
with the expiration date.   In additon we have two other old Bring/CES 
contracts that have expiration dates in 2001 and 2002 that  they have no 
intention of  terminating, unless however ENA would allow them to which we 
would not since they have demand fees with escalators associated with them.   
They are:

Bring reference number #10219, volume of  5339, expires 10/31/01  (has 
associated demand fees)     Algasco ref # -- ENA No. 3, Sitare #250196
        Please note that in the system we have the termination date is 
correct but the volume is incorrect.  It reflects 10,000 and you can see that 
the date ranges have been split  each monthby  Joe Casas, whom  changes the 
volume in the scheduled section to 6,045 to account for fuel and what 
Alagasco is actually taking.  This needs to be corrected.     .Again, 
Alagasco has no intention of terminating this contract.

Bring reference number #10326,  volume of 10,000 during the winter only, 
months Nov - March , (has associated demand fees)  Algasco ref # -- ENA No.4
This deals expires October 31, 2002.  Sitara # --250186       This is the 
contract that allows Alagasco swing rights in which they have yet to 
exercise. 
AT one point Scott Neal had mentioned to try to work on taking this swing 
language out of the contract but I have not mentioned anything to them since 
they have yet to exercise  those swing rights and I did not want to bring it 
to there attention.    I do not know how much the demand fees are on this 
cotnract , but I would assume they are signficant.

Alagasco has sent  two termination letters to cancel the first two above 
contracts, only.  i.e.-- Bring ref #'s  10170 & 10055.    ENA does reflect 
these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate 
these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two 
termination letters Alagasco sent us.   In additon, the two seasonal 
contracts that were done in Apirl & May 00  between Roger and myself, Sitara 
deals 242653 & 271301; Algasco  would like to tie these contracts  to the 
newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agree with.

All deals look accurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare 
# 250196, which I mentioned above.  I do not know the demand fees associated 
with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system accurately or 
if they are being billed accurately.

Cindy, I think this information should be everything we need to clear up the 
confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton letter.    Please get with 
me once you have a minute.    Thank you.

The first invoice for $5.4 million went out a couple of weeks ago.  CES came 
back to us and said they were not going to pay.  They claimed that the total 
of all of the invoices to this date that they have already paid had covered 
that amount.  I have researched all of their invoices, and it looks like 
there was a demand invoice in the system for the month of June for 
approximately $6 million to much.  CES incorporated a credit for that invoice 
in with the charge for $5.4 million, netting out to approximately $600,000.  
I am meeting with CES on Thursday to see if we are in agreement.  The other 
invoice for $7.5 million was sent out last week, CES is in agreement and the 
payment should be here shortly.
   If you have any questions don't hesitate to call me.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

The state of NJ has an RFP out for 7 months supply beginning Dec 1,2000. The 
volumes are as follows
All deliveries to City Gate: 
( Total Volume for 7 months -Therms)
FT
NJ Nat Gas: 1,070,845
Elizabethtown; 179,955
PSE&G: 7,592,092
South Jersey:325,842
 
IT(LDC)
PSEG; 251,814
South Jersey;728,801

The mandatory bid meeting was this morning. I asked the guys in the NJ EES 
office to attend. We are meeting tomorrow to discuss this and the rest of the 
state's needs (Up to 5 contracts /day). This RFP is very small, but there are 
bigger rfp's to come. Furthermore, NJ transit is also bidding ga and  is 
considering long-term supplies (5 - 10 yrs) as an alternative to the current 
high one year prices. I will keep everyone informed as this progresses.

Thanks

several thousand dollars in unused tickets. A $75.00 airline re-booking  fee
will be charged in addition to the cost of the flight selected. This ticket
must be booked and used within the next 12 months.

Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
    Pipeline Power Partners
    10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
    Houston, Texas 77024
    713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some
of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94.
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had
tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well
Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we
had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it
upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap
pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now
have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a
contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.

Conrad

Janet,

Colleen Sullivan has replaced Kate Fraser in the team to finalize the 
negotiations
with the folks at Keyspan.  My intention is to finish up the calculations 
that Colleen 
has requested over the next few days so that she can get a feel for the 
offsets that
occur in the proxy pricing given certain decisions.  We will then be able to 
finish up
with Keyspan.  Hopefully, Ed Anderson and Melissa Reges will not be taking any
more vacations for a while.

Colleen has talked to Scott about internally releasing East Origination 
Group's cut of
the accrual profits for Year 2 of the asset management deal.  There should 
not be a
be a problem doing this before the end of the quarter.

Sorry for the delay,

Ruth

If so, let's finalize the internal dollar true-ups now. If not, please set up

Scott, I would like to sue Kim in an expanded role within the group. She will 
still be responsible for all of her current activities but will also work 
with the group on Pipeline postings and expansions, RFP and information 
responses, Development of Presentations, etc.  I think that in the long run 
she can develop and be moved into other positions.  Especially after she 
earns her degree.  I have spoken with HR.  We will monitor to assure that she 
does not let any of her curent responsibilities slide.  Let me know if you 
have and concerns.


Also, I have completed the Performance plan for John Hodge ( Required due to 
his ranking in 2000).  I will leave a copy on your desk for review and 
execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.

This is awsome and at the same time rather chilling.  Mother nature is
spectacular
This awesome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was
working while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so he
should
at least be recognized as the photographer of this once in a lifetime
shot

I have prepared  a recommendation letter as  you have requested.  It is my 
pleasure to do so.  Please advise as to when to send, etc.  I am available to 
visit on the phone any time after 2:3opm any day this week.  However, I will 
be out of the office on Thursday and Friday Nov. 16-17.

Subject: Request for a short phone call

Scott:

I hope that all is well.  India is still going strong with additional 
involvement in commodity trading (electricity, fuels...etc.)  

Please advice of the best time to phone you this week to seek your help in 
reference to compiling letters of recommendation for the Green Card 
application.  The application, supported by Enron, will be under the "Alien 
of Extraordinary Ability" Category.   I am sure that your recommendation will 
go a very long way and I am hopeful that you will agree to help.  

I am enclosing the email I received from the lawyer and the sample letter 
suggested. I am trying to highlight--where the lawyer indicated--the attempts 
to safeguard and promote US investment in Argentina,  the rapport I had with 
the various echelons of authority in that country, and shed light on 
character and ability.  Please feel free to add/delete as you see fit and 
advice of any comments and/or suggestions.    

Needless to say, and regardless of outcome, I really appreciate your help and 
advice.  


Best regards

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the 
Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September 
of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly 
speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in 
December of '70.  

By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  
February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high 
of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 
the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the 
Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and 
geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking 
openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom

And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its 
way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were 
wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

Executive Impact & Influence Program
* IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Do Not Delete *

An essential element of the Executive Impact and
Influence Program is the feedback, which will be
provided to you by others in the organization.

The Team Selection process allows you to identify those
people from whom you wish to receive feedback (i.e.,
your immediate Manager, each Direct Report, and
Colleagues/Peers).  Please keep in mind that the most
pertinent feedback will come from people with whom you
interact on a regular and frequent basis.

It will also be important for you to request feedback
from all your direct reports, at least five or six
colleagues/peers, and your immediate boss(s).  If you
do not get feedback from AT LEAST three direct reports
and three colleagues/peers, those two groups will be
combined in your feedback report.

Team Selection and subsequent feedback collection are
now being administered primarily via the Internet.
After you have completed the Team Selection process,
each of your raters will receive an email with an
Internet address and password to go online and submit
feedback for you.

It is important that you complete your Team Selection
NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS on Tuesday, October 3.

To begin the Team Selection process, you will need the
following Internet address and Password.

Open your Internet browser e.g., Internet Explorer or
Netscape Navigator, and please type or copy the URL
address below into your Internet browser (please DO NOT
go through Lotus Notes):

www.fsddatasvc.com/enron/register.html

Your Password is:  EKCX8H

If you experience technical problems, please call
Dennis Ward at FSD Data Services in Houston, Texas at
713-942-8436.  If you have any questions about this
process, you may contact Debbie Nowak at Enron,
713-853-3304, or Christi Smith at Keilty, Goldsmith &
Company, 858-450-2554.

Thank you for your participation.

Kimberly,

Please see if Scott will be able to meet with some Howard finance professor's 
on January 25, 2001.  The latest appointment in the evening will work if it 
is at all possible for Scott to meet during that time.  If I can even get 30 
minutes I would be greatly indebted to you and Scott forever.  If not, is 
there anyone else on the trading floor able to give me some time.

Please advise as soon as possible?

Thanks, Geynille

Deskheads:

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, 
receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be 
charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the 
administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 
being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the 
session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that 
day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time 
permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

Hello everyone!
Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already 
that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will 
no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams.  I am moving 
over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams.  
Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement.  She can be reached at X3-3131 
and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs 
immediately.
I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her 
with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while.  Please forward 
this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.

It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.

Thanks,
Edie

The guy in B.A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541 
14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45 
minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's 
name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights 
lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We 
aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. 
shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of 
fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the 
heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from 
Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour.

You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated 
with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful.  
Don't hesitate
to call if have nay questions.

Subject: re: ARGENTINA DOVE HUNT



I talked to Scott Neal - he lived in BA for a few years and has attended and
hosted bird hunts.  He is going to get me the names of some people he hunted
with to compare prices, accommodations etc.  A few things he wanted us to
check on;
 1) BA is a hell of a long way to travel - is the flight bus. class?
 2) What time of year are you planning on going - there are better times.
Scott was thinking they hunted in May (he is going to check) and had as much
shooting (and then some) as he needed.
 3) Accommodations in BA and where you hunt.  Again he is going to verify and
get some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting
(not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking he
stayed at the Gauge Four Seasons.
I will get back to you with more details as I have them.
Thanks, Lee - 713-624-9065 (lhanse@br-inc.com)

From: "Boyd, Bruce" <Bruce_Boyd@kindermorgan.com>, on 2/11/2001 11:11 AM:

Are you up for a hunting trip of a lifetime?

Pawpaw and I met with an outfitter last week to discuss details of a dove
hunting trip in Argentina. In a nutshell, the trip includes six (6) shoots
(i.e. half day hunts) near the town of Cordoba, Argentina. As Jody can
attest, there is no limit and you can shoot 400 to 1000 birds per day
depending on how mad you are at them!

I have estimated the total cost of the trip at $5,000. This price includes
the following:

3 nights & 4 days (6 shoots) @ $2,295 (at Presidential Estancia)
Roundtrip airfare (Houston-Miami-Buenos Aires-Cordoba) @ $1,000 (could be as
low as $800)
Shells ($9.75 per box) @ $1,000 (based on 320 birds per shoot...75% kill
average)
Gun permits, bird boys, entertainment in Buenos Aires, etc. @ $705

We need at least 4 to book a separate trip. Argentina's seasons are opposite
from ours and the best time to go is August - October. A smaller group will
be booked to go with an other group.

I know all of you boys got huge 2000 bonuses...so what's a paltry $5 large
for a trip like this?

Let me know if you are interested in going with us so we can start looking
at dates. If you have any questions call Pawpaw or myself. See ya.

Nelson,

I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the 
Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they 
will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.  

sitara #778201

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central 
gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.


Thanks,

Kam

Subject: CAMBRIDGE ENERGY UPDATES ON GAS AND POWER

The  CERA  executive roundtable meeting  summary  results are as  follows:
If you are interested  in  a complete  set  of  the graphs from the  
presentations  please  let me know.

ELECTRIC POWER  PART  ONE
PEAK  TRENDS
It is  noteworthy how  rapidly volatility can change geographically in the 
electric  markets.  Last  year  the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were  the 
peakiest,  but   it reversed  this year  with  the  West  being highest  at 
the peaks  and in New England --  but only   in early May 2000 were  hgih 
peaks  apparent  there.

Demand  can vary from half the peak max  to the max.  Peakers  can be on the 
margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets.  We need to 
watch  gas prices  this  winter  as they can effect  winter peak power 
prices--not  just a  summer phenomenon.

Where  are  the most gas plants  now on the margin?  Ercot, FRCC, Neepool, 
NYPP, SERC, WSCC

A  DISCONNECT
There  is  a disconnect  in the on-peak forward market price for power in 
Texas now; with the  added  5 GW  Texas forward markets  do not seem to   
take this  into account yet.  (Note:  Vince Kaminski) The  Texas forward  
market  should be  very soft  next summer  unless  we return to  105 degree 
F  temperatures.    New England  is  just one year behind  Texas  in its 
overbuild.

One main  reason for the  spikes  in Calif  is   power plants  did not  get  
built in Calif   due  to  a lack of  a capacity  charge ..and  this is not a 
panacea...as Calif also  has  many  enviro/siting  hurdles  that challenge  
developers  who want to site as well.  

  .

TSUNAMI OF  MERCHANT  CAPACITY PLANNED?
CERA   sees  over  240,000  MW  of planned  capacity over  the  2000-2005 
period;  with   25,000 MW  being  completed  in  2000;  35 MW under 
construction  for   2001 and 15 000 MW under  construction for   2002--  but  
the market  only needing   13 000  to  15 000 MW  a year.   This   shall  
lead  to  many  and large deferrals and  delays, especially in  2001  and 
2002.  What  has  been the recent  history?   US  wide  over the
past  3 years  just  11 percent of the planned  capacity  was  actually 
finished  and   18 percent  of that planned  was  actually  under 
construction.  They  assume  a  24 month  construction completion  time.

FOR PROFIT  TRANSMISSION
Cera   sees  Allegheny Energy  in PJM West;  Entergy in SPP;  Southern  in 
SERC  and Alliant  in MAPP  as all for profit transcos.
TYPICAL   O&M COSTS  IN U.S.  TRANSCOS
 Why  do  O&M  costs   differ  widely  among  transcos?  Some  costs  are  3  
to 8 times higher  than the norm  at 
$5000 in O&M expense  per 5000  system  miles  in size.  Regulatory  
overhang  allows  this...this is  weather  adjusted  to remove  high  costs  
from  big  freezes  etc.

USING REAL OPTION MODEL  VS  POWER PLANT  NPV
You  want to  try to have  the base value of  an asset  going  forward  when 
you expect volatility  and include  historical  spreads  and  fuel/power  
price  swing  assumptions.

CALIFORNIA  MARKET IS BROKEN
This market  starts  to  work  only after it   gets into  a reliability 
crisis.  No incentives  to add power  plant  capacity  and
huge hurdles   against  siting   even when the market  signals the  need is  
there.  Will the  regulator's post 2000  fix  make it  worse?

PEAK POWER  DEMAND  FORECAST
As  percent  per year  change  vs   2000  Cera  sees   2001  as follows:
New Eng  / New York 6.3 /  6.2  percent
PJM / ECAR   7.7 / 4.4 percent
MAIN /  MAPP    3.0 /   -0.1
SERC /  FRCC   1.3 /  2.3  percent
SPP /  ERCOT    4.0  /  2.3
NWPP /  Rockies     -6.8  /  -0.6
AZNM /  Calif-SoNV   -0.9   /   4.0
USA  avg    up  2.6  percent   It  looks  like Calif. in in for a   touch 
summer  in 2001  as well.


NATURAL  GAS  PART   TWO
SUPPLY  SHORT
Year   2001  supply  rebound could  be  800mmcfd   to 1.0  bcfd;  Canada   in 
2001  up only  400  a  day; in the US  we  need   2  bcfd  more supply  for  
2001  demand.  alone  let alone  storage   refill.... yet  a
cold winter  now  could   add   3  to 4  bcfd  to demand  and slash  
storages.  The  fall in drilling  in 1999  and early  2000  took   3.5  bcfd 
productive  capacity out of the  supply pool.  It  will  take  till  2005  
for US production to  reach a 4.1 bcfd  gain versus  today's production.

ADDED  GAS  FOR POWER PLANTS
Right now  Cera  expects  an incremental  need for   1  bcfd  next year for 
these plants..this will  keep prices  high

MUCH MORE POWER SWING
1990 to 1992  we needed   5  bcfd  for power plant  swings;   now  we need   
10  bcfd;  offpeak use is  even up  5  bcfd vs  10 years  ago.

RESI  USE  IS UP
The  AGA  disco members   adds   750 000 new gas   homes  each year  and 
this  builds  demand  year   round.

INDUSTRIAL   NUG  DEMAND
Of  the   24  bcfd ( 8.77 Tcf) industrials  gas use  in the US;     8.6  
bcfd   (  3.1  Tcf) of this  is for  power plant  and non-mfg  use.

HOW  FAST  CAN CANADA  ADD?
Canada  can add   3.6  bcfd   by  2005   versus  now;   adding  each year 
from  2001 to 2005 as follows:  500/800/900/700/700  mcfd annually.

IS  ARCTIC  GAS  ON THE HORIZON?
Its  is  far away;   maybe   4  or  5  bcfd  by  2015..  This  means  up  to  
2.7  bcfd  to  flow  to Midwest  by 2015  and up  to  2.4  bcfd  to 
Calif./PNW   on expansions  by  2015.

Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of 
operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and 
is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth 
of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very 
high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial 
area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve 
our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..

Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of 
operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to 
operations/logistics.   I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to 
make decisions.   Very little commercial understanding, although shows 
interest in learning.

Brian,

There would be more interest in Eagan as opposed to Moss Bluff.  Moss Bluff 
is connected to the A/s line but the interconnect is controlled by Channel or 
TPC and generally is not a reliable Firm Service point..  We have looked into 
building our own interconnect in the past with a cost of around $2 million if 
my memory serves me right.  At that price I would much rather have Centana 
Stg Vs Moss Bluff.

I talked to Scott Neal about Eagan and he asked to be included in any 
discussions.

As far as the value of the capacity that will depend on the injection rate, 
storage capacity and withdrawal rate as well as what pipelines are involved.  
As a general idea I would say Moss Bluff is worth between $.84 - $1.44 and 
Eagan $1.20 - $2.00.  This can be further defined when Paul stops by.

The value of the information issue should be addressed to Scott Neal and Tom 
Martin.

Jim,

Market Hub Partners is interested in selling the Moss Bluff and Eagan storage 
facilities in addition to several properties under development.  Our initial 
view is that a generator such as Calpine or AEP will bid these assets beyond 
their fair value.  Nevertheless, we would like to visit the data room to 
understand the commercial and operational aspects of these assets.

Three questions:
1. Are you at all interested in these assets?
2. What price would you be willing to pay for capacity in these assets say 
for a (1, 3 and 5 year term).
3. Is the information value from these assets worth anything?

Paul Bienawski will stop by to brief you on the contents of the info memo we 
received (summarized below).

Thanks,
Brian

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal 
(2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and 
locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you 
have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge 
deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  
Sorry for the trouble.

Hello LSU Team!!!

As you know, we will be conducting summer intern interviews on March 15th and 
16th.  We did not have the opportunity due to conflicting schedules in the 
Fall to have a cultivation dinner.  I am scheduling a dinner for the Full 
time candidates on March 15th around 7:00 PM to have this dinner.

If anyone's schedule permits other than the scheduled interviewers and 
greeters to attend please let me know.

Thanks a million!!!

Subject: orgination

as i discussed today listed below is the trade that i would like orgination 
granted on and a summary of the other 
deal i spoke with you about.

bought 5000 dracut from hydroquebec sitara deal number 610884  purchase price 
$6.10 
sold      5000 dracut from conn nat           sitara deal number 610959   
sell price            $6.45
                                                                       
orgination  $1750


additionally on a daily basis i attempt  to market  the tenn zone 5 above the 
cng bid.
usually with success.
the production costs roughly 28 cents at current prices to move to cng.
today the cng two way  was 6.51 by 6.55.  i sold 5800  at $6.48 which is a 
$6.76 cng equivalent or
.25 over the cng bid   or $1450   

i can't try to forward sell this gas because we don't know on a forward basis 
if we are going to have this gas.
i assume that this position would go into the cng position when the books are 
broken out and i can't imagine that
scott will have the time try to market it.  thus if i am spending a 
considerable amount of time in the morning trying to add 
value to the desk with the illiquid assets that we have and i am successful, 
then i feel that signficant quantifiable contributions 
made to the desk should be recognized.

This is very kind of you and I really appreciate it very much.  I shall phone 
you to thank you on behalf of my family and myself as a stop gap measure till 
I am back from India by 1st week of December to thank you in person.

The lawyer has asked me to compile all the letters, thus kindly send it by 
internal mail to Amr Ibrahim, EB4737B.  Finally, strange as it might sound, 
the lawyer has spelled my first name in the letter wrongly as "Amir", and I 
wonder if there is still time to correct it to "Amr" without the "i".  If 
this is a bit late, then it is fine as it stands.  

Once more, thank you very, and I really appreciate it.

Very best regards

Scott:

I hope that all is well.  India is still going strong with additional 
involvement in commodity trading (electricity, fuels...etc.)  

Please advice of the best time to phone you this week to seek your help in 
reference to compiling letters of recommendation for the Green Card 
application.  The application, supported by Enron, will be under the "Alien 
of Extraordinary Ability" Category.   I am sure that your recommendation will 
go a very long way and I am hopeful that you will agree to help.  

I am enclosing the email I received from the lawyer and the sample letter 
suggested. I am trying to highlight--where the lawyer indicated--the attempts 
to safeguard and promote US investment in Argentina,  the rapport I had with 
the various echelons of authority in that country, and shed light on 
character and ability.  Please feel free to add/delete as you see fit and 
advice of any comments and/or suggestions.    

Needless to say, and regardless of outcome, I really appreciate your help and 
advice.

I'm planning to clean out the garage this Saturday morning starting about 9
a.m. It would be great if you two could help me sort through the things and
help decide what is give away, throw away, or take to the Farm. It shouldn't
take too long. Bill is coming in about noon at Hobby and I will pick him up.
We plan to try and finish the inside of the house that afternoon. Let me
know if you can help. Thanks.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=

the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=

the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=

the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=

businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=

CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=

operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=

for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20

President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=

the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=

EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=

Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=

services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=

of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=

Hi Rolo,

I am glad to hear from you.  Yes, Sao Paulo is muy grande con muchos 
macacos.  Everything is going fine here.  Do you have any trips to the US 
planned?  I have not be playing much golf, too cold and rainy here so far 
this winter, but spring is near.

Stay in touch and good luck.

Hey, just wanted to say hi to you. 
I moved to SP 10 days ago. Very exiting city, don't you think so? Not many 
places to play golf here, but I will have to look better. Are you playing??
How are things going there? How is your desk doing this year? Things are 
difficult in the region - I believe you are aware of it - but as usual, we 
are trying hard.

Well, just wanted to let you know thta I am in SP now, working for Remi 
Collonges.

Lets keep in touch.

Rolo

Natural Gas for a total of 232,500 mmbtu's at index plus .0050.   Total 
Delivery exposure is roughly $1.2MM.  A Letter of Credit has been required 
for this trade.

Veronica Espinoza had a conversation with Dan within the past month, 
explicitly stating our credit concern for this counterparty and told Dan not 
to trade with the counterparty unless it was approved by Credit.  The 
counterparty was added to the Credit Watch List after this conversation last

Forward to FL distribution list.

Note:  The Florida legislative session ends May 4.  It is highly unlikely 
that any action will be taken on wholesale electric deregulation this 
session. 

I spoke to a staff member of the House Utility and Telecommunication 
Committee yesterday and she informed me that they are starting the process 
for an interim legislative study to expand on the interim report prepared by 
the 2020 Study Commission (specifically the "stranded benefits" issue).

The IT guy said I need one of the following
1.  New super duper computer
2.  More memory, my computer has 128meg of ram
3.  Run my applications on 2 cmputers like mine instead of one.

John--Attached is an update of the values in the various transport books as 
of October 3rd.  Please note that the East Desk has already made its 
changes.  All that was done was to move the correlations up--the old 
percentage and new percentage of each deal is shown on the sheet.  I am 
waiting on a deal by deal breakdown of extrinsic value changes, but I have 
been told that the change in total for the East Desk was ($5,900,000).  They 
brought this in at the same time they cleared out the $5,700,000 positive 
that had been withheld, resulting in about a ($200,000) change.  Please let 
me know if you disagree with any of the changes that were made and we will 
fix them.  They really did not seem very controversial since these were all 
Columbia Gulf transports and the correlations were just set too low.

The West Desk's proposal on PGT/Kingsgate is also shown on the worksheet.  
After speaking with the Canadian office on forward AECO basis, Phillip and 
Keith believe the Kingsgate / Malin spread should be widened considerably.  
At this time they are proposing moving the current spread from $.1676 to 
$.2676, and moving the correlations up to the point that results in a 
$.0303/MMBtu extrinsic value number.  They believe this would put the values 
in the appropriate places, and would result in very little net impact overall 
to their books.  As of yesterday's close, the impact would be a positive 
$55,301 change.  No changes will be made until you approve it.


Regarding the Central Region, I have not spoken with or received anything 
from Hunter and Andy yet.  Neither one of them is here today but I will get 
with them as soon as I can to let you know the Central Region's proposal.  
You can at least see where they stood as of October 3rd for what is on the 
books.  I have not included Geoff Storey's capacity deals on this sheet since 
his have no extrinsic value, but I will be happy to add them if you need that 
info.

Ed -apparently CNG gave VNG an interstate pipeline rebate 
of about $300,000 but it's gotten hung up in the asset management stuff - VNG 
really needs to get its hands on that $ and make a filing at the VSCC to 
refund it - while the dollars are small, from a regulatory perspective, the 
VSCC is putting a bit of heat on VNG to make this refund happen - could you 
talk to your guys next week as I suspect the refund came to Enron since you 
pay the pipeline bills

Todd,

I am available for fishing with you on Sept.8. On the 8 Sept. when you
arrive, I will take you to fish and we can discuss what type of deep fishing
you want. It is no problem getting a guide if I can not take you deep
fishing. This is a slow season and a lot of tour guides are available. You
do not need to bring any equipment. We have any kind you need. Are you
staying at Holiday Hotel ? I will speak to you on the day of your arrival.
Hope to see you soon.

I'll pay you Friday night.  I think we're going to dinner together.  Let me 
know if you need it earlier.

How's everything going?

Next time you get a chance, I need you to send me $200 to cover the deposit I 
put down on the fishing trip.

Thanks

Scott,

Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent 
me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted 
to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her 
a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in 
most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.  Thanks, I 
appreciate it.

Steve

Gypsy Kings concert in the Woodlands Saturday night and Mary and I wanted to 
see if you and Carol wanted to join us.  I've been working till 2:00 in the 
morning the last few nights so have waited way too late to invite you.  Sorry 
for that.  But try to let me know ASAP if you can go.

while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20

Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =

We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to hav=

small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=

before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=

more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=

We have become aware that brokers are currently obtaining guest ID's from our 
customers and are using EnronOnline as a price discovery mechanism. This 
obviously does not benefit Enron as no transactions are generated  and 
consumes considerable systems resources. In order to curb this practice and 
to generate revenue we  are currently exploring the possibility of offering 
Brokers and the Press non- transactable guest ID access to EnronOnline for a 
fee. Please let us know if you have any concerns , comments or feedback 
regarding this issue. Thank You.

Tod, Scott,

I would like to set up a time when the three of us can meet to discuss my 
mid-year review.  I was told by HR that I was to initiate the dialogue and 
get the process rolling.  Let me know when you will be available.  I would 
like to meet sometime within the next two weeks.

Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at 
Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, 
within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 
MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we 
use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and 
update it daily?

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile

Unnatural  History


After the last two horrible quarters, many of  us are probably telling 
ourselves that it can't get much worse than it's been.  For those of us who 
believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little 
history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.

For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  
pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has 
had  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's 
fairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent 
commentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.

Over the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has 
been, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 
1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.

There were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. 
There were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single 
six-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an 
astonishing 52.92%.

Of the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 
1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very 
worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the 
wake of the stock market crash of 1929.  

The worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the 
one ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 
1970s. 

The most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the 
one ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the 
1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month 
period. 

This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  
means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time 
it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 
has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 
years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. 

It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went 
down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an 
additional 18.24%. 

Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 
chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course 
the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things 
getting  better. 

But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six 
months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the 
coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the 
last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  
If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  
left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. 

History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  
day).

Western Spot Power Prices Sink Amid River Runoff, Mild Weather

     Portland, Oregon, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western U.S.
peak spot power prices for delivery tomorrow plummeted as
hydroelectric operators were forced to generate power, traders
said.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
declined 38.4 percent from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$140.55 a megawatt hour, with executed trades between $135.00-
$150.00.
     "Run-off is increasing hydroelectric supplies," said one
Northwest trader.
     Traders said that smaller dams in the Portland area don't
have the capability to store excess water from mountain snowmelt,
so they have to generate power or spill water.
     "The weather is mild in the Northwest, causing snow melt to
run off into the reservoirs," said one Northwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Portland, Oregon were expected to
reach 63 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 65 degrees.
     At the California Oregon Border, day-ahead peak power sank
$106.67 to a Bloomberg index of $140.00. Traders completed trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.
     In the Pacific Northwest, federal power marketer Bonneville
Power Administration offered up to 200 megawatts of delivered
energy for tomorrow at the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia and California-
Oregon Border firm electricity index price.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power slipped
$72.20, to a Bloomberg index of $150.92 as traders executed
transactions in the $140.50-$150.00 range. Traders said they sold
off-peak power as low as $21.00 and as high as $40.00.
     Traders said that Arizona Public Service Co.'s 1,270-
megawatt Palo Verde 1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona,
increased production 20 percent from yesterday to 70 percent of
capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage
that began March 31.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power slumped $73.33 to a Bloomberg index of $139.67 amid trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.

Northeast Spot Power Prices Steady Amid Idle Market Conditions

     Philadelphia, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot power prices
in the Northeast U.S. were little changed this morning, amid
expectations for continued increases in available generation and
stagnant cooling loads, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demands 89 and 97 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Thursday delivery was assessed 65 cents
higher, at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $33.80 per
megawatt hour.
     Traders said tomorrow's projected load requirements and
generation outages were virtually unchanged, leaving little room
for movement in the day-ahead market.
     The Interconnection projected loads for the first six on-peak
hours of tomorrow to average just 100 megawatts greater than
today, and increases in available generation were estimated at
only 23 megawatts.
     The next-week market was volatile however, as revised weather
forecasts, calling for cooler temperatures, left many marketers
scrambling to readjust positions.
     "The weather forecast for next-week has been drastically
revised," said one PJM-based trader. "Anyone holding excess power
for that period was looking to unload it this morning, and the
market just fell out of bed from there."
     Traders said early morning trades topped out at $48.00,
before trailing off to lows in the $40.00-$41.00 range.
     In the New England Power Pool, day-ahead power sold 25 cents
lower amid trades in the $51.50-$52.50 range, with most deals
executed at $52.00.
     Entergy Corp. said it began the process of restarting its
670-megawatt Pilgrim 1 nuclear reactor at 3:07 a.m., although
traders agreed the additional megawatts didn't affect tomorrow's
market.
     "It's not a very big unit, so a minimal increase in
production isn't going to make a noticeable difference," said one
Northeast trader. "I'm sure it will be reflected in tomorrow's
day-ahead market, when output will be closer to capacity."
     Next-week packages traded heavily in New England, as they did
in PJM, though prices for the 5-day block there remained firm at
$55.00. Traders said heavy purchases from one of the region's load
serving entities might have helped support the market, by
offsetting forecasts for cooler temperatures.
     Temperatures in Boston, one of New England's primary load
centers, are forecast to average less than 60 degrees through the
early part of next week.

Southeast Demand Again Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Continued high
weather-related demand from the Southeast and a combination of
unit outages and transmission problems in the Midwest drove Mid-
Continent peak power prices up again today, traders said.
     East Central Area Reliability Council prices rose for the
fourth consecutive day as heavy weather-related demand from the
Tennessee Valley Authority grid continued, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for day-ahead power delivered into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $6.11
to $46.25 a megawatt-hour and has gained almost $19.00 this week.
Trades ranged from $44.50 up to $50.00 after options expiration.
     Cinergy traders said the late price rise came as marketers
oversold to TVA and had to buy power back from there to cover
short positions.
     In contrast to the daily market, short-term over-the-counter
prices dropped, with power for Friday delivery offered $2.00 less
than yesterday's price for Thursday-Friday parcels at $41.00 and
power for delivery from May 21-25 offered $7.00 less at $40.50.
     "There's a new weather forecast out, and it's going to be a
lot cooler next week now than we originally thought," one trader
said. "I wish I'd sold myself way short on the next week package
yesterday, but what can you do?"
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $2.46 higher on
average at $40.00-$46.00 and power in the lower half of the
region $2.79 higher on average at $46.00-$52.00.
     MAIN traders said transmission constraints all but
eliminated the ability to sell power west into the Mid-Continent
Area Power Pool, causing market focus to shift to the South and
East.
     With several unit outages and transmission problems,
continued hot weather and imports from MAIN unavailable, day-
ahead power prices in MAPP were the highest in the region again
today, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $1.00 higher on average in northern MAPP
at $50.00-$55.00 and 33 cents higher in the southern half of the
region at $50.00-$55.00. Traders said activity was limited, as
most utilities had no excess power available.
     "It's still in the 80s (degrees) here, which is much hotter
than we're used to this early in the year," one trader said. "Add
to that these unit outages, and you get what we have right now; a
pretty big mess."

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Recent Heat Moderates

     Atlanta, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as several major regional
population centers expected cooler weather tomorrow, while
others expected weather to remain hot, utility traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose an average of 39 cents a megawatt-
hour from equivalent trades made yesterday for delivery today,
to $47.77, amid trades in the $36.50-$60.00 range.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 87 degrees Fahrenheit,
unchanged from today's projected high.
     In sections of the Southwest Power Pool, tomorrow's
projected highs for Topeka, Kansas, were expected to decline to
the high-70s to low-80s tomorrow, utility traders said.
     "There was not a lot of trading done in the next-day
markets because we expect to see a break in the weather," said
one SPP-based utility trader. "Our temperatures, which are
expected to hit the 92-94 degree mark today, will decline to
about 10 degrees below normal tomorrow."
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about normal over the next week.
     Over the next 6-10 days, temperatures in the Southeast are
expected to average 3.1 degrees below normal, the forecaster
said.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power for tomorrow
traded in a "broad" range of $40.00-$53.00, though the majority
of energy trades were reported at a Bloomberg index of $44.57,
24 cents more than yesterday.
     Expectations for continued warm weather on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and troubling transmission line loading relief measures
between sections of southern Mid-Continent Area Power Pool and
the northern SPP, kept Entergy Corp. prices from falling,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg day-ahead peak Entergy index fell 2 cents
from yesterday to $49.73 amid trades in the $45.00-$55.00
range.
     Traders said prices could dip tomorrow in the Gulf Coast
region because natural gas futures for June delivery on the New
York Mercantile Exchange were slipping. June futures declined
28.3 cents per million British thermal units to $4.38 per
million Btu.

U.K. Winter Power Contracts Little Changed in Heavy Trade

     London, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Winter 2001 power prices
in the U.K. closed little changed today, although the contract was
unusually active, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload was last assessed 10 pence lower at
21.30-21.40 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Although Winter 2001 traded over 60 times, one trader said
the contract traded "range-bound'' throughout the day, as
participants purchased and sold the contract in an effort to
create liquidity in the market.
     "Its unprecedented for over 800 megawatts to have traded and
we've seen little change. It's evident a player out there is very
keen to get liquidity going in the market,'' another trader said.
     Traders said the two major trading houses that have been
trading the contract aggressively over the past week were the main
market participants again today.
     Day-ahead prices tumbled today even though reports of outage
problems persisted, traders said.
     British Energy's Sizewell B nuclear plant was reported to
have shut for maintenance last Friday because of an acid leak,
although this couldn't be confirmed.
     "The spot market continued to be volatile. We are still
seeing a lot of panic buying and selling,'' one trader said. "It
seems people must have overbought in preparation for these planned
outages and now need to sell.''
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 23.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, before plummeting to trade at 18.00 pounds a megawatt-hour,
5.00 pounds lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

Scott,

Yesterday, I received a phone call from Scott Goodell regarding his vacation 
balance.  He and his assistant thought the was a mistake in his vacation 
accrual.  I have researched the issue with the payroll department and the SAP 
team and they see an inconsistency in his account.  

However, Scott says that he was given 3 weeks vacation (120 hours) as part of 
the CES acquisition.  His offer letter does not state the 120 hours up front, 
but we can add this to his balance and correct the problem, if you approve.  
I know he has contacted several people to resolve this, so I'd like to get 
back to him as soon as possible.

Let me know if this is OK,

Thanks,
Jennifer

Subject: Emissions Strategy Meeting....

PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR AVAILABILITY!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy 
Meeting" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate 
change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the 
potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 12 
p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can 
finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have 
any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to 
contact me of Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.

Subj:    Montana Forest Fire picture
This is awsome and at the same time rather chilling.  Mother nature is
spectacular
This awesome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was
working while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so he
should
at least be recognized as the photographer of this once in a lifetime
shot

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and 
Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to 
have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in 
Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your 
reference.

thanks,

Scott

Subject: Closure Required - Mid Year PRC Results for Associates & Analysts

I recently joined the Associate and Analyst Program Management Team as 
Director of Career Development.   Celeste Roberts, who handled many facets of 
the Associate and Analyst Program will now focus primarily on Recruiting.  I 
am responsible for staffing, rotation management, and performance management 
reporting directly to Charlene Jackson.   Going forward, I will partner with 
the PRC Representatives and Human Resources to work through our mid-year and 
year-end performance management process.   

There are just a few remaining tasks necessary in order to bring our mid-year 
effort to a close.  As we are getting inquiries from Supervisors, Associates 
and Analysts regarding mid year ratings, we strongly encourage you to 
communicate final ratings to the Supervisors by no later than Friday, August 
11, 2000.    As was discussed in the PRC meetings in July, Managers have been 
given until September 15 to conduct performance reviews.    If you need our 
assistance in communicating information to the Supervisors, please let me 
know and we will provide ratings where requested on your behalf.

Additionally, as we introduced a new process during our mid year review 
efforts, it is crucial that we solicit your feedback.   To assist in this 
effort, we have identified an Associate and Analyst PRC Project Team.    
Please look for an evaluation form via email in the next several weeks that 
requests feedback on how well we delivered our mid year process and how we 
might improve.  We our counting on your partnership and candid feedback.   

Once again, the Associate and Analyst Program Management Team would like to 
thank you for your involvement in the performance review process.  I can be 
reached at 713-853-7351.  My assistant is Constance Charles and she can be 
reached at 713-853-5614.  I look forward to working with each of you.

It was good to meet you last Thursday.  It is always fun to harass the NY
locals, even if it has to be done through a tele-conference camera.

Here is something to file away for future use, save the head-hunter fees and
give me a call direct the next time you are looking for a seasoned Nymex
futures/options hand.

Thanks,
Ted  Jones   281-293-2343

Hey bud the girls from Filo are requiring your presence. The blonde is not 
there any longer so it's not worth going anymore.

As promised I'm attaching my resume. I'm currently leading our EES Industrial 
strategy in Argentina so I haven't being selling any nat gas or power to 
customers lately (if we ever could........). It's challenging but there are 
other reasons that are making me explore new alternatives.

Let's talk once you have time to do so.

Take care and I appreciate your help.

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction
Process With FERC

FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative 
regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity
auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.

In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for 
selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. 
The filing
was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is 
consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which
encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' 
to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,
Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance 
filing made June 15.

``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party 
that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of
Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we 
conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often
wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current 
process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the 
auction is
closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''

According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving 
to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into
consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in 
capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term
contracts.

Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via 
its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm 
capacity.
Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the 
quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted
capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if 
Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with 
a
different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a 
present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time 
before a
binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.

Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles 
outlined in FERC's Order 637. 

    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will
          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be
          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).
    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-
          discriminatory basis.
    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing
          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be
          made available on the Internet.
    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since
          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to
          each capacity package made available.
    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's
          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection
          criteria were applied.
    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all
          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to
          all bidders through an Internet-based system.


``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity 
auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all 
parties
as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.

Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is 
based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for
transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to 
withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

Columbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, 
Va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to
markets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10

energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its
operating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, 
including exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution,

How are we planning to handle daily volume swings on the 30% priced at Gas

Facility 514800, Transco Zone 3

Eric & John

Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

1 year term
or
2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000

firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
Department

gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
term

Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.

George x3-6992

Linda, our first wellhead book day trade; gas daily for the weekend was 
$8.175.  I'd also ultimately like to fix the price for the remainder of the 
month, but I don't want to take a "long term position" without more input 
from management.

Will, consistent with the tickets we provided you earlier today, you entered 
the following deals with the volumes indicated in the column "11/28/00 
Tickets":


Tennessee    11/28/00    10/26/00

Cabot:  #505870    14,720     14,400

Swing
Cabot:  #505880    3,680     3,600
D2D:  #505902


But, the volumes cited in the tickets prepared today were not consistent with 
the volumes for which the East Desk originally provided price quotes based on 
the volumes we cited on 10/26/00.  I have spoken with Scott Neal and he is 
agreeable to allowing us to amend the Sitara deals to reflect the 10/26/00 
volumes rather than the 11/28/00 volumes.  Please, therefore, substitute the 
Quoted volumes for the Ticketed volumes on the 8 deals listed above.  Thanks 
much.

I have prepared and attach herewith revised tickets.

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Best regards 


Andy

I just got a new cell phone, and I'm entering everyone's numbers.  I realize
that I have two cell numbers for you:  713-503-3466 and 713-203-4029.  Is
one of these Carol's, or is it an old number?

today i did an intraday deal between hydroquebec and connecticut natural

i sold it to connecticut natural at their gate @ $6.03 via unutilized 
intraday capacity  sitara deal 618626

the capacity costs are $0.09.  orgination should be granted on 
$6.03-.09=$5.94 equivalent at dracut.

or $5.94-5.65=.29 on 4000 mmbtu = $1,160

also i haven't seen the orgination on the feb8 transaction per my previous

Effective today Amerex and Power Merchants will have id's for 
www.brokerclient.com which will allow them to see prices on EnronOnline.  
Both brokers are putting security in place and once established they will 
also be able to execute transactions for their customers. 

The brokers will have access to the following products:

1. Amerex: World-wide gas, power, crude products and bandwidth
2. Power Merchants: US Financial Gas 

Both agreements include confidentiality language which prohibits discussion 
of the agreement with others.

Any questions relative to these agreements should be directed to me at 713

Mr. Neal,

 I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you
about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy
risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I
would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of questions,
I would be happy to provide them.
 This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't
want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy
risk applications are being used "on the ground".  I would like to be able
to write about Enron, but it is not required.
 I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the 
Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September 
of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly 
speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in 
December of '70.  

By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  
February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high 
of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 
the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the 
Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and 
geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking 
openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom

And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its 
way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were 
wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

Subject: Re: CES Update  

The first invoice for $5.4 million went out a couple of weeks ago.  CES came 
back to us and said they were not going to pay.  They claimed that the total 
of all of the invoices to this date that they have already paid had covered 
that amount.  I have researched all of their invoices, and it looks like 
there was a demand invoice in the system for the month of June for 
approximately $6 million to much.  CES incorporated a credit for that invoice 
in with the charge for $5.4 million, netting out to approximately $600,000.  
I am meeting with CES on Thursday to see if we are in agreement.  The other 
invoice for $7.5 million was sent out last week, CES is in agreement and the 
payment should be here shortly.
   If you have any questions don't hesitate to call me.

from Devon at reduced price....

Victor,

I wanted to keep you in the loop of an issue on Gulf South.  I watch these 
wellheads very closely and still have managed to accumulate penalty gas on 
meter 2848 for May.  I spoke with Victor Haley to alert him as soon as I 
discovered this issue and he was looking into it.  The wellhead is flowing 
nearly twice as much as normal.  Victor H. was checking to see if another 
wellhead has been added at that point.  He still does not have any further 
information on that meter.  He is aware of it, does not seem to be too 
concerned, and has a copy of the spreadsheet attached.  You will see his 
original nom request as 2400 and I moved it up accordingly.  

Let me know if you want to discuss this any further.

Thanks!

This is awsome and at the same time rather chilling.  Mother nature is
spectacular
This awesome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was
working while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so he
should
at least be recognized as the photographer of this once in a lifetime
shot

Western Spot Power Prices Stable to Higher on Southwest Heat

     Phoenix, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western U.S. peak spot
power prices for delivery tomorrow increased on weather-related
demand in the Southwest.
     Traders also said that higher natural gas values were keeping
a floor beneath Southwest power prices. Natural gas for June
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as high as
$4.635 per British thermal, 24.1 cents higher from yesterday's
close.
At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power gained $8 to a Bloomberg index of $213 a megawatt-hour, amid
trades in the $205-$220 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 50 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power rose
$2.64, to a Bloomberg index of $223.13 as traders executed
transactions in the $212.50-$250.00 range.
According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Phoenix were expected to reach 101
degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 4 degrees to 105
degrees.
     At the California Oregon Border, peak power increased $44.34
from yesterday. Traders completed trades in the $240.00-$250.00
range.
     "Power prices are rising as energy traders are being bullish
in today's market,'' said one Northwest trader.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
rose $31.03 to a Bloomberg index of $236.43, with trades at
$235.00-$250.00.

PJM Spot Prices Rise on Cinergy Jump, Forwards on Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot values for
peak power delivered to the Western Hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection rose in sympathy with climbing
day-ahead prices at the Ohio-based Cinergy Hub, traders said.
     For-Wednesday power was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-
weighted index of $38.15 per megawatt hour, up $2.18 from
yesterday. Traders said the market opened with sales at $40.00,
then tapered off to lows of $36.50 in post daily options activity.
     "It's got to be a knee jerk reaction to what's going on in
the [Mid]-West because generation is actually supposed to improve
tomorrow, and loads are supposed to come in a touch lower," one
PJM-based trader said of the higher prices.
     According to the Interconnection's Forecasted Generation
Outage Report, the pool will see a 25 percent increase in its
available supply tomorrow, bringing the total amount of off-line
generation down to 6,687 megawatts.
     In the over-the-counter market, short-term forwards moved
higher on anticpated cooling loads, while longer-term contracts
jumped in tandem with rising natural gas futures. Balance-of-the-
month and July-August packages were discussed $4.00 higher at
$47.00-$48.50 and $95.75-$98.00, respectively.
     June Henry Hub natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange reached a ten-day high this morning, on forecasts for
above-normal temperatures in the Southwest U.S. As of 2 p.m. local
time, June futures peaked at $4.635 per million British thermal
units.
     While the contract rose as much as 24.1 cents, its intra-day
high remains 48.08 cents below the three-month historical average,
and 56.39 cents below the six-month average.
     In New England Power Pool, next day values rose $4.80 to an
index price of $52.25. Traders said planned line maintenance on
the tie line, which transmits hydroelectric generation from Hydro
Quebec, limited today's imports and would continue to do so
through Friday.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Climb on Southern, Midwestern Demand

     Cincinnati, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
peak next-day power prices climbed again today as high weather-
related demand from the South and Midwest continued, traders
said.
     East Central Area Reliability Council traders said surplus
power available as a result of mild local weather and returning
generation continued to flow into the higher-priced Tennessee
Valley Authority grid.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered
Wednesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission
system rose $8.97 to $40.14 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging
from $38.00 up to $42.00 before options expiration.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $9.89 higher on average at
$36.50-$46.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast from 88-90 degrees Fahrenheit through Friday.
     Short-term over-the-counter prices at the Cinergy hub also
rose, as demand from the Southeast was expected to continue
through the end of the week. Power for Thursday-Friday delivery
traded as high as $45.00, up from $39.50 yesterday.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, continued
demand from Cinergy and a resumption of exports to the west drove
day-ahead energy prices up at the Chicago-based Commonwealth
Edison hub again today, traders said.
     Power sold $10.04 higher on average at ComEd, trading at
$36.00-$44.00 and as high as $48.00 in the local utility market.
In the lower half of the region, spot power traded at $42.00-
$51.00, up $9.88 on demand from the south and west.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices were
the highest in the region today, with temperatures well above
normal and transmission problems causing a premium to be added to
imported power, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $4.50 higher on average in northern MAPP
at $48.00-$55.00 and $5.61 higher on average in the southern half
of the region at $50.00-$58.00.
     In its seven-day forecast, Belton, Missouri-based Weather
Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 6
degrees above normal in Minneapolis, with cooling demand levels
133 percent above normal.
     "Some people's load forecasts were low, and they needed to
adjust today, so when hourlies jumped the dailies followed," one
MAPP trader said. "Also, we're as high as we are because a lot of
units are still off and transmission's a mess, so the market's
just going to butt up against gas prices."

Southeast Power Prices Jump as Southern Markets Stay Hot

     Atlanta, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were higher today as recent warm weather
failed to moderate as predicted, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 87 degrees Fahrenheit, 1 degree
higher than today's projected high. Yesterday, forecasters said
they expected cooler weather in Atlanta to begin tomorrow.
     Traders said Southern Co. was still a net buyer of spot
power in the $47.00 a megawatt-hour range, despite increased
power production from its recently restarted Farley Unit 2
reactor. The unit emerged from a planned refuel May 8, and was
operating at 99 percent of capacity early today.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose $10.03 a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made yesterday for delivery today, to $47.38.
Trades ranged from $34.50-$60.00.
     In Maryland, Constellation Energy' Group Inc's 850-
megawatt Calvert Cliffs Unit 2 reactor was reported at 55
percent of capacity early today, following the completion of
refueling operations on March 15.
     "It's going to be fairly warm in our service territory
over the balance of the week," said one Tennessee Valley
Authority trader. "We heard a few key players were deciding to
sell into the hourly markets tomorrow, which could keep the
day-ahead prices up."
     On the TVA grid, day-ahead prices began trade as low as
$36.50 although most trades were much higher as buyers emerged
to cover unforeseen air-cooling demand. The Bloomberg into-TVA
peak index price rose an average of $9.89 to $44.33, amid
trades in the $36.50-$46.00 range.
     Traders said early today that demand was highest on the
TVA grid. Later in the day traders said that most power was
flowing through the TVA grid to get to markets on the Southern
Co. grid, where demand was expected to be higher.
     Power sold into the Southern grid at a Bloomberg average
of $47.00, up $10.00 from yesterday amid trades in the $46.00-
$47.00 range.
     In Texas, traders reported light trading despite
yesterday's completion of Texas Utility's 345 kilovolt south-
to-north flowing Limestone-Watermill transmission line. Traders
said line capacity would increase from about 900 megawatts
daily to more than 2,000 megawatts.
     The Bloomberg firm "UB" power price for unit or
transmission contingent supply, rose $2.25 to $47.50, mostly on
rising natural gas prices, traders said.
     By mid-afternoon, the June natural gas futures contract on
the New York Mercantile Exchange had risen as much as 25.6
cents per million British thermal units to $4.650 per million
Btu. Gulf Coast day-ahead gas prices rose about 18 cents to
$4.37-$4.43, Bloomberg spot market surveys found.
     Traders said recent hot weather in the West and South had
caused the run up in natural gas values, despite expectations
for higher-than-usual injections into underground storage.

U.K. Day-ahead Power Contract Prices Rise on Outage Concerns

     London, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices for
delivery tomorrow climbed on reports of a possible nuclear plant
outage, traders said.
     Day-ahead baseload power started trade at 20.00 pounds a
megawatt-hour before rising to 23.00 pounds a megawatt-hour, 4.25
pounds higher than prices for today.
     Rumors of an outage at a Magnox nuclear plant pulled prices
higher as participants bought the day-ahead contract in an effort
to secure supply, traders said.
     Week 21 rose amid active buying interest ahead of several
planned maintenance outages next week, traders said.
     The contract traded in a range of 18.25-18.80 pounds a
megawatt-hour, before last trading at 18.65 pounds a megawatt-
hour, 45 pence higher than yesterday's close.
     Moreover, forecasts for lower temperatures also pushed prices
higher amid expectations for higher heating requirements, traders
said.
     Across the U.K. temperatures were forecast to average around
8-15 degrees Celsius today, falling to 6-13 degrees tomorrow,
according to the Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.
     June baseload traded 30 pence higher at 18.53 pounds a
megawatt-hour. July baseload traded 25 pence higher at 18.40
pounds a megawatt-hour.

Short-Term Nordic Power Surges on Unexpectedly High Spot Price

     Lysaker, Norway, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Short-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, surged in afternoon trade after the publication of a
higher-than-expected system area average price for tomorrow,
traders said.
     With 475 megawatts traded, week-21 jumped 4.50 Norwegian
kroner to close at 193.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after falling as
much as 3.00 kroner to 186.00 kroner a megawatt-hour before the
spot price was announced. Week-23 registered the largest gain
today, closing at 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour, up 6.50 kroner.
     Wednesday's spot price averaged 198.38 kroner a megawatt-
hour, up 12.68 kroner from today's price, compared to estimates of
180.00-185.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. Below-average snow
accumulation and snowmelt this year are curbing hydro-production,
traders said.
     In western Denmark, the maximum hourly spot price for
Wednesday was set at 595.25 kroner a megawatt-hour, 345.60 kroner
higher than a maximum of 249.65 kroner a megawatt-hour for the
exchange area because snowmelt inflow into Danish rivers was
decreasing, dwarfing supply, an Oslo-based trader said.
     In Trondheim, Norway, hourly spot prices averaged 216.12
kroner a megawatt-hour, 17.74 kroner higher than the system area
average price following power transmission restrictions from
eastern Norway where snowmelt was reported to be more abundant, a
Bergen, Norway-based trader said.
     Producers in eastern Norway will let reservoirs overflow
without generating electricity because of accelerated melting
while larger western producers will have better control over
output with empty dams and little snow.
     Even though water tank flooding forces some generators to
sell power at lower prices instead of letting water overspill with
no economic gain, others are unable to contain spillage at the
peak of the snowmelt season.
     Colder weather next week was also expected to boost end-user
demand for space heating, pushing prices higher. Traders continued
to downplay expectations of wet weather following recent over-
estimation of rainfall.
     Longer-term contracts also rose. Winter-2 2001 closed at a

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

I have a seat for Frank and I am working on Gil and the rest of those guys.  
Ina is out until Thursday, but I will be giving her a call at home this 
morning to see what can be done.  I will coordinate the move as  soon as I 
have a space.  Meanwhile, I am checking with the guys periodically to meet 
their needs while they are on the 31st floor.  Call me if you have any 
further questions x35193.

Steve,

Would you believe it's cold-weather driven????  They're forecasting average
temps up here of 58 on Thr, 54 on Fri, and 55 on Sat.  Jeanette and I both
believe that the demand forecasts are way too high.  Hopefully our gas
control will knock these forecasts down a little.

Darin

Let's set up a meeting to discuss.  The Wellhead Group is responsible for 
everything up to the mainline/pool including scheduling, nominations, 
operational swing etc.  The East desk would have a deal with the Wellheasd 
Group for a firm daily quantity of gas at the mainline or pool.

George, Could you please answer a few preliminary operational questions 
before we proceed..
Has Scott Neal approved this for our desk (assuming risk and swings)?  Is our 
logistics group nominating, scheduling, confirming and balancing this 
wellhead?   Are we buying from you or are we buying from Cabot??? Who's 
responsible for deal entry and management in Sitara? Who's responsible for 
notifying us of changes?  Do we need to acquire transport for this or is it 
moved IT (Transco charges for pool receipts)
Operationally we need as much lead time to submit timely noms daily and at 
the first of every month.  We would like changes/swings to be communicated 
via e-mail, fax if necessary and followed by phone call to ascertain 
receipt.... 
Once we have some of these questions answered we can talk details....
Thanks

Shawna, as we discussed, please adjust the pricing provision of the two (2) 
Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation gas purchase agreements to provide for 
the following:  on a daily basis, we will pay index minus $0.005 for the 
first 80% of the gas produced that day and gas daily minus $0.005 for the 
remaining 20% of the gas produced that day.  I believe this pricing mechanism 
roughly approximates the Kerr McGee pricing provision you recently prepared 
for Brian Riley at meter 6884.

Attached are three (3) Contract Preparation Requests for two (2) Committed 
Reserves Agreements (Purchase Directly from Producer) along with a 
Confidentiality Agreement for Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation 
production in Terrebonne Parish, LA, currently flowing on Transco (Turtle 
Bayou) and Tennessee (Kent Bayou).  As we discussed yesterday, the Committed 
Reserves Contracts requested herein should be virtually identical to the 
contract recently executed by Panaco, Inc. for the Sturlease well.  The 
Confidentiality Agreement will cover both Fields.

Eric & John

Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

1 year term
or
2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000

firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
Department

gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
term

Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.

George x3-6992

Scott,

Have you ever heard of anyone upgrading medium Btu gas (like landfill gas for 
example) in some way to get it up to pipeline specs?  Do you know any Chem. 
E. type who might have some idea of what it would take to do this?

A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10.

1.   eNYMEX  NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to 
replace Access and to handle basis trading.
   The system is targeted to launch some time during Q4  2000.   The basis 
products that might be traded are    Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj  fxd/float), 
Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.

2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players 
with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the 
current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board 
in the    next few weeks.    

3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the 
weekly storage data.     

4.  Sabine Hub discounts  Sabine is considering offering some discount 
through the Hub for volume commitment. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.

PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR AVAILABILITY!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy 
Meeting" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate 
change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the 
potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 12 
p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can 
finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have 
any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to 
contact me of Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.

Scott,

As you are already aware, we have to provide volume (settled sales only) 
explanations to Investor Relations each month.  Given that it's a quarter end 
month, it is even more important that we receive good explanations which 
sufficiently support your trading business.  The format includes a year to 
year comparison, quarter to quarter comparison as well as a month to month 
comparison for any increases/decreases greater than 10%.  Your stats are as 
follows:

EAST GAS TRADING (Bbtu/Day - Settled Sales Only)

Year to Year
September 2000 7,258
September 1999 3,179
Increase  128%

Quarter to Quarter
3Q 2000  7,282
3Q 1999  2,910
Increase  150%

If you could send me an explanation explaining what's driving your increase 
by tomorrow morning, that would be great.

Thanks, Paula

Scott-
 Hey there, this is Chris Graeter.  I wanted to check with you to see about
getting in touch with the person in charge of internships.  I am sure he or
she is busy, but in the mean time I was not sure if you or the person who
would be contacting me had my email address.  It is cgraeter@tamu.edu.  I
know that sometimes it is easier to get in touch with someone by email so I
wanted to make sure you had this information.  Thank you again for all your
assistance.  I hope to talk to you soon.

Sincerely,
Chris Graeter

Rolo and I worked together in BA.  Rolo did a great job for us, focusing 
mostly on gas but he did do some work on power as well.  
He is very bright and has a great work ethic.  He has gained a fair amount of 
commercial experience (including "trading" natural gas) in Argentina. I would 
recommend him highly.

Scott, 

I understand that John Lavorato and others are going to Sao Paulo next week 
to review the Trading business. Are you planing to join them in that trip? If 
you do, come to BA and we play some golf at Pilar.

Did someone from Europe contact you to ask about me?

Subject: Mog Heu

As you know, Mog has been selected for the trading track program.  Her 
initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a follow-up 
rotation in the back room.  However, she would like to do her initial 
trading-track rotation in the middle-marketing group.  She would be 
supporting the New York office (in Houston) where she would be assisting Per 
Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commodity 
hedge funds.  I think this rotation would be very valuable in her 
trading-track rotation.  After her rotation in this group, she would then 
proceed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.  Since those of 
you noted above had already agreed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato 
asked me to secure your agreement for this change.  He is agreeable provided 
those of you noted are in agreement as well.  The middle-marketing group 
would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feel this rotation would be 
very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.  If I do not 
receive an objection by Thursday, 5:00 P.M. - I will assume we can proceed 
ahead.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Scott,

Find attached my resume as we had arranged yesterday.
I you believe that I should be there the sooner the better I'll reschedule my 
vacations so as to be there on the first of January, if you believe arriving 
there on January 9 or 10 is OK I'll do that.
Probably on the first week of January people wont be at the office from their 
holyday season.???



Thanks buddy I appreciate your help.

I think maybe clarifying "then go to the transaction search" with something

Any idea who could help us understand alternatives on "above ground storage" 
within North America?

Thanks,

Scott,

Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent 
me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted 
to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her 
a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in 
most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.  Thanks, I 
appreciate it.

Steve

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and 
Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to 
have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in 
Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your 
reference.

thanks,

Scott

Scott,
I overheard you talking about NY City studies earlier.  The two files 
attached were work in progress that I although not completed and a little 
rough I thought may be useful in their current form.  I am working with 
Sabina Rank to take over and complete all of my projects and daily 
fundamentals duties.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,

(If you're not planning on going camping this weekend, please disregard
this memo.)

The basketball Gods have issued a technical foul to the Indian Guides by
scheduling a late Friday night game for all the boys that had RSVP'd to go
camping Friday night, so, here's Plan-B:

The official start-up time is now Saturday afternoon.  Let's plan on a
caravan to the campsite from Butch Butcher's house.  Let's meet there
around 2:00 pm.  If you can't leave at that time (earlier or later),
information on the campsites are available at the park entrance under
"Wilchester Indian Guides/Butcher".  Depending on the outcome of the game
Friday night, an earlier caravan may be going Saturday morning.  Stay close
to your phones.

As mentioned in earlier memo,  we will provide food for Saturday night (
hamburgers and fixin's for the boys).  If  Dads want something other than a
burger, please feel free to bring a steak to throw on the grill.  We will
also provide food for Sunday breakfast.  Please feel free to bring whatever
snacks or drinks you want as well.  Remember to bring bikes, fishing stuff
(optional), sporting goods, bug spray, camping stuff (I'm bringing an extra
tent), cards, lottery tickets, ...  If you need help getting your bike to
the park, call Butch (professional mover).

Oh yeah, Directions (if you miss the caravan):

>From US-59, take Grand Parkway (TX-99)/Crabb River Rd exit and proceed
South on Crabb River Rd.  Continue over RR tracks on TX-762 for about 15
miles and take left into Brazos Bend State Park entrance.

>From Clear Lake area (who's coming from Clear Lake ?) take either FM-517 or
FM-528 to TX-35.  Proceed to FM 1462 west.  Take a right on TX-762 and the
Park entrance is about 1 mile on the right.

Yah-teh-hay!

I need ten minutes of your time to review the discussion database concept 
that was requested by Frank Vickers back in Febuary.  The purpose of the 
meeting is to discuss the merits of the project, make a decision on whether 
we move forward and if we do move forward whose budget this would impact..  
Find attached a description of the project with a cost estimate ($10,560).
I have scheduled EB3259 at 5:00PM 4/24/01, if you cannot make it please let 
me know.

To All:

This is in response to the article in Gas Daily last week that mentioned the 
need for a short term working capital loan from the City of Philadelphia to 
cover their cash crunch due to higher natural gas prices.  Veronica and I 
spoke today to Tom Smyth, Controller of Philadelphia Gas Works, to understand 
this situation and gain comfort in their current credit situation.  Tom 
confirmed that a rate hike has been proposed to cover the increase gas costs 
associated with current market conditions.  Their last rate hike was in 1992, 
at a time when natural gas prices were in a more stable environment.  He 
reiterated that this rate hike will alleviate the cash crunch that the entity 
has experienced and will provide enough cash flow to operate in this 
environment.   Further confidence in the stability of Phil Gas Works is 
derived from the fact that the entity is a political sub-division of the City 
of Philadelphia and is the only gas supplier to residents and businesses in 
the city.  Currently ENA is selling between 10,000-15,000 mmbtu/d to the 
counterparty incurring a 30-day receivable risk of $1.5 to $2.3MM, which is 
under their current credit limit.

Regards,
Russell

sorry for the delay, I just checked my email

1.  yes
2. Lorraine Ryall met came to Houston during March 2000 for Gas Fair and she 
stopped by our office for a brief visit.
3.  I am not aware of any.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Subject: ENA v. Triad

 
 Scott and Tori: 

 I hope you are both doing well.  I have some questions for you about this 
matter that will help me on a jurisdictional legal issue:  

 1.  Can we say that for each of the spot gas sales that you made to Triad, 
Triad would have called you (or someone else with ENA) first, and that you 
would have taken the call in Houston?  I am assuming that this is probably 
the case, but I would like to get confirmation from each of you. 

 2.  Did Sherwood Purnell or anyone else from Triad ever come to Houston to 
meet with either of you (or anyone else with ENA of whom you are aware)?

 3.  Are there any other contacts between Triad and Texas that either of you 
are aware of?

 Many thanks for your usual quick response.

 Britt

 P.S. to Becky--I think you had some questions for Credit about how much is 
owed.  Can you please flange that down today or tomorrow?  I want to get the 
petition filed this week.

Live video from our morning call: [IMAGE]


After the last two horrible quarters, many of  us are probably telling 
ourselves that it can't get much worse than it's been.  For those of us who 
believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little 
history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.

For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  
pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has 
had  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's 
fairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent 
commentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.

Over the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has 
been, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 
1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.

There were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. 
There were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single 
six-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an 
astonishing 52.92%.

Of the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 
1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very 
worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the 
wake of the stock market crash of 1929.  

The worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the 
one ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 
1970s. 

The most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the 
one ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the 
1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month 
period. 

This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  
means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time 
it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 
has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 
years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. 

It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went 
down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an 
additional 18.24%. 

Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 
chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course 
the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things 
getting  better. 

But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six 
months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the 
coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the 
last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  
If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  
left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. 

History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  
day).

Guys,
A friend recommended Capacity Center, a service that e-mails information on 
capacity release, daily activity reports and system notices from pipelines on 
a daily basis.  There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, 
time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the 
number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months 
the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I 
have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here 
http://www.capacitycenter.com/  the login name is sboyle@enron.com and 
password is jackd.  Let me know if you would like an overview or see any 
reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.  Or you can call

Subject: Re: New Notice from Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation  

This one is an exception. I sent out a mail about this site before, about a 
month ago, 
let me explain the situation again.
It is weird that this web site uses such a long line as the URL link for 
their critical notices, 
but Lotus notes can only take the first line starting with http:// as the hot 
link, this is why you see
only the first line was underlined as the link. When you click the partial 
URL link, of course you'll
get an error. To work around this you need to copy the whole five lines, open 
your IE and paste
it to the address box and press "Enter". Let me know if there is still a 
question. Thanks.

I really don't have a clue.  However,it seems that most of the costs are 
generally fixed - people, systems, etc.

Scott,

I'm working with some guys that are trying to build out some software to
improve back office efficiencies...do you have any good reference points for
back office costs in power trading on a $/Mwhr basis?

I figure it is  bit busy at the moment and will call you this afternoon to
follow up...

Subject: Spread option on Tiverton for Bal '00

Calpine-EMI wants to get a bid from us on a spread option on their Tiverton 
plant in Tiverton, Rhode Island for Sept 1, 00 through Dec 31, 00.  (Tiverton 
apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)  I will be 
pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no 
later than end of this week.  They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities 
including us.  Here are some details FYI:

Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas
Power qty = 250 MW
Power strike = $45/Mwh
Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an 
implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh
Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu
Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity 
rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral
Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than 
95%
Gas firmness:  secondary firm

Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any 
feedback on the degree of "strategic fit" this position would provide us.  
Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece 
and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous 
customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit 
off).  Thanks all

John

Please note that as of Wednesday, December 13, Gas Daily will begin 
publishing an Electronic Trading Index for the gas market. We will be 
contributing to this index, which will show prices similar to those currently 
available in the EnronOnline Content section under "EnronOnline Price 
Reports".

If you or others in your organization get questions from customers or media, 
please refer to the following points regarding the message we're trying to 
promote:
An increasing number of transactions done online are proving the 
"staying-power" of the platforms and are legitimizing transaction data from 
them.
Ideally, these numbers should be audited before being given to the 
publications so as to minimize reporting errors.  EnronOnline's numbers are 
audited by Arthur Andersen on a periodic basis.
An increased participation from the other platforms will allow these indices 
gain more credibility/appeal and encourage customers to settle on them.

Please forward this email to appropriate people in your dept.

If you have any questions on the above, please contact Rahil Jafry on 33206.

Thanks,

Dave

We will get working on this.

I have no problem with you sitting in on the PRC process.  We are scheduled 
to have this meeting on Nov. 29, however I think there is some chance this 
date might change due to bid week activities.

Scott, great to see you last week even if it was only for a short period.  I 
hear that the Org announcement is scheduled for Tuesday November 14th at 
3:00.  Have you heard the same ?  I will be back in Houston early next week 
for the announcement.  I suggest that you and I plan to meet with the group 
either immediately after the announcement or perhaps after trading the 
following day.  I tend to think that the next day may be better.

In addition, as we discussed I would like to get one of the 
analysts/associates working on pulling the following information together.

List of our states.  maybe there is some overlap with the mid-west but as you 
know this new organization will have everyone focused and we do not want any 
confusion.
Master list of ALL gas users within those states.  If there are any LDC's 
etc. that cross state boundaries or cross regional boundaries we will need to 
know that and make sure Enron coverage is appropriately assigned.  Delainey 
continues to say that he wants to make sure that everyone is covered and 
nothing falls through the cracks.
>From the master list we can determine our current level of business and 
relationship with that particular market, high, medium, low.
>From Master list we can determine 2001 assignments.


This is fundamental but important in my opinion.



Another issue that I was thinking about is that it would be helpful for me to 
sit in on this years PRC for all members of our staff.  I will not add 
anything but it will give me a sense of how they are doing and what to expect 
as we move forward.  Do you approve of that ?  When is that scheduled ?

I did not get the metrics from Janet yet but am scheduled to do that when I 
am in next week.  I will get you a copy at that time.



Thanks

Frank

Subject: September Wholesale Volumes


It's that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!  
The database for September is now ready for viewing.  Just as a reminder, 
this is the shortcut on your desktop called "Statistical Database". 

As there is continued investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor 
Relations requests that Business Analysis & Reporting provide monthly 
volumetric analysis for Wholesale Operations in addition to the quarterly 
analysis.  Please review the analysis for September 2000 and provide 
explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, 
quarter/quarter, and month/month variances.  The current objective of 
Investor Relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential 
investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and 
presentations.   It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial 
personnel.

Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail to me by 3:00pm 
Tuesday, October 10th.  Please feel free to call with any questions.

Thanks,

Misti

Network Appliance Selects TIBCO Software to Support Enterprise
System Initiatives

TIBCO Technology Enables Network Appliance to Integrate Its Internal 
Enterprise Systems Without Disrupting Its
Business

PALO ALTO, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Advancing its leadership in the 
application integration space, TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX -
news), a leading provider of real-time infrastructure software for 
e-business, announced today Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTAP - news), the
leading provider of network-attached data access and content management 
solutions, has selected the TIBCO ActiveEnterprisec e-business product
suite to integrate its internal enterprise systems and applications. As a 
fast growing company, Network Appliance has been continually implementing
best-in-class enterprise systems such as enterprise resource planning, 
customer resource management, human resources and manufacturing applications.
To integrate these disparate systems and ensure that the right people within 
Network Appliance have access to the information they need, Network
Appliance turned to TIBCO.

``We need an integration tool that will not only enable us to share 
information internally, but will also enable us to extend access to this 
information beyond
our corporate firewalls, as we expand our e-commerce capabilities,'' said Ric 
McCormick, director of business applications for Network Appliance.
``TIBCO's proven e-business solutions provide us with the scalability, 
security and reliability we need to ensure that our technology infrastructure 
can
keep up with our business growth, and just as important, that our vital 
business processes not be disrupted as we continue to implement new 
solutions.''

``To be successful e-businesses, companies need a highly efficient 
information infrastructure that connects every system and process in the 
enterprise,''
said Fred Meyer, vice president of product management for TIBCO Software. 
``TIBCO ActiveEnterprise is helping leading companies like Network
Appliance further leverage their front-end and back-end IT systems and bring 
those systems closer to customers and partners over the Web.''

About TIBCO ActiveEnterprise

The core of TIBCO's real-time software infrastructure offering is the TIBCO 
ActiveEnterprise suite, designed for building a complete, end-to-end
Internet and enterprise infrastructure that successfully scales to the most 
demanding business information networks. It provides a real-time e-business
integration platform that encompasses data integration and transformation, 
business process coordination, messaging, enterprise portals and alerting,
adapters for legacy, packaged and third-party applications, plus enterprise 
monitoring and management.

About Network Appliance

Network Appliance, Inc., a veteran in network file serving and caching, has 
been providing data access solutions since 1992, and is a member of both the
S+P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index. Major corporations and ISPs, including Lycos, 
Yahoo!, Citicorp Securities, Siemens, Lockheed, Cisco, Motorola, and

solutions (NetCache(TM) appliances) and file servers (filers) deliver fast,
simple, reliable, and cost-effective access to network-stored data and enable

Wide Web.

The company pioneered the concept of the ``network appliance,'' an extension 
of the industry trend toward dedicated, specialized products that perform
a single function. Network Appliance filers and NetCache appliances are based 
on the company's innovative data access software known as the Data
ONTAP(TM) operating system and standards-compliant hardware.

Scott, hope all is well.  Sorry that I have been so out of touch lately.  
Trying to get deals closed sell a house buy a house so on and so on.  I am 
going to be in the Houston office on Wed and Thur (Nov 8 & 9).  Can we get 
together ?  What is good for you ?  When are they planning to announce all of 
this ?  I want to initiate ideas and discussions with other team members but 
do not want to jump the gun.  Maybe everyone already knows.  Being in 
Portland it is hard to tell.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract 
later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we 
haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already 
at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  
If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and 
associates arrive and do a session then.

landscaping, filming towers and a new concession stand with a bulletin

hamburgers, hotdogs, chips and cotton candy, as well as usual concessions.
Commemorative Millennium Season 2000 T-shirts will be on sale for $12.00.
These shirts will include both flag and tackle team names on the back.
Don=01,t be left out, get your T-shirt early.

Season Programs will be on sale for $3.00.  The program includes each team
=01,s roster listing the players=01, name, jersey number and school.  The
program will also have each team=01,s season schedule.  These programs will
be useful for the entire season.  To help defer the $3.00 price,
Fuddrucker's has included a 10% discount card with each program good
throughout the football season.  We also thank Diamond Kuts and Sports
Clips for their advertisements.

Players, now is your chance to get back at your coaches.  There will be
Dunking Booths with each Team=01,s coaches taking their turn to be your
target.  Come by for a chance to throw the football and send them under.
Your coaches will be in the Dunking Booths following your game.  Please
plan to stick around for an additional hour following your game.  This
will allow you to enjoy all of these activities as well as watching your
opponents play.

All proceeds from the days activities will be used exclusively for the

Looking forward to the new season!

I also think Chris was very positive about me joining his team.

Thanks again and I truly hope I can make up there. Florencia is also excited 
about us living a family experience in the US.

Thanks buddy.

You need to take that draft to bank by tomorrow.  Mom got a voice mail saying

Subject: NIMO  

Sean,

I talked to Bruce a couple of days ago but got a little different spin.  The 
short list is 6 companies, not 5.  Out of 12 companies, 8 responded and we 
were second the last.  NIMO was disappointed that more companies did not bid 
on their RFP.  I asked if an extra $2MM would have pushed us into the short 
list.  NIMO said yes but it would still not be the highest bid.  Our bid was 
$4.9 MM.  I think we may have undervalued the CNG transport, storage 
optionality and the TGP Zone 5 deliveries into NIMO (new interconnect).

I have forwarded the peaking proposal to Mark Breese last week and he is 
working on it.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Feedback from NiMo

I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP.  Bruce indicated NiMo 
short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA.  However, he also 
mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the fifth highest bid. He 
gave no indication on the value of the highest bid.  He also said that the 
other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative 
structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure.   
NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter, I 
believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP.  
Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP.
Thanks,
Sean

a great lead-in to future sessions.  Like we agreed, I would like to have 
these round table discussions once a month.  I'll check with Kimberly to see 
what your schedule looks like in the future and schedule them.

As you are already aware, Suzanne Nichole has moved on and I am the new team 
reporting accountant for Gas Trading.  I am in the process of working on your 
plans for 2001.  Dealiney and Lavarato communicated that 2001 margin plans 
are to be initiated by each team and the minimum increase expected is 20% 
over each of your 2000 plans.  Please send me your margin expectations so 
that I can update the templates and forward you revised copies which will 
include your direct expense plan dollars.

Given that the deadline for turning this information in to the Office of the 
Chair is approaching soon, please send me your estimates as soon as you can.

Thanks, Paula.

Todd,

I am available for fishing with you on Sept.8. On the 8 Sept. when you
arrive, I will take you to fish and we can discuss what type of deep fishing
you want. It is no problem getting a guide if I can not take you deep
fishing. This is a slow season and a lot of tour guides are available. You
do not need to bring any equipment. We have any kind you need. Are you
staying at Holiday Hotel ? I will speak to you on the day of your arrival.
Hope to see you soon.

Abel Guerrero Esq.

Nelson,

I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the 
Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they 
will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.  

sitara #778201

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central 
gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.


Thanks,

Kam

Subject: Schedule - Week of 11/12/00


Dear Wildcats:

What a great game you guys had against the Titans!  The team party at
Speedy's was great - a special thanks to Mrs. Burge and Mrs. Gwydir for
organizing the event.

For this week, I spoke to the Commissioner this morning and he stated our
Tully Bowl Game is "95%  sure for Sunday, November 19, 2:00pm".  If this
is so,
I would like everyone to report at 1:00pm.

Here is the balance of the schedule for the week:

Wednesday, Nov. 15 - Practice 4:30-6:00pm
Thursday, Nov. 16 - Backfield only - no pads - 5:15-6:00
Saturday, Nov. 18 - Practice 9:00-11:00am

Special note: Do not wear your football cleats to the Tully Bowl - They
don't
work on the Astro Turf - WEAR TENNIS SHOES ON SUNDAY!

Lets work hard this week  and Beat The Mustangs!
Go Wildcats!

Rockhounds & Parents,
?
Looks like we'll be rained out this afternoon for batting cage  practice.? 
For tomorrow's practice we'll probably be unable to play on the  field due to 
standing water, or possibly continued rain, but, we will go ahead  and have a 
"skull" session at my house at 9:00am.? My address is 13611  Pinerock, just 
off of Yorkchester (between Wilchester and Kirkwood), 4 blocks  north of 
Memorial.
?
The practice tomorrow will be 1 hour, from 9 till 10:00.?  See everyone then.
?
Jeff

Subject: Floating LNG Terminal

Folks,

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm

Please let me know if any further research is needed.


Charlie Weldon

Subject: Sabotage Acts

Argentine Power Market update:
A series of sabotage acts occurred last Tuesday, putting the whole Argentine 
Electric System in danger of collapsing. The problems started at 8:30 PM when 
one of the 500 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2 
other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3 
incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high 
tension towers were sawed.
In addition to the transmission lines sabotage, at 10:00 PM, one of the 
Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW.
This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an 
overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as 
well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked 
out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW.

As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 11:00 
PM.
Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday.

For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the 
sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish).

Julian

let's talk this afternoon.  I think we need to think about a couple of these 
folks.  Also, Dave needs our 2000 goals and objectives, top target customers, 
as well ideas for coverage metrics.  I have a meeting from 3pm to 4pm but am 
available any other time.

Scott, hope all is well.  I will get to the point.  What are your suggestions 
on the individuals that we have been assigned ?  I need to rely on you for 
any input that might suggest that we not take someone on.  I understand that 
Dave wants any personel changes as soon as possible.  What do you think ?  We 
do not want to begin with HR problems if we can avoid it upfront.

Please e-mail or call at 503-464-3940.

Subject: Bunge Energy Analysis

Dick, 
As we discussed today, Enron's analysis of Bunge's energy information 
indicates
inadequate regulatory and pricing opportunity for Enron to create additional 
value for Bunge.

Electricity:
The predominance of electricity usage occurs in states that are either 
several years
away from enacting deregulation or where the rules are insufficiently 
determined at this
time to even estimate an opening date.  When opening dates are more clearly 
defined
and we have confidence in energy curves for those markets, then we could 
revisit this
area of your energy profile. 

Natural Gas:
Bunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term supply and 
transporation 
agreements which have effectively managed your price/therm.  For those 
reasons, the 
opportunities are very limited for Enron to apply a consolidation approach 
and provide
compelling additional value for Bunge.

As we agreed in January, the first objective was to define the potential for 
mutual value
and then decide what, if any next steps were appropriate.  I regret we will 
not be able to
help Bunge at this time, but know that Enron will remain interested in 
assisting your
company in the future if and when market conditions afford us that 
opportunity.  

Please feel free to contact me at any time in the future if I can help answer 
further questions
for you or others who have been involved in this process.  Dick, thank you 
again for 
providing your time and attention to this inquiry process.  

Sincerely,

Gary Mirich

?
As discussed, here's the particulars on the Bee County  Ranch:
?
795+ ac, lots of oak trees, one of the higher hills in Bee  County.? Good mix 
of pasture and sage brush.? There's a water well and  tank.? 
?
A real "honey hole".? Lots of quail and prime dove  hunting. Deer,?hogs and 
supposedly some turkey.
?
Owner's name is Colton Brinkoeter.? Asking $675/acre, no  minerals.? 
Negotiable.? I think for that price you ought to get 1/4 -  1/2 of the 
minerals.
?
Ranch is three miles west of Mineral (NNW of Beeville about 15  miles).? His 
number is 361-358-2582.? I found out about it from a  mutual friend of ours, 
Bryan Key, also from Beeville.
?
P.S.? I've also attached my resume.? It looks like  our pipe deal fell 
through, and I am looking hard for a job back in  international marketing.? 
Let me know if you hear of anything.

yes, I have seen the fertilizer companies back off their buying due to gas 
prices.    Terra Resources reduced their purchasing signficantly for the 
month of June, supposedly they bought no spot gas at all only term 
commitments.   There total load is around 200,000 but I do not know the mix 
up between spot and term.   Also CF Industries and Farmland (which are small 
gas buyers) reduced their volumes as well.    PCS initially reduced their 
voumes for thier Geismer facility but when gas prices dipped to upper 3.90s 
and low 4.00's they came in and bought the supples they had curtailed and are 
at max volumes.

Scott,
  Please let your gas traders know that Inside FERC will not accept bidweek
prices via fax any later than 2 p.m. Eastern time. It takes a great deal of 
time
to input each deal by hand and then re-check the data for accuracy -- and 
that's
before we even begin to analyze each pricing point to determine the indexes.
  If anyone has any questions, they can contact me at the number below.

Scott asked for some assistance on the booking of the LGS deal and the impact 
it would have if we unwound certain hedges. To help me better understand the 
impact this would have, I need to understand the way we originally booked the 
deal.   David, you and I have talked about this some, but I still don't have 
all the info I need.  (Let me know if Scott, Craig and Farzad have already 
figured all this out and I'll drop it, but to my knowledge they still need 
help figuring this all out).  Hopefully my thoughts outlined below will help 
you understand what I'm looking for and why.

As I understand the LGS deal, ENA pays an annual $1.35 MM to utilize the 
assets, including storage; ENA gets to keep value generated (including 
summer/winter spread) up to $1.5MM, then it is shared 50/50; however, LGS has 
to know about and agree with any hedges we put on to lock in a particular 
spread.  When Structuring booked this deal in January, summer/winter spreads 
were locked in for the entire period we have the deal (through 2003); 
however, it is my understanding that LGS has only been made aware of the 
front year hedges (which I understand have been changed around a bit since 
the beginning and that's o.k.).    

What I need to know is--how was this deal booked?  When the $1.35 MM payment 
goes to LGS, is that covered through the hedges that were put on?  How 
exactly do the dollars flow between books?

I think this will help us figure out what would fall out If Scott removes 
certain forward hedges and what risk he would take on.  It seems to me that 
he would be at risk for whatever spread we had locked in originally, but I'm 
not sure exactly how this would show up.  Basically, it seems as if Scott is 
at risk with the hedges on, that if the actual spread is wider by the time 
LGS is informed of the injection/withdrawal schedule (or LGS begins pushing 
us to put on hedges), he would lose; likewise, it seems that if he takes the 
hedges off and the actual spread comes in tighter, he would lose.  
Conversely, if he takes the hedges off and the actual spread comes in wider, 
I think he would win.  Anyway, I want to get together on Monday and go over 
this with the three of you and figure this all out.  Please let me know if 
10:00 Monday morning (7/31) works for you, then I'll ask Kim to get a 
conference room.

Scott,

Attached below is the transport model I have been using for new deals.  It is 
set up right now for the Cranberry deal, but Kyle can show you how to modify 
it for any new deal.  Obviously, I have not been relying heavily on the 
extrinsic values this model produces.

US Govt. data - 


 Business inventories rose 0.9% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations
of a 0.6% rise and matching the revised May figure. Retailers saw the
biggest increase; their inventories rose 1.2% in June. Total business sales
were also up 0.9% in June, a slightly weaker showing than the revised 1.1%
rise posted in May. The inventory-to-sales ratio--the number of months it
would take to empty the nation's warehouses, store shelves, and sales lots
at the current rate of sales--remained at 1.32, just off its all-time low.
In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July,
double the pace in June. Industrial production, which measures output at
U.S. factories, utilities, and mines, is now 5.8% stronger than it was this
time last year, due mainly to continued growth in high-tech manufacturing.

I would like to request a "view only" Enron OnLine I.D.  I do not need to 
make trades with it but the pricing is important to the DPL and MVR daily

All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking 
the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is 
the person I 
contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be 
in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her 
phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the 
email, I look forward to seeing you this summer.

Scott

Scott:

Greetings from LSU.  I sent you an email a few weeks ago, but perhaps you
didn't receive it.  No big deal.

I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.  My last
semester is shaping up to be pretty tough.  The MBA class in Real Options
is, to say the least, tough!  I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, and
so far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model,
risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo,
and pricing American, European, and exotic options.  What's also great
about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example
of how this stuff works in the real world.  It's a great class!

One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well,
because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time.
Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I need
to be doing.

I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlighting
lines on every page!  I figured I'd start with the less technical books
first, considering my workload.

I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/11
with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July.  Let me know
how your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together.

Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading
rotation that you spoke of is still a high probability.  As I'm learning
more about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think
trading is where I want to be!

Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.  I hope all is well in
Houston.

Kevin

Subject: 10-year gas sale from Elba Island


Hey Phil, let's set up a meeting for later this week to walk thru this deal 
structure in detail with Scott Neal. If we think there is real value here to 
ENA, I'd like to take this to execution asap. However, if we don't think we 
can/want to make these commitments, let's cut the cord and move on. The 
critical path item as I see it is what we want to do at Elba Island as far as 
offtake obligation. There is certainly substantial value here compared to the 
current gas index price embedded in the Elba tolling agreement. 

Jeff, depending on your schedule, you may want to try and attend.  Thanks.

Scott, 
I currently have view only access for EOL.  Can you set me up with a 
transaction id?  I will run Columbia Gulf Mainline, unless you have other

Northwest Spot Electricity Prices Rise With Reduced Snowmelt

     Portland, Oregon, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak spot
power prices for Friday-Saturday delivery in the Pacific
Northwest increased as less snowmelt and river runoff was
available for hydroelectric generation, traders said.
     A Bloomberg report shows accumulated precipitation in the
Western U.S. at 30.33 percent below typical levels and the snow
water equivalent for the region at 64.25 percent below average.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, the
Bloomberg index increased $24.82 from yesterday to $153.60 a
megawatt hour, with trades executed between $145.00-$160.00.
     "The rain has stopped in the Northwest, and unlike the
snowmelt and the river run-off we had yesterday, it's beginning
to slow down,'' said one Northwest trader.
     At the California Oregon Border, day-ahead peak power gained
$22.60 to a Bloomberg index of $162.60, selling in a range of
$160.00-$166.00.
     According to Weather Services Corp. of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Astoria, Oregon, were expected to
reach 57 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 59 degrees.
     "Northwest power prices are also rising with (the) Colstrip
unit down,'' said one Northwest marketer.
     Pennsylvania Power and Light Co.'s 700-megawatt Colstrip-3
coal-fired plant located in Colstrip, Montana, shut yesterday for
unplanned maintenance and is expected to restart tomorrow.
      At the NP-15 delivery point, peak power traded at $160.00-
$165.00, rising $9.79.
     Traders said power prices will likely increase over the next
few days as snowmelt continues to lessen and higher temperatures
are expected.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., temperatures are expected to average 4.4 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal in the Pacific Northwest and 2.7 degrees above
normal in the Southwest 6-10 days from now.

Most Northeast Spot Power Prices Remain Steady With Low Demand

     Philadelphia, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Values for next-
day delivery of peak power remained little changed throughout most
of the Northeast U.S. as moderate temperatures continue to curb
regional load requirements, traders said.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Friday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $39.40 per megawatt hour, up only 60
cents from yesterday.
     "This is the annual calm before the storm," said one PJM-
based trader. "Prices are right where they should be for this time
of year, barring any unforeseen unit outages or sustained heat
waves, of course."
     Power scheduled for Friday delivery during this week last
year was valued at $36.50, representing an 8.2 percent departure
from today's comparative index.
     In the over-the-counter market, expectations for increased
supply and scant cooling demand further eroded next-week prices.
The five-day package was discussed at $38.29-39.25, compared to
$42.50-$43 yesterday.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average 1.1 degree Fahrenheit
below normal May 21-May 25.
     Day-ahead values in the New England Power Pool were also
little changed at an index price of $51.50. Traders cited heavy
volume in the $51.50-$52.00 range, with an intra-day low and high
of $49.75 and $53.00, respectively.
     Next-week packages remained steady as well, as scheduled line
maintenance offset price reactions to the anticipated restart of
Entergy Corp.'s Pilgrim 1 nuclear unit.
     Data from the Independent System Operator of New England
shows the Alps-New Scotland transmission line that transmits power
to and from New York will be shut May 21-May 24 for breaker
repairs.
     New York was the Northeast's anomaly, with next-day values
trading higher across all three zones because of unit outages.
Zone A jumped $4.25 to an index of $43.00, while Zones G and J
posted increases of $3.25 and $2.13, respectively, to $54.00 and
$58.13 indices.
     Niagara Mohawk's 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear
unit shut automatically yesterday due to a turbine trip. The
company is investigating the cause and hasn't released an expected
restart date.
     Mirant Corp. also lost a unit unexpectedly, its 447-megawatt
Tomkins Cove plant, following a boiler explosion. The plant is
located 25 miles north of New York City and is fueled by coal,
natural gas and oil. Company officials told Bloomberg the unit
will remain in shutdown until the cause of the explosion has been
determined.

ECAR Power Prices Fall as Squeeze Ends; MAIN, MAPP Also Drop

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day power prices declined as traders finished covering short
sales in the East Central Area Reliability Council and cooler
weather moved into the Midwest, traders said.
     ECAR traders said prices fell across the region as the
Cinergy hub market returned to levels seen before yesterday's
"short squeeze," where many market participants had to buy power
to fulfill requirements from prior sales.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Friday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system fell $6.29
to $39.96 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $42.00 down
to $38.00 after options expiration.
     "There was still plenty of volume, and plenty of demand from
the South," one ECAR trader said. "The drop was just a return to
more fundamentally-based prices after yesterday's short squeeze
went as far as it could go."
     Over-the-counter prices at Cinergy continued to decline
after a bearish injection report from the American Gas
Association drove natural gas futures prices down further and
weather forecasts were revised cooler for next week.
     Peak Cinergy parcels for delivery from May 21-25 sold at
$35.00, down $5.00 from yesterday, while offers fell to $62.00
for June power and $95.00 for July-August parcels, the lowest
level seen this year.
     In the Mid-America Interconnected Network, day-ahead power
prices dropped as temperatures were expected to do the same, with
peak parcels selling $5.79 less on average at $36.00-$40.00 at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub and $5.21 less on
average at $41.00-$47.00 in the lower half of the region.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted high temperatures in Chicago would fall from 84 degrees
Fahrenheit today to 75 degrees tomorrow.
     Mid-Continent Power Pool next-day electricity prices also
fell, as cooler weather reduced demand and lessened transmission
constraints, traders said.
     Peak power sold $7.00 less at $43.00-$46.00 in northern MAPP
and $6.94 less at $44.00-$48.00 in the southern half of the
region.
     Weather Services forecast tomorrow's high temperature in the
low-to-mid 70s degrees across MAPP, down from temperatures in
mid-80s to low-90s degrees earlier this week.

Most Southeast Power Prices Drop as Cooler Weather Dominates

     Topeka, Kansas, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S.
Southeast spot electricity prices were mostly lower today as
cooler weather was projected to move through the region
tomorrow, traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price fell an average of $2.30 a megawatt-hour,
or 4.8 percent from equivalent trades made yesterday for
delivery today, to $45.47, amid trades in the $36.00-$65.00
range.
     "We're going to have a 15 degree (Fahrenheit) temperatures
change from today to tomorrow if the forecasts are right," said
one Southwest Power Pool utility trader. "Because quite a few
units are coming back from maintenance, next week's really
going to soften up."
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Topeka
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 71 degrees Fahrenheit, off from
today's projected high of 84 degrees.
     In the Tennessee Valley, traders said expected high
temperatures will decline about 1-3 degrees through tomorrow,
cutting residential and commercial power demand for air
cooling.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, the Bloomberg peak
next-day index price slid $3.07 to $41.50 amid trades in the
$36.00-$44.00 range. Off-peak energy was discussed at $16-$18,
$2 higher on cooler expected overnight weather.
     Utility traders in the Virginia-Carolinas region said that
recent warm weather would continue through tomorrow and the
weekend, though temperatures would start out cooler through the
first half of next week.
     The Bloomberg VACAR index fell an average of $2.58 to
$45.55 amid trades at $45.00-$48.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about a half degree above normal over the next week,
though temperatures could average 4.1 degrees below normal over
the next 6-10 days.

U.K. Power Prices Little Changed in Lackluster Trade

     London, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
were little changed today amid lethargic activity, traders said.
     June traded 10 pence higher at 18.45 pounds a megawatt-hour.
July traded 10 pence lower at 18.30 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Activity was "directionless" today amid little new
information to trade on, traders said.
     Although many power plants have scheduled outages over the
coming months for maintenance, one trader said price gains were
offset by sufficient supply in the market.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded 15 pence higher than yesterday
following trades at 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 18.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, 65 pence lower than yesterday.
     Day-ahead peak traded at 22.00 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40
pence lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

Cove Point LNG Completes Open Season With 3 Pacts

06/09/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of
Columbia Energy Group (CG) Friday completed its open season for firm liquid
natural gas (LNG) tanker discharging service at its Cove Point terminal near
Lusby, Md., the company said.

  Cove Point LNG executed binding agreements with Coral LNG Inc., El Paso
Merchant Energy-Gas, LP (EPG) and a subsidiary of BP Amoco Corp. (BPA).
  The three customers will begin service agreements upon receipt of regulatory
approvals.

  The open season process for the proposed service began Feb. 16, with the new
service providing 4.25 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and 750 million
cubic feet per day of terminal and pipeline capacity to accommodate LNG
imports by the three companies.

  The open season agreements also provide for a 2.5 Bcf (vapor equivalent)
storage capacity expansion of Cove Point's Lusby, Md. location.

  Cove Point anticipates filing an application with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to provide the LNG tanker discharging service, to
recommission Cove Point marine facilities and to construct new storage
facilities including the new LNG storage.

  Columbia Energy Group agreed to sell partnership interests in Cove Point LNG
Limited Partnership to Williams Cos. (WMB) subsidiaries for $150 million. The
transaction should be complete in July, the companies said Friday.

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=
st=20
week.
>From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=
on=20
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=
=20
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=

Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=

expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=

market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=

=20
More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=
=20
the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=
e=20
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=
=20
injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=
=20
futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=
=20
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=
n=20
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=
=20
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=
er.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20
heating load
from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=
h CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=
=20
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=
=20
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=
e=20
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=
=20
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
=20
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=
ng=20
AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

As you are already aware, Suzanne Nichole has moved on and I am the new team 
reporting accountant for Gas Trading.  I am in the process of working on your 
plans for 2001.  Dealiney and Lavarato communicated that 2001 margin plans 
are to be initiated by each team and the minimum increase expected is 20% 
over each of your 2000 plans.  Please send me your margin expectations so 
that I can update the templates and forward you revised copies which will 
include your direct expense plan dollars.

Given that the deadline for turning this information in to the Office of the 
Chair is approaching soon, please send me your estimates as soon as you can.

Thanks, Paula.

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and 
Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to 
have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

George x3-6992

Below is the summary of the deal I passed out earlier this week. 



I have not closed on the 1Bcf supply purchase, but should have that done at 
the beginning of next week.  The gas price will be GDA-Mid for NGPL (La.) + 
$0.025.  This gas can be called upon hourly up to 50,000 MMBtu/day.  Example 
of the pricing mechanism (that NGPL prefers) is as follows:

Gas Nom  Gas Flow  Applicable Gas Daily Publication
Monday (intraday) Monday  Tuesday
Monday  Tuesday  Tuesday
Weekend  Weekend  Monday (unless Monday is a holiday, then Tuesday)

Let me know if you perfer a differnt structure.

Subject: ENA Adjustment at Nville

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.

Attached are two documents containing the regulatory summaries for this 
period.  The first is the same document you are used to seeing--a summary of 
all types of filings made by the pipelines to FERC.  The second is a special 
document that contains only the Order 637 compliance filings that have been 
made.  As I'm sure most of you are aware, each pipeline must make a filing 
indicating how it intends to comply with the new Order 637 regulations.  For 
your convenience I have included in the second attachment an explanation of 
the new Order 637 requirements, followed by the compliance filings that I 
have received to date.   I will update this document as new filings are 
received.  If you have any questions, I may be reached at x35514.

Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
    Pipeline Power Partners
    10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
    Houston, Texas 77024
    713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some
of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94.
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had
tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well
Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we
had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it
upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap
pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now
have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a
contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.

Conrad

Don't comfort yourself by saying things are better  for the Dow. Right now, 
half the earnings of the Dow comes from just six stocks  -- Minnesota Mining 
and Manufacturing, IBM, Johnson &  Johnson, ExxonMobil, Merck and United 
Technologies --  and most of those are defensive. So the Dow is functioning 
as a lagging  indicator of the failing economy. The Nasdaq is a far more 
sensitive barometer.  Don't ignore it just because it's giving you a weather 
forecast you don't like.

To all,

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and 
we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport: transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward
MGAF transport:  write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott 
as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:  Kam to review and explain
Annuity:    Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above
Alagasco:   Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position
Others:    As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be 
transferred for the
    account of Jared Kaiser
            Bank of America
           ABA 0011.....just kidding!  It comes from sitting by Sandra too 
long.

Kam - thanks for your help and let me know if you need my help.  As well, 
please reply if I have not covered all issues.


Regards,

Jared

Subject: Dominion Transmission, Inc., Upcoming TCRA Filing


On September 22, 2000, Dominion Transmission, Inc. ("DTI") and its customers 
(and interested state commissions) continued to meet to discuss DTI's 
upcoming TCRA filing to be submitted to FERC on September 29, 2000.  The 
customers had numerous questions for DTI about why its upcoming TCRA filing 
will result in such a large rate increase, and advised DTI that it needed to 
provide more information to the customers before they could make a meaningful 
response to DTI's settlement proposal made on September 15, 2000.

DTI opened the meeting by defending its upcoming TCRA filing as prudent, in 
accordance with FERC's prior orders on its TCRA mechanism, and legally 
defensible.  DTI then asked for responses to its settlement proposal made 
last week.  The basic feedback was that the customers "were not there yet."  
The customers said they were still interested in discussing settlement (in an 
effort to reduce the impact of the upcoming TCRA filing), but they wanted 
more of an explanation from DTI of its proposed substantial rate increase.

Much of the customer's questioning focused on DTI's "non-purchased" fuel 
supply (i.e., fuel gas DTI has borrowed from storage) and the continued 
growth in this element of its fuel supply mix over the past few years.  As of 
June 30, 2000, DTI has borrowed approximately 23 Bcf from storage for fuel 
use.

DTI also revealed that it had "liberated" approximately 13 Bcf of base 
storage gas over the last several years (i.e., reclassified base storage gas 
into working gas), and that this gas was "still on the system."  DTI said it 
had a $0.31 per MMBtu basis in this gas and that it was hoping to save it for 
a future storage project.   The liberated gas had not yet been reflected by 
DTI in its FERC reports or accounts.  Arguably, this gas has been parked in 
space being paid for by the customers and the customers are paying DTI a 
return on this gas.

During the bulk of the meeting the customers asked questions and DTI answered 
them.  DTI volunteered little; most information had to be extracted from its 
representatives.  The feeling of many of the customers was that DTI was not 
being forthright.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the customers said they wanted to ask more 
questions and would present DTI with their questions in the near future.  
Only after they have a better sense of the facts would the customers 
seriously entertain settlement offers.  Some customers expressed a desire for 
DTI to terminate its TCRA mechanism.  The customers also said the TCRA 
problems need to be addressed permanently so that there is not a "TCRA 
crisis" every year.

Accordingly, DTI will make its TCRA filing on September 29, 2000 seeking a 
cost increase of approximately $65 million.  It appears that the customers 
will protest the filing and await FERC action on the filing and protests.  In 
the meantime, another meeting to discuss these matters has been tentatively 
set for October 18, 2000 at 9:30 a.m. in Washington.  The meeting may be 
cancelled if the parties do not believe it would be useful to help resolve 
the issues at that time.

Please contact us if you have any questions about this matter.

Dear Wildca t Players and  Parents:

In planning for this Tuesday's game, it could  be damp and cold.
Therefore, in order to maximize the comfort of our players, I would
suggest:

1)  have a tight fitting leather or imitation leather glove (Jacob will be
using
    his baseball gloves).  The key is " tight and thin".

2) Extra (Thin) layer of clothing under uniform (Thermals work well). The
    Key is "tight and  thin layer".

3) Large oversize (cheap)  pancho - cut open in the front. The key is
"oversized"
   and easy on/off.

See you at practice tonight!
Go Wildcats!

Coach Butcher

I talked with Chris Holmes last week and got very positive feedback about 
your interviews.  I told him about our working together in Argentina 
and your activities down there and gave him an overview of your skill set.  I 
have left a message with Mike Moore but he is out of town 
and he has not returned my call yet.    
I hope all is well with you.  I will call or email when I talk with the 
others.

Sincerely,

Scott

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates 
and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will 
then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you 
don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with 
your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,

James is a neighbor and  good friend of mine.  He and his wife went to school 
with my wife.  Although I have never worked with James, my view is he is a 
marketer/originator/business developer.

Thanks fo the lead.  Just a couple of quick questions: (1) How well do you 
know James?  (2)  Depending upon your answer to #1, what type of role would 
you see him playing in an ENA group?

Hope all is well.

Mark,  
Attached is a revised memo.  The memo previously forwarded defined Bridgeline 
exclusive customers as those connected to interstate pipelines.  The correct 
definition of Bridgeline exclusive customers are those connected exclusively

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

Scott,
Thanks for taking the taking the time to talk with me.  I am following up 
with some additional information as I understand that you are representing me 
in the PRC process.

My Associate rotatation program  (24 months) ended on June 15, 2000. 

My third rotation was with Enron North America  with Tim Detmering (X 36973) 
which completed on March 1.  Then I rotated to EBS and worked with James Row 
(X58080) before joining Boris Brevnov permanently.  Boris Brevnov (5-7795) is 
nominating me for the Manager position in his group.

Please do not hesitate to call them for any feedback on my performance.
Thanks again.

Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
    Pipeline Power Partners
    10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
    Houston, Texas 77024
    713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some
of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94.
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had
tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well
Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we
had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it
upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap
pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now
have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a
contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.

Conrad

Kyle,

In late June, David Oliver gave me a final OA adjustment for the BUG deal.  
The figure he gave me was ($595,141).  We have not run this through the P&L 
yet because there are other outstanding issues that we expect to net out 
against this loss.  Could you provide a breakdown of this figure?  Colleen 
Sullivan has agreed to help the desk with final settlement of the BUG deal 
and we want to make sure that this OA figure does not include some other 
issues we are working on.  Please provide this breakdown to both Colleen and 
myself.

Thanks,
Kate

I am working with the EOL system development group on improving the reporting 
capabilities of EOL so that Internal EOL traders can personalised and save 
report formats.  Currently the system only saves the last report format.  If 
you have any ideas, thoughts or requests please let me know.
I have attached a file with examples of reports that can be generated.  The 
goal would be to give you the ability to view the information when you need 
it and in the required format.

Steve--Thanks.  This paper sheds alot of light on why Cal. is problematic.  
Jeff, Jim S., and I talked about it today because of Kevin's desire to be 
able to float his entire position against the pool and the reg. group idea 
that some "penalty" or separate charge should be attributed to those that 
cause the big congestion (primarily because of the Cal. problem that day of 
is cheaper than day ahead due to the caps.)

Christi,
 I found this to be a very interesting paper on the California Price Spikes.  
The conclusion is that price caps are infact creating part of the problem.

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their  
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp  
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce  
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able 
to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas  and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to 
grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical 
emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had 
hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating 
plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an 
electrical problem and into  a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and  electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating plants 
and  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, 
chief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  
organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. "You  
can't look at these things in isolation." 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  
of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. 
In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural 
gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are 
generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  
some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. 
But  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution 
when  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that 
power  plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was 
short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, 
including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now 
undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough 
to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers 
and  not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard 
last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic 
feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% 
less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million 
British thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are 
down about 8% from a year  ago. 

"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said  
John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of 
Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up  in the Northeast, 
based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two  weeks. 

High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. 
In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times 
the price a  year earlier.

Scott:

Greetings from LSU.  I sent you an email a few weeks ago, but perhaps you
didn't receive it.  No big deal.

I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.  My last
semester is shaping up to be pretty tough.  The MBA class in Real Options
is, to say the least, tough!  I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, and
so far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model,
risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo,
and pricing American, European, and exotic options.  What's also great
about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example
of how this stuff works in the real world.  It's a great class!

One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well,
because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time.
Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I need
to be doing.

I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlighting
lines on every page!  I figured I'd start with the less technical books
first, considering my workload.

I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/11
with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July.  Let me know
how your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together.

Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading
rotation that you spoke of is still a high probability.  As I'm learning
more about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think
trading is where I want to be!

Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.  I hope all is well in
Houston.

Kevin

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number.

Jeanie and I met with Scott Neal (VP Gas Trading East Desk)  yesterday and he 
mentioned that he needs an Analyst as soon as is possible.  Should I contact 
Jana Giovannini or do you send her our request?

Subject: Indian Guides Campout Feb. 16-18, 2001



Brother Butcher and I are still in need of a final list of who's in and
who's out for next weekend's Indian Guides camp-out at Brazos Bend state
park.  Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hr
away), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet other
commitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!!

To refresh your memories,  the itinerary for the weekend is get to the park
Friday after school and set up before dark.  (For those who need to go down
there later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will be
at the entrance to the park.)  Once we get there, the activities are
bicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boys
playing grab-ass in general.  THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNER
SATURDAY NIGHT,  A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT  AND
BREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.  For food purposes, we need to know an accurate
headcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help getting
your bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer
(or something).  We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lottery
tickets, ... when we get there.  Maps for those who need them will be
provided next week.

Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags,
flashlights,lanterns, etc.  Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks.
Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.  We'll make the
final call on that by Thursday.

To date, below is the headcount:

          Friday Night   Saturday Night

Fallick        ?         ?
Stehr          ?         Yes
Byrd      ?         Yes
Neal      ?         ?

Scott,

Attached below is the transport model I have been using for new deals.  It is 
set up right now for the Cranberry deal, but Kyle can show you how to modify 
it for any new deal.  Obviously, I have not been relying heavily on the 
extrinsic values this model produces.

Subject: ENA Adjustment at Nville

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.

    By Timothy Gardner
    NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Adding stress to an already
frazzled power market, a nationwide coal shortage could spawn
electricity brownouts in northeastern states and in the West
this summer, experts said on Thursday.
    While coal provides the country with 51 percent of its
power, years of industry underinvestment and record prices for
competing fuels natural gas and fuel oil this year have pushed
utilities' coal stocks to their lowest levels since 1974.
    In January, the last month of available government data,
stocks at electric plants were 94 million tons, 27 percent less
than a year earlier, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Department of Energy's number cruncher.
    Thin coal stocks compound a U.S. natural gas shortage that
led to rolling brownouts in California last winter. That came
after a failed deregulation plan and amid natural gas infrastructure
bottlenecks. Natural gas prices have fallen
from last summer's all-time highs, but are still nearly twice
what they were last year at this time.
    "In certain regions we would expect brownouts this summer,"
said Deck Sloan, spokesman for Arch Coal Inc. <ACI.N>, the
nation's second largest coal firm. "In California that seems to
be a very high likelihood, especially given the situation with
reservoir levels behind the hydro-dams in the West," he said.
    Los Angeles has avoided brownouts, largely because it has a
coal cache in Utah. L.A.'s power department is the largest
participant in the 1,600 megawatt (MW) Intermountain Power
Project in Utah. The project supplies L.A. with 14 percent of
its power and lesser amounts to nearby cities Anaheim and
Pasadena as well as parts of Utah.
    One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.
    Mike Nosanov, the operating agent of the 1,600 MW
Intermountain project, said the plant now has 700,000 tons of
coal, or 60 days supply. "That's more than enough to keep us
out of trouble this summer," he said.  Still, L.A. mayor
Richard Riordan has been meeting with Utah Governor Mike
Leavitt to discuss adding another 500 to 1,000 MW to the Utah
plant, though it would take years to add the capacity.

    OVERLOADED RAILROAD
    Another potential problem is stemming from the nation's
largest coal producing state, Wyoming, which delivers coal to
24 states.
    The two major railroads at Wyoming's Powder River Basin,
Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operate a joint
line out of the mines that has reached its capacity of 64
trains per day or more than 300 million tons per year.
    "The two lines could probably carry another 10 to 20
million tons (per year) out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin.
Beyond that it may take additional investment by the railroads
in order to get more production out of the basin," said Sloan.
    The Midwest is also thirsty for Wyoming coal. A proposal to
build a $1.4 billion coal rail project from Wyoming to power
plants in the Midwest is in the works.
    Hill and Associates, an independent industry consulting
firm, agrees that Wyoming coal trains are at their limits, a
problem that will take years to solve. "The question is who is
going to make the investment?" asked Hill and Associates Vice
President John Hanou. "The mines or the railroads?"

    COAL DROUGHT ALL OVER
    Northeastern states, where years of production
underinvestment has led to thin stocks, are also in danger,
said Arch Coal's Sloan. "We could also see the Northeast, if
the summer is normal or hotter than normal, suffer brownouts as
well," he said.
    Adding to the mix, Massey Energy <MEE.N>, the nation's
seventh-largest coal company, experienced flooding last month
in one of its major mines in Appalachia.
    "In this current atmosphere, that is a hell of a big story,
said Jim Thompson, general manager of Energy Publishing, a Hill
and Associates affiliate.
    And the EIA reported utilities so far this year are burning
six percent more coal than last year. Prices on the spot market
have jumped, though long-term contracts make up 80 percent of
coal deals, which mean consumers will mostly be protected from
rising prices.
    But utilities may find themselves scrambling for coal. "As
far as we can tell there is no coal available anywhere," warned
a Hill and Associates supply report this spring.
    "Brownouts are possible," said Lehman Brothers coal analyst
Peter Ward. "Utilities have gotten complacent. Coal has been a
buyer's market for about two decades. That has suddenly changed
in the past three months, and for many utilities with low
inventories, that is a scary situation."
    Analysts said high coal prices should eventually spur
increased production of the fuel, and new natural gas and coal
plants will eventually clear up brownout threats. "But we're
not going to see much capacity come on line for at least three
years," said Hanou.

For your background and heads-up, we understand that the U.S. Senate is very 
close to agreement on a pipeline safety bill and it may be voted on by the 
full Senate as early as Wednesday evening.  Although this bill pre-dates the 
pipeline explosion in New Mexico and is not directly linked to it, the 
tragedy seems to have hastened the progress of this proposed bill.  We 
suspect that when approved in the Senate, this bill may draw press coverage 
and create some headlines, though the focus of the media attention and the 
reaction of gas trading markets--if any-- sems hard to predict.  One possible 
"market-moving" aspect of this legislation may be the announced increased 
costs that will need to be borne by pipeline operators in the future to fund 
new R&D and new safety measures.  

The main points of this bill are:

The bill would impose several new requirements on pipeline operators 
regarding inspection methods and community "right to know."  The language 
specifically allows for "periodic assessment of the integrity of the pipeline 
through methods including internal inspection, pressure testing, direct 
assessment, or other effective methods."

The bill would allow greater state authority over interstate pipes, with 
coordination between state and local officials and the Office of Pipeline 
Safety.  OPS will remain the controlling authority in matters of pipeline 
safety.

It would provide more R&D money and authorize an increase in user fees over 
the next two years.   

Cost assessment:  the legislation will increase operators' day-to-day costs 
and impose greater user fees.   Based on the calls for greater R&D, and for 
better OPS/DOT inspection capabilities in the future, we can expect 
appropriations in the next few fiscal years to be targeted for substantial 
increases -- most of which will come out of user fees paid by pipelines.

Political assessment:   Apparently the changes made to the bill in recent 
weeks reflect a number of the arguments Enron has been making in negotiations 
to make the McCain bill more palatable.  Even in the face of the El Paso 
incident, the Enron Political Affairs staff has reportedly been able to make 
meaningful changes to what was previously an unacceptable piece of 
legislation.  In the assessment of the Enron DC office, it is certainly in 
the best interests of the industry to lobby for its passage, given the 
political uncertainties of a new Congress in 2001 -- it would not be 
beneficial to have to re-start our negotiations from scratch next year.

In the House of Representatives:  The House has its own pipeline safety bill 
pending.  It remains to be seen whether the leadership will push for this 
bill (which will require reconciliation with the Senate bill before it can 
become a law), or whether the House will just adopt the bill that comes out 
of the Senate.  With only about four weeks left in the congressional session, 
final passage of a bill out of Congress will likely come only at the end of 
the session in October.

Ted,

Jeanie and I met with Scott Neal (VP Gas Trading East Desk)  yesterday and he 
mentioned that he needs an Analyst as soon as is possible.  Should I contact 
Jana Giovannini or do you send her our request?  

Thanks,
Jennifer

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract 
later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we 
haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already 
at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  
If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and 
associates arrive and do a session then.

Everything is good here. Gary has been with Enron for quite a while.  Most 
recently, he managed interest rate and foreign exchange/currency risk.  You 
should give him a call or email.  

Besitos a las chicas de Filo.

Suerte,

Scott

Hey Scott,
How is the East Desk doing?I can imagine that things are rolling over there. 
Do you know this new guy assigned to trading Ag. commodities Gary Hickerson? 
I would really like to get in touch with him. What do you think.

Trying to make things roll down here.

I've renegotiated the 400,000 MMBtu/day supply area deal on NGPL.  The 
primary delivery points have not changed. The new (receipt) paths, volumes 
and rates are below.  I'll forward the actual receipt points along with the 
amended contract once complete.  Essentially, this new structure 
significantly reduces our commodity costs to points west of 346 and slightly 
reduces (50%) commodity costs east of 346.  Please remember that secondary 
deliveries to points east of 346 (with the exception of Sonat Erath) still 
include a volumetric (demand) adder $0.02 Dth for STX receipts and $0.025 for 
all other receipts.   Deliveries to Sonat Erath will be an additional $0.02 
MMbtu.  Let me know if you have any issues ASAP.  I want to make this 
effective August 1.

Also,  she will want to know what area(s) (eg. accounting, marketing,

 Hey there, this is Chris Graeter.  I wanted to check with you to see about
getting in touch with the person in charge of internships.  I am sure he or
she is busy, but in the mean time I was not sure if you or the person who
would be contacting me had my email address.  It is cgraeter@tamu.edu.  I
know that sometimes it is easier to get in touch with someone by email so I
wanted to make sure you had this information.  Thank you again for all your

Todd,

I am available for fishing with you on Sept.8. On the 8 Sept. when you
arrive, I will take you to fish and we can discuss what type of deep fishing
you want. It is no problem getting a guide if I can not take you deep
fishing. This is a slow season and a lot of tour guides are available. You
do not need to bring any equipment. We have any kind you need. Are you
staying at Holiday Hotel ? I will speak to you on the day of your arrival.
Hope to see you soon.

I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students 
that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating.  
 I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her 
and I agree with your comments. 

Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought 
might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option 
Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading 
that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock 
Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have 
read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It 
is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A 
must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.

Sincerely,

Scott Neal

Hi Geynille and Scott,

I wanted to thank you for lunch today and tell you how much I enjoyed
meeting you.  Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make
our classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.  We
appreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable
contribution.

One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later in
the day to tell me about her Enron interviews.  Milagros was very excited
about Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.  I want to
offer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.  Milagros is one of the
most impressive students I have ever taught.  While her GPA (3.9) is
sufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on her
intangible qualities.  Milagros is mentally tough, hard working,
determined, and ambitious.  Just as important, she is a genuinely nice
person.  She deals with people very well and possesses what I would
describe as quiet leadership characteristics.  In other words,  she leads
by example and by reason.  I also find her to be mature beyond her age and
willing to assume responsibility for her own choices.  In short, I think
Milagros would be an asset to any organization.

Again,  it was good meeting you.  Please fell free to contact me if I can
help you in any way.

Regards,

Chip Ryan

Linda, our first wellhead book day trade; gas daily for the weekend was 
$8.175.  I'd also ultimately like to fix the price for the remainder of the 
month, but I don't want to take a "long term position" without more input 
from management.

Will, consistent with the tickets we provided you earlier today, you entered 
the following deals with the volumes indicated in the column "11/28/00 
Tickets":


Tennessee    11/28/00    10/26/00
     Tickets    Quote

Baseload
Cabot:  #505762    11,280     9,136
D2D:  #505910

Swing:
Cabot:  #505855    2,820     2,284
D2D:  #505913

Transco

Baseload
Cabot:  #505870    14,720     14,400
D2D:  #505892

Swing
Cabot:  #505880    3,680     3,600
D2D:  #505902


But, the volumes cited in the tickets prepared today were not consistent with 
the volumes for which the East Desk originally provided price quotes based on 
the volumes we cited on 10/26/00.  I have spoken with Scott Neal and he is 
agreeable to allowing us to amend the Sitara deals to reflect the 10/26/00 
volumes rather than the 11/28/00 volumes.  Please, therefore, substitute the 
Quoted volumes for the Ticketed volumes on the 8 deals listed above.  Thanks 
much.

I have prepared and attach herewith revised tickets.

Subject: Comments on August 15 Order 637 Filings

Attached are initial comments of ENA which were filed Thursday in the Order 
637 Compliance Filings of the indicated pipelines.  For all other pipelines, 
we filed plain interventions.


Objected to "use it or lose it" provision on alternate primary points on 
segmented capacity.


Protested no tolerance on imbalance based on highest or lowest daily price in 
the month.


Protested additional charge to create a primary point on segmented capacity, 
forced daily balancing service, and change from unauthorized overrun penalty 
(which is credited) to a service which is not.  Requested technical 
conference.


Same as Tennessee

Subject: Guaranteeing Index Minus Gas  

Scott,
I am talking to DTI (CNGT) regarding an Index minus sale for April-01 
through  June-01 of up to 4 Bcf.  
I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about 
achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbedding an option.  I am not 
supposed to know about DTI's potential purchase requirements, so I changed 
the quantities and months in the example below, since the plan is to take 
this to her boss.
Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it better.

Tammi,
As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guarantee 
you IF-FOM Index Gas you can take to Michelle.

Example:  Note: All prices are notional non-transactable numbers.  
DTI requires a total of 610,000 DT in April and May as a 10,000 DT/d baseload 
purchase.

ENA Proposal would guarantee DTI IF-FOM Index Minus Gas by embedding an 
option (Put or Call) into the deal for say 5,000 DT/d.
Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915,000 DT (in the case of 
the put) or as little as 305,000 DT (in the case of a call) then ENA can take 
the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas.

Let us say; ENA is currently offered at IF - CNG App Index for  April and May 
@ Index +2 cents, and agrees to sell DTI Index  -2 cents; ENA has lost 4 
cents or $0.04 * 610,000 = $24,400.
However, if we price in the value of a call option with a strike price of the 
FOM Index, then that would generate $0.10 * 5,000 * 61 days= $30,500. ENA 
would use this value to offset the Index loss and make a small margin on the 
sale.  Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas, however must have the 
flexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity.  
Remember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI will 
receive only the baseload quantity.  If ENA exercises the option everyday 
then DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of 
Index -2 cents.

This can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed 
the option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth 
month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month 
period.  Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option 
will generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you would like me to do a 
conference call with Michelle just let me know.

Thanks,
Sean

Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed
to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron.  The total 
dollars
required was approximately $4.25 million.  An amount of $3.55 million needed 
for 
the Transco historical imbalance resolution.  The remaining balance was needed
for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention 
last year.

Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical 
imbalance.
The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional 
funds
for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under "The Office of 
the
Chairman".  Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money 
to
be reserved at the "Chairman" level since the additional funds were needed to 
correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L.  
Also, the 
arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement 
payments
were made by Enron.

As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news.  First, the 
bad news.
After a great deal of investigation, it appears that there currently is no 
reserve at the
"Office of the Chairman"  for these additional funds.  Now, the good news.  
Georgeanne 
will take the necessary steps to make sure there is money available so that 
we can
quickly resolve these issues with Keyspan and Transco.

If you have questions, please give me a call.

Kam, last year when this deal was set up, I set up deal tickets extending 
into the future for 5 years (I would have extended it all the way to 2010 but 
the Risk people back then asked me not to).  I have a new ticket for each 
season since the volumes at each primary point and fuel change over the years 
and by season.  Extending Sitara 217969 through is going to be doubling 
volumes for one and secondly, it won't reflect the correct primary points for 
each season.  I would really like to be consulted about these kind of changes 
before they are made and maybe we and Scott Neal could sit down and figure 
out a better way to keep up with the value.  I'll run some facilitation 
reports and see if this has caused us any trouble that we may need to fix.

Thanks, Sabra

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal 
(2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and 
locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you 
have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge 
deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  
Sorry for the trouble.

Calpine-EMI wants to get a bid from us on a spread option on their Tiverton 
plant in Tiverton, Rhode Island for Sept 1, 00 through Dec 31, 00.  (Tiverton 
apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)  I will be 
pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no 
later than end of this week.  They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities 
including us.  Here are some details FYI:

Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas
Power qty = 250 MW
Power strike = $45/Mwh
Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an 
implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh
Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu
Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity 
rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral
Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than 
95%
Gas firmness:  secondary firm

Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any 
feedback on the degree of "strategic fit" this position would provide us.  
Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece 
and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous 
customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit 
off).  Thanks all

John

FRANCE:
PDVSA sees Enron LNG deal soon, seeks gas funds.

06/07/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

NICE, France, June 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) said on Wednesday it expected to sign a contract with U.S.
energy company Enron by June 30 to construct an LNG plant in Jose with an
annual capacity of two million tonnes.

It has signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell , ExxonMobil and Mitsubishi
to begin construction of a four-million-tonne LNG plant in Paria by end of the
year.
"We could sign the contract to start the project (with Enron) by June 30...The
plant should be operational by 2004," Domingo Marsicobetre, chairman of
PDVSA's gas division, told reporters at the world gas congress in Nice.

"The project development agreement was signed with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi
last month. In September we will declare the viability of the project and then
create a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone is
December," Marsicobetre said.

The Paria plant was expected to be operational by 2005, he said, adding that
the consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco delta
platform, south of Trinidad, to add a second and third train to the plant. "In
August a decision will be taken by the shareholders," he said.

PDVSA would supply associated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also be
a shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbean and the
United States, he said.

The Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States,
Spain and Portugal.

Marsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeking between $6 billion and $10 billion in
private investment to develop the production of non-associated gas, its LNG
projects and the Venezuelan gas grid.

Expanding non-associated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent of
that total sum while the two LNG facilities would need some $2.6 million. The
cost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was not
included in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters.

"If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment," Mava said.

He said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with proven
reserves of 146 trillion cubic feet (tcf), was counting on the development of
non-associated gas to meet rising domestic demand.

Venezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 2009, rising to
4.2 billion cubic feet a day from the current level of 1.8 billion. That meant
the percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 55 percent from 42, Mava
said.

Of the current 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was associated and 14 non-associated.
But there were unexplored reserves of non-associated gas of 6-20 tcf onshore
and 40-60 offshore, he said.

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy

Subject: Tennessee Purchase of Physical Gas

Scott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.  
There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about 
financial transactions.  I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a 
forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against 
them too much.

Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to 
maintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first 
come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas 
trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a 
fuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their 
transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.  

The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so 
Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report 
its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however, 
have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases 
they make for balancing.  If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate 
for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue 
could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.  Purchases made for 
system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed 
in the next rate case.

         Fifth Revised Sheet No. 209A
                           Schedule LMS - MA
                        Load Management Service - Market Area (continued)
   
   
                  (ii)  Operational Transactions:  Operational Transactions 
are those
                        Operational Purchases and Operational Sales which 
Transporter may from
                        time to time, in its discretion, enter into with 
third parties to
                        balance Transporter's system and to maintain 
operational integrity.
                        Pursuant to this Section 7(g)(ii),  Transporter may 
purchase gas
                        quantities for receipt into its system and may sell 
gas quantities for
                        delivery out of its system.  These Operational 
Transactions may be
                        conducted on a first-come/first-served basis at 
posted prices, or
                        pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading 
system, or
                        negotiated directly with third parties.
   
                        The Operational Transactions utilized to reconcile

Net Cashout
                        Activity, then an additional month of Operational 
Transactions, ending
                        on September 30, thirteen months after the start of 
the Annual Cashout
                        Period, shall be included in the Cashout Report in 
order to reconcile
                        Net Cashout Activity.  Gas quantities from an 
Operational Transaction

Cashout Report
                        cannot be used to offset cashout activity in a 
subsequent Cashout
                        Report.
   
                  (iii) Annual Cashout Report:  Transporter shall include in

the report.
                        Transporter will include a list in the Cashout Report 
of all
                        Operational Purchases and Operational Sales 
transactions by month
                        during the applicable Annual Cashout Period, plus the

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and 
Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to 
have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in 
Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your 
reference.

thanks,

Scott

I would like to take out Tina Harmon at Cng Producing to the spa one 
afternoon this month.   Cng always gives me the majority of her Destin gas 
both term and spot and they have been very flexible with us moving the nomin 
around both intraday and next day.     I wanted to show my appreciatiion, not 
that I wouldn't love a a tript o the spa!

Is that okay with you?   thanks.

Scott,

Attached below is the transport model I have been using for new deals.  It is 
set up right now for the Cranberry deal, but Kyle can show you how to modify 
it for any new deal.  Obviously, I have not been relying heavily on the 
extrinsic values this model produces.

Scott: Barry called me this morning and asked if we would want to get the
stumps ground of the trees removed in the yard. He said the tree man had a
relative that would do it for a $70 set up fee plus $5 per stump (approx 14
stumps). The tree man will deduct this off of what he owes us for the trees.
I told Barry to go ahead as it needs to be done and the price is right.

Subject: Tennessee Purchase of Physical Gas

Scott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.  
There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about 
financial transactions.  I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a 
forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against 
them too much.

Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to 
maintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first 
come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas 
trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a 
fuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their 
transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.  

The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so 
Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report 
its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however, 
have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases 
they make for balancing.  If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate 
for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue 
could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.  Purchases made for 
system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed 
in the next rate case.

Scott,

Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David 
Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to 
mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the 
interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been 
pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and 
is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need 
me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be 
happy to help.

Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want 
to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought 
is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may 
be tough to get him back.

Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back 
from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

Kim

Just called - can come in on Weds 23rd ( reason why he can't come in earlier 
- vacation from 16th to 19th ) . Still interested in talking - simply a 
scheduling issue - don't seem to be any barriers to moving forward.

They have just moved office - hence new number (7139890962)

Does the 23rd work ?

I didn't mention the Scott Neal call.

Rockhounds & parents,
?
Hey everyone, I've finally got the pre-season game  schedule.? I've attached 
the latest overall schedule (rev 2,?and in a  earlier version of Excell so 
hopefully it can be easily opened).? Please  let me know if this is a format 
problem for anyone, I can fax it and/or mail it  if you'll let me know.
?
Basically the changes are that our games next week are  Tuesday (6:00 pm 
gametime?at Memorial Middle School field #3) and  Thursday (8:00 pm gametime 
at Spring Forest Field #2, our  regular practice field)? Also, I've upped the 
practice start time  next Saturday to 8:30 am going?till 10:30 (since our  
game?Tuesday the 6th will?wipe out our practice)?and corrected  the error on 
the time for the March 10th practice (thanks Trisha).? If  these games are 
rained out they will not be made up.
?
By the way, I've got a practice scheduled for the March 10th  but I'm sure 
some will be out since that's the first part of SBISD spring  break.? Please 
let me know how many will be able to attend.
?
I don't think this really applies to anyone on our team, by  just fyi:? the 
league has requested that parents not drop their kids off in  front of the 
fields (by driving down the dirt trail).? There is too much  kid traffic and 
they're worried about accidents.? Just keep to the parking  lot.
?
See everyone this Tuesday at 7:30.
?
thanks,
Jeff

The first invoice for $5.4 million went out a couple of weeks ago.  CES came 
back to us and said they were not going to pay.  They claimed that the total 
of all of the invoices to this date that they have already paid had covered 
that amount.  I have researched all of their invoices, and it looks like 
there was a demand invoice in the system for the month of June for 
approximately $6 million to much.  CES incorporated a credit for that invoice 
in with the charge for $5.4 million, netting out to approximately $600,000.  
I am meeting with CES on Thursday to see if we are in agreement.  The other 
invoice for $7.5 million was sent out last week, CES is in agreement and the 
payment should be here shortly.
   If you have any questions don't hesitate to call me.

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=

basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=
ur=20
Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=
ing=20
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal=

regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=

on=20
companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, =

Subject: Reliant Energy-Entex -- Large Volume Contract Customers Agreements

Hello Scott,

I recently received a request from Entex to provide a list of active 
contracts between ENA and Reliant Entex.  I have come across a file 
containing more than one contract for them, specifically the Natural Gas 
Services Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001983, dated 
9/1/93), and the Natural Gas Sales Agreement - Large Volume Contract 
Customers (96001980, dated 9/1/93).  By letters from you dated 2/21/97, both 
of these contracts' terms were extended to 3/31/00. Additionally, there is a 
letter dated 1/13/00 extending the term of the Services Agreement 
to10/31/02.  I would like to know if there was a 1/13/00 letter extending the 
term of the Sales Agreement.  If there was, I need to get a copy for the 
file, and make the amendment in Global Contracts.

Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Susan Elledge

Scott:

This is very kind of you and I really appreciate it very much.  I shall phone 
you to thank you on behalf of my family and myself as a stop gap measure till 
I am back from India by 1st week of December to thank you in person.

The lawyer has asked me to compile all the letters, thus kindly send it by 
internal mail to Amr Ibrahim, EB4737B.  Finally, strange as it might sound, 
the lawyer has spelled my first name in the letter wrongly as "Amir", and I 
wonder if there is still time to correct it to "Amr" without the "i".  If 
this is a bit late, then it is fine as it stands.  

Once more, thank you very, and I really appreciate it.

Very best regards

Scott:

I hope that all is well.  India is still going strong with additional 
involvement in commodity trading (electricity, fuels...etc.)  

Please advice of the best time to phone you this week to seek your help in 
reference to compiling letters of recommendation for the Green Card 
application.  The application, supported by Enron, will be under the "Alien 
of Extraordinary Ability" Category.   I am sure that your recommendation will 
go a very long way and I am hopeful that you will agree to help.  

I am enclosing the email I received from the lawyer and the sample letter 
suggested. I am trying to highlight--where the lawyer indicated--the attempts 
to safeguard and promote US investment in Argentina,  the rapport I had with 
the various echelons of authority in that country, and shed light on 
character and ability.  Please feel free to add/delete as you see fit and 
advice of any comments and/or suggestions.    

Needless to say, and regardless of outcome, I really appreciate your help and 
advice.

Hey guys, I spoke with Carol and told her we would have an overview for ENA 
by next Friday. Could each of you e-mail me a brief summary of your business 
in Florida- just give me a general idea of our level of involvement in your 
market, general themes we might want to get across, hurdles, etc. Ben/Jim, 
this may be a very good opportunity to have Kevin lay out our views/plans for 
deregulation and power development, and what we would like to see the 
Governor push in the state. Since Enron is in Texas (and the obvious 
connection with the Bush brothers), if it's appropriate to use Texas 
deregulation as an example/comparable with Florida, it might be interesting. 
If I could get your responses by next Wednesday am, they would be great. 
Thanks.

Kevin Hannon is attending a dinner and a breakfast meeting (November 8th and 
9th) with Governor Jeb Bush in Florida.  At this meeting the Governor has 
requested that the attendees give a three to five minute overview of their

see if you if could please give him a brief update via email on ENA's

Subject: ENA Adjustment at Nville

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.


Call me if there are any questions.

I definately support  a promotion.  I have not given up on the contract, 
although I have not figured out how to make it more palatable for her while 
ensuring 
she is committed to Enron.

Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment 
Contract.  I understand her issues.  Even before she informed me of her 
decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to 
Director.  I would like to get your thoughts on this.

Frank

I am ok with intraday recall, however this should be agreed to by the parties 
to the capacity release deal.  In other words, the parties should have the 
flexibility to make deals to include intraday recall rights or not.

Please see Gary's memo below.  Basically, Gary needs to know ASAP whether we 
have changed our stance on partial day capacity releases.  In the past, we 
have been against partial day recalls of capacity; however, with the growing 
need for on peak, off peak service, have we changed our stance?  There are 
obviously pros and cons to both approaches--we just need to agree on what we 
want our official stance to be.  Please advise ASAP.

Subject: LDC's Concern with Order 637 & GISB

Donna, As per your request, the attached is from the GISB comments filed by 
Keyspan, National Fuel and the AGA about Capacity release issues on Order 637 
and what GISB did or did not address in its evaluation of the FERC Order 637 
changes needed for the Current Capacity Release Standards. I have only 
researched the requests that have to do with Recall, Right to do Partial day 
Releases and Partial Day Recall. 
As you know, these have  been added to a Two day BPS meeting in Colorado 
Springs next week (OCT 10 & 11),  which I will be attending. At the last EC 
meeting the LDC's wanted this issue sent to FERC, By GISB, as an issue that 
needs further clarity from FERC before standards can be structured. The EC 
asked for guidance from the members and it was suggested by the EC members to 
send this issue back to the BPS committee for further discussion, with a 
commitment from the LDC's to have parties in attendance. Then BPS was to 
present a report, on progress, to the EC at the OCT 13th meeting. 
In my report I have Questions that are asking for guidance from management of 
any changes to our historical policy on Capacity Release and GISB standards.

Scott,
I know James McCord personally.  He used to work for Coastal, as part of the 
fuels marketing group.  I have worked with him in the past.  Do you know what

I would like to know if  I could take a class in the fall from 7:00- 8:15 
a.m. ?  I would be in at 8:30 and it would be two days a week .  I would stay 
late to make up for that time. Rain comes in at 7:30 and Felecia gets here at 
8:00, so the phones would be covered.  Please let me know as soon as 
possible, as registration is this week.

Thanks

Scott,
  Please let your gas traders know that Inside FERC will not accept bidweek
prices via fax any later than 2 p.m. Eastern time. It takes a great deal of 
time
to input each deal by hand and then re-check the data for accuracy -- and 
that's
before we even begin to analyze each pricing point to determine the indexes.
  If anyone has any questions, they can contact me at the number below.

Doug Leach called me about this.  Could one of your guys call this guy and 
see if there is anything we can do to help him.  He is a friend of Doug's and 
will give us the business if we are competitive.  Supposedly he has a very 
favorable fixed price offter from a competitor, so I think it is a fishing 
expedition.

Thanks,

Tom
