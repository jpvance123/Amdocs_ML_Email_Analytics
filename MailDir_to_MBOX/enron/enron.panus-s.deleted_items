The documentation they sent does not show that Sequent Energy Management, LLC became Sequent Energy Management, L.P.  The documents they sent show that 1) Sequent Energy Management, LLC changed its name to Sequent, LLC, 2) Sequent Energy, LP changed its name to Sequent Energy Management, LP, and 3) Sequent, LLC is the general partner of Sequent Energy Management, L.P.  I have left a message for the individual who sent the documents to us.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

The alternate letter of credit format is fine.  With respect to his other question on the collateral rounding, what is your thought on this?  If you let me know, we will respond to Gary Ross.

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Attached for your review is a draft of the ISDA Master Agreement between

forms from ISDA and cannot be sent electronically.  Therefore, I am also
sending you the entire package via overnight delivery.

If you have any questions, please call me at the below number or Brent

Good Afternoon,
	Enclosed is a worksheet for BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, LP.  This document should be the same as BP Capital Energy Fund LP and BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, LP, which are industrial masters.  Please forward executable documents to Mike Larson at BP Capital.  
	Stephanie is currently putting together an omnibus confirm for existing trades done last week, but these will roll up to the master once it is executed.  Give me a call with any questions.  

Thanks,
Max

Below is an email from TranAlta Energy Marketing (U.S.) Inc. ("TransAlta") regarding their merger with Merchant Energy Group of the Americas, Inc. ("MEGA").  TransAlta is the surviving entity and they propose to assign the existing ISDA Master between ENA and MEGA from MEGA to TransAlta.  ECC has an ISDA Master with TransAlta, but I think it is a different TransAlta entity.  Please review the below and let us know how you want to proceed.

I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I need to get an ISDA set-up with Delphi Automotive (NYSE DPH). Ken Curry is looking into credit limits. As soon as you have it ready, thanks for forwarding to me the two copies (I am now located in Enron South at 04848). I want to forward it with other documents to the client.

Many Thanks

Below is an email from TranAlta Energy Marketing (U.S.) Inc. ("TransAlta") regarding their merger with Merchant Energy Group of the Americas, Inc. ("MEGA").  TransAlta is the surviving entity and they propose to assign the existing ISDA Master between ENA and MEGA from MEGA to TransAlta.  ECC has an ISDA Master with TransAlta, but I think it is a different TransAlta entity.  Please review the below and let us know how you want to proceed.

I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.  He mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to get that approved by Credit.

Cindy,

On April 25, 2001, Enron Corp. issued a guaranty (gty2997) in favor of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, Inc. ("PacifiCorp") to guaranty the obligations of ECC.  ECC and PacifiCorp are now entering into an ISDA Master Agreement.  Under the ISDA Master Agreement, the Guaranty is being amended to increase the amount to $25 mil., and we will be required to provide certificates for Enron Corp.

Attached is the Amendment to Guaranty and the related Enron Corp. certificates that are needed.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Hi, Stephanie

VCM has an office in bermuda and in Houston ... you will tend to deal with
the Houston office most of the time on trading, invoicing and collateral
matters.

I trust that this answers your question

      Hello, Stephanie,

      I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your
      email/attachments
      fo 24 July.

      Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope
   that
      once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
      implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ...
   I
      expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the
      address
      details and a few other similar minor items.

      Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

Elaine,
I am attaching clean and blackline versions of the Fourth Amended and
Restated Guaranty from FPL Group Capital to Enron entities, incorporating
the  changes requested by Enron.  Please confirm that you are comfortable
with  the modification in paragraph 2 of assuming responsibility that Enron
actually receives your notice in the event that you desire to terminate the
Guaranty.  As always, please do not hesitate to call with any  questions.

Enclosed is an ISDA worksheet for Panaco Inc.  They are very interested, as are many right now, in getting an ISDA in place that has netting language between financial transactions and physical gas.  Physical gas is done both at ENA and ENA Upstream Company LLC.  Can we put together such a document?  If there are any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Max

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Agustin Perez is wanting to send out a confirmation for YD9296.1 (currently booked to the old name Petrotemex, S.A. de C.V.) by this afternoon, if at all possible.

Do we have enough "lead time" to get this out today?


Thanks,
Gordon

Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via email or at the number below.

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

That all sounds great to me!

I'm going out tonight and won't be back in until late most likely so I can't
call tonight.

I'll just coordinte with Nance and I'm sure that you guys will be talking.
If we don't do something Friday, then let's defintely do something next
week/end.

If you do go out of town - have a great time.  And have a good holiday!

That sounds like fun.  We might be out of town for the weekend.  Raymond's
friend has some land about halfway between Dallas and Houston.  We were
thinking of going up Thurs night or Fri morning.  If we do go out of town,
we need to get together next week(end). Give me a call.  We'll be around
tonight.

   Hey Steph!

   I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
   travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it
   was
   Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

   How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

   I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
   weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time
   and I
   like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if
   that's
   alright.

   I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be
   strange
   b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's
   thinking
   but now saying - you know what I mean?

   My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't
   recall
   my cell right now.

   We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and
   bitch
   about the idiots we both work with!!!

   Let me know what's up!

   Jenn

   Hey, Jen,
   What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to
   have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of
   junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey & Michael are
   going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office
   these days.

Stephanie,
 
Please send forward your preliminary memo to me concerning PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.  If you sent one earlier, I never received it.
 
It is vital that we get these memos because it signals us to check EOL immediately as to whether or not we have to set up a shell agreement for a contract number so the counterparty can do on-line trading. 
 
Thanks,

Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of "Representative" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Thanks and best regards,

Hey guys-
BASF is still not showing up as legal reviewing even thought Wendi approved on 10/16. Please make sure that this gets on to Tana, so that we can get this ID out ASAP.

Thanks!

Jennifer:

BASF slipped by.  I really thought I had taken care of that one, but I will have it completed this morning.  FYI: sometimes Credit has completed its part and Legal needs to review.  Until PCG flips the status to "Legal Reviewing" the status will still reflect "Credit Reviewing".  This usually happens intraday, as PCG is diligent about updating the status field.

Wendi,
Just wondering if things are moving ok from credit to legal in the pa database, as I seem to keep running into cps that your comment says credit approved, but the status is still at credit reviewing....
The latest is BASF Corporation. Can you make sure this moves on to legal? Gracias!

We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.

Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.

Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as "Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch"

MUCH THANKS!!!

Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Thanks for the certificates.  I have one more question.  What is the W-8BEN form for?  Do we normally complete and sign this on ISDA agreements?  I don't believe I've encountered one before.

Hi, Stephanie,

I wanted to check where we are on the ISDA ... we sent you a proposal at the
end of Sept, and you and I have exchanged a couple of emails since then, but
overall I believe that the ball is still ' in your court'.  Is this correct?

Regards, David

Sara,
I have tracked down James Canney in London, who works with ECTRIC's brokerage/futures matters.  They do have an agreement with Carr, but do not have a copy of the agreement.  He is trying to get a copy from Carr.

Stephanie, Carr have come back to me and say they have some kind of contract with Enron Capital and Trade International but the person I spoke to needs managerial approval to send me a copy.
The manager is my normal contact so will hopefully be able to get a copy tomorrow...

Can you confirm whether or not ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr Futures and what the date of such agreement is?  We need to provide Carr with an Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Please find attached the credit worksheet for OESC.  Please be advised this is for a draft ISDA and for discussion purposes only as you will see from my credit worksheet that the cross default amount is still to be determined as I did not have access to the company financial statements while I am up here working in Portland.  Please prepare the draft ISDA and forward it onto Paul DeVries and Chris Gaffney for their further handling.

 


Thank you

 <<Enron ISDA 9 21 01.doc>> 
There has been some confusion on this ISDA/CSA since originally there was no electronic version.  I have tried to incorporate all comments into this electronic document.  Please make all written comments directly on this document.   If you prefer, you may call me to discuss comments at (302) 455-9282.
There are no comments on the Guaranty.  I have received two different guaranty versions from Enron. In my last phone conversation with Darren Vanek on 8/8/01, Darren indicated he was going to talk to Stephanie about providing one guaranty for both financial and physical transactions.

Kim and Dan,
In an effort to come to closure on the one final issue I propose the follow=
ing language. =20
"(e)=09Payments on Early Termination.  For the purpose of Section 6(e):  (i=
) Market Quotation shall apply to natural gas and crude oil Transactions wi=
th a remaining term at the time of the Early Termination of less than one y=
ear and Loss will apply to all other Transactions, and (ii) the Second Meth=
od will apply."

I believe that this provision would cover the vast majority of SAC's trades=
 with Enron which are the types of trades which Enron considers most liquid=
.  This also addresses our concern of not having to obtain quotations on il=
liquid positions.  We would be willing to modify the Loss definition as set=
 forth below (as proposed in my last email) which also addresses some of yo=
ur concerns with the standard version of the Loss definition (while recogni=
zing that it does not address all your concerns).  We believe this to be a =
fair compromise that attempts to address the concerns of both parties.  Ple=
ase review the proposal and let me know if we can send a final blacklined c=
opy of the agreement for your review.

Regards,
Brent=20

=20
"The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo=
llows:=20

"Loss" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran=
sactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equival=
ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co=
mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which =
case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection wi=
th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra=
nsactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the ele=
ction of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a res=
ult of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge =
or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to =
be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re=
placement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of =
funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidati=
ng, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Fu=
rthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees =
and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will dete=
rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is no=
t reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab=
ly practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference=
 to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers=
 in the relevant market."

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Stephanie,

As discussed, attached below is the revised credit worksheet for Copamex (for the threshold matrix).  However, please note that the Enron Corp. gty already sent to Copamex for $15MM will remain active and tied to this ISDA (disregard the $20MM gty in the worksheet).

Thanks--Veronica

Francisco,

Per my message, attached is a newly revised worksheet that should meet our credit needs.  


Jaime--if the counterparty continues to dispute, we need to receive audited year end 2000 financials and 2001 quarterly financial position reports to reevaluate.


Thanks,

Veronica

Afternoon,
	Enclosed is an amended worksheet for Ineos Acrylics Inc.  We sent a draft under a different name a couple of months ago.  This entity will be guaranteed by the ultimate parent as described in the worksheet.  Please prepare this draft and forward to Eric and Graham at Ineos, with a copy to me.  
	Give me a call with any questions.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

Hey, Jen,
What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey & Michael are going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office these days.

Unfortunately the appointment schedule for flu shots this week is completely full.  You may ask why.....well, the amount of vaccine we received for this first round was very small.  Don't despair, our supplier has notified us that we may be receiving another shipment of vaccine by the end of next week.  We cannot start to schedule yet since we do not know how much vaccine we're getting, nor when we will be getting it. Please check back with us or keep an eye on your Enron email as we will be sending out an announcement regarding the second round of flu shots.  

We appreciate your patience regarding this matter.


Thank you.

Regarding the waiting list that was announced through Enron in Action - we have not been instructed to keep a waiting list.  That seems to be an error.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Please check back with us or look for an email message regarding the next round of flu shots.

Mary,
Dean Drozdiak (ECC trader) was wondering about our review of the ISDA comments from Shell Canada Limited.  I told Randy Otto that I would check with you and let he and Dean know the status.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Hey Steph,
I hope you had a nice weekend.  We were at the grocery when you called and then we had plans to go to the movie later in the day, so I didn't have a chance to call you back.  We saw Amelie.  I loved it.  It makes me yearn for Paris.  I truly love that city.  So romantic.
 
Anyway, not much happening on this end.  Just getting ready for Thanksgiving.  We are doing the orphan thing and going over to our friend Virginia's to feast, drink and watch movies on her new Sony Dream System, alias Wet Dream System according to her.  It should be mellow and relaxing.  What are you doing for the holiday?  Are you getting together with family?
 
So, is Raymond fully recovering and eager to get back to work?  Or has he put on 50 lbs and become a recluse?  I hope he is doing well.
 
Gotta run, but let's do chat soon.
Give my love to the furry boys,
-l

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows:

I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.  Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.  Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.

Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.  Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Apparently CSFB neglected to ask us to complete the attached corporate resolution when we executed the broker agreement.  If we could fill out and forward on that would be great.

I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Legal friends - 

Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments.  One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the "title" of the Annexes.  Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number.   We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific.

This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex.  However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number.  Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. 

So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?  

Let me know if I'm missing part of a bigger picture or if you have questions.

Thanks,
Diane

Justin/Edmond,
We need to prepare an Enron Corp. Guaranty for Carr Futures.  I have been told that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr.  Can someone in your office verify this and let me know the date of the agreement?

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

I assume the parties are  ENA and ECTRIC with Carr Futures, Inc. I do not have any information about this though nor do I have a contact.  Sheila can you provide this information to Sara?

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Hi, Stephanie,

I wanted to check where we are on the ISDA ... we sent you a proposal at the
end of Sept, and you and I have exchanged a couple of emails since then, but
overall I believe that the ball is still ' in your court'.  Is this correct?

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Thanks.

Credit will need to address any other products to be included.  All we were told is that we need the guaranty for the ISDA and for EPMI.

Stephanie

If we are seeking to put in place a multi commodity guaranty, what has become of natural gas and emissions? I thought we were going to include these as well, any reason why these are not included in the guaranty? Are there any other commodities we would want covered under this guaranty?
	
I have made the change to reflect that I would hope that Exelon would in fact execute an EEI Master Agreement, the same change will need to be made to both documents	
I would prefer it if New York law governed these guarantees.

Please see attached mark-up.
	
Regards,
	
Marcus

You wanted to look at the guarantees being prepared for Exelon Generation and ENA/EPMI.

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Darren:
I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

Stephanie,
Have you had a chance to review the amendments?  Our traders are very eager
to trade with Enron NA (and are asking about it several times a day - I'm
sure you know how it goes!).  Please let me know if there is anything I can
do to help expedite the process.  Thanks a bunch.

Hey Steph!

I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it was
Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I
like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if that's
alright.

I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange
b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's thinking
but now saying - you know what I mean?

My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't recall
my cell right now.

We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and bitch
about the idiots we both work with!!!

Let me know what's up!

Jenn

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Kim,=20

I have reviewed the language your counsel sent and have discussed it with o=
ur General Counsel.  We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but=
 not the other two damage concepts.  We do not agree to the removal of "cos=
t of funding" since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transa=
ction requires a premium to be paid because of the off-market position.  Pr=
emiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component.  The remov=
al of the concept of "loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating, liq=
uidating, or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position" is al=
so a very real factor in calculating damages.  It may very well be that the=
 termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing=
 the transaction.  Furthermore, the you can obtain the same effect of termi=
nating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction (the equivalent o=
f a replacement transaction) rather than an outright termination with the h=
edge counterparty. Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of =
the coin, so to speak, it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss=
.  We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication, which=
 I think was one of your outside counsels concerns.  The definition of Loss=
 as was written is designed so that the Non-defaulting party can recover th=
e actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Party's failure to perform.  =
If the Defaulting Party objects to the Non-defaulting Party's calculation t=
hen such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and fina=
l determination by a New York court. =20

We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows:=20

Insert the following into Part 1(e), after the period at the end thereof. =
=20

"The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo=
llows:=20

"Loss" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran=
sactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equival=
ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co=
mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which =
case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection wi=
th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra=
nsactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the ele=
ction of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a res=
ult of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge =
or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to =
be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re=
placement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of =
funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidati=
ng, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Fu=
rthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees =
and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will dete=
rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is no=
t reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab=
ly practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference=
 to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers=
 in the relevant market."


 If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also wil=
ling to use the following definition, which was originally drafted by Goldm=
an Sachs, in lieu of the Loss definition.
 =20
"Replacement Value" , means, with respect to each Terminated Transaction or=
 group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, an amou=
nt that the party (the "Determining Party") or its agent determines in good=
 faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and c=
osts (or gains, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection=
 with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions.  A D=
etermining Party (or its agent) may determine Replacement Values for all Te=
rminated Transactions, any group of Terminated Transactions or individual T=
erminated Transactions, and may apply different valuation methods to differ=
ent Transactions or groups of Transactions.   A Determining Party (or its a=
gent) will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as =
of the Early Termination Date, or, if that would not be commercially reason=
able, as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates a=
fter the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under t=

The definition of Loss would be replaced throughout the ISDA by the definit=
ion of Replacement Value. =20

We hope that one of these definitions will work for you.  Please call if yo=
u have any questions or comments on the definitions.

James,
Can you confirm whether or not ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr Futures and what the date of such agreement is?  We need to provide Carr with an Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Thanks,

Please talk to James Canney as he works with Carr daily.  There should be an ECTRIC agreement but have never seen it so....

Sheila,
Do you know who in London works on futures/brokerage agreements?  I'm trying to find out if ECTRIC has an agreement with Carr.

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

I assume the parties are  ENA and ECTRIC with Carr Futures, Inc. I do not have any information about this though nor do I have a contact.  Sheila can you provide this information to Sara?

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Have you had a chance to review the amendments?  Our traders are very eager

Stephanie,
 
Please send forward your preliminary memo to me concerning PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.  If you sent one earlier, I never received it.
 
It is vital that we get these memos because it signals us to check EOL immediately as to whether or not we have to set up a shell agreement for a contract number so the counterparty can do on-line trading. 
 
Thanks,

We need to prepare an Enron Corp. Guaranty for Carr Futures.  I have been told that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr.  Can someone in your office verify this and let me know the date of the agreement?

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Frank -

I have one additional (and substantial) change that needs to be made to the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. guaranty.  We will be trading both financially and physically with this counterparty, so the guaranty needs to be written accordingly.  It appears that the guaranty as currently drafted is intended solely for financial trading.

Please call me with any questions.


Thanks,

Frank--

Just a couple of credit comments for the attached gty's:

For the e prime, inc. Gty:
Change the name of Excel Energy Inc. to Xcel Energy Inc. in the header
Under the first Whereas, add Enron Canada Corp. (fka Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.) ("ECC") as an additional Enron Entity being covered under this gty
Under the 4th Whereas clause, insert ECC as another Enron entity being covered for the physical transactions (confirmed under short term gas contracts)
On the 2nd page, 2nd paragraph--should we define what "Enron Parties" means???
Also, does it matter whether the counterparty's name is in all caps???  They represent it in small caps on all of their docs.

For the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. Gty:
Add Enron Canada Corp. as an additional Enron entity
Insert another Whereas clause (after the first Whereas clause) that specifies the physical gas transactions with ENA and ECC under certain contracts (none executed yet) or confirmations
Again, do the small caps really matter???

That should be all, unless Jay has some more to add.  Please let me know whether you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help on this!

Regards,

Veronica

Please find attached copies of two draft guarantees for the e prime group of companies.  The first guarantee is a very complex $30 million one that is based upon e prime Inc.'s relationship with the company as far as Stephanie Panus and I can tell from existing records.  Please review it very very (mucho very) carefully since you are much more familiar than we are with the physical side of this guaranty (especially the reference to "credit, loans or advances" that we simiply copied from the previous guaranty to the present one).  The second guaranty is a much simpler one in the amount of $10 million covering e prime Energy Marketing Inc.'s trading under thieir new ISDA. Based on my conversations with Jay, this is the guaranty structure desired by e prime.  Thanks

I was going to bed the other night when my wife told me that I had left the light on in the shed, she could see from the bedroom window. As I looked for myself, I saw that there were people in the shed taking things. 

I phoned the police, but they told me that no one was in his area to help at this time, but they would send someone over as soon as they be available. 

I said OK, hung up, and waited one minute, then phoned the police back. "Hello. I just called you a minute ago because there were people in my shed. Well, you don't have to worry about them now because I've shot them all." 

Within five minutes there were half a dozen police cars in the area, an Armed Response unit, the works. Of course, they caught the burglars red-handed. One of the officers said: "I thought you said that you'd shot them!" 

I replied with "I thought you said there was nobody available!"

Justin/Edmond,
We need to prepare an Enron Corp. Guaranty for Carr Futures.  I have been told that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr.  Can someone in your office verify this and let me know the date of the agreement?

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Subject:	RE: Confidentiality Agreement with Enron

Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of "Representative" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of "Representative" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.
[Panus, Stephanie]  
We can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Thanks and best regards,

Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution
copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via
email or at the number below.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Hi Stephanie, 

We should do but it pre-dates me and my colleagues (at least four years ago) so I don't have a copy and my job has moved departments a few times.
I have left a message with my contact at Carr in London to see if they have a version their side.
I settle our IPE futures account with Carr daily will this be affected by this guaranty business?

regards

James

Can you confirm whether or not ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr Futures and what the date of such agreement is?  We need to provide Carr with an Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Enclosed is a worksheet for Kerr-McGee Energy Services Corporation.  This worksheet reflects terms to be amended to the current ISDA with the customer.  The credit terms for Enron will remain exactly the same.  Please forward our drafted amendment to M.E. Booker at Kerr-McGee with a copy to me.  

Thanks,

Nidia has changed her mind there is no credit on this deal.  They will need a deemed ISDA though.  Can you follow up with Nidia to see who is drafting the confirm so we can send them the appropriate deemed ISDA.

Brent,

Please draft a language for the Credit provision section of USFC confirmation saying the following:

Vivendi Universal, S.A. needs to provide a $10 million parent gty. to ENA covering United States Filter Corporation for financial obligations.  This gty. needs to be received by Oct. 24, 2001.  Failure to provide this gty. will make United States Filter Corporation on default.

Attached is the gty. format.

Thanks for your help,

Stephanie

If we are seeking to put in place a multi commodity guaranty, what has become of natural gas and emissions? I thought we were going to include these as well, any reason why these are not included in the guaranty? Are there any other commodities we would want covered under this guaranty?
	
I have made the change to reflect that I would hope that Exelon would in fact execute an EEI Master Agreement, the same change will need to be made to both documents	
I would prefer it if New York law governed these guarantees.

Please see attached mark-up.
	
Regards,
	
Marcus

Sheila,
Do you know who in London works on futures/brokerage agreements?  I'm trying to find out if ECTRIC has an agreement with Carr.

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

I assume the parties are  ENA and ECTRIC with Carr Futures, Inc. I do not have any information about this though nor do I have a contact.  Sheila can you provide this information to Sara?

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Can you check on the below request?  I don't see that we have ever received the executed guaranty.  Tana made the request on 05/23/01.  Thanks.

Frank -

I have one additional (and substantial) change that needs to be made to the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. guaranty.  We will be trading both financially and physically with this counterparty, so the guaranty needs to be written accordingly.  It appears that the guaranty as currently drafted is intended solely for financial trading.

Please call me with any questions.


Thanks,

JRW

Frank--

Just a couple of credit comments for the attached gty's:

For the e prime, inc. Gty:
Change the name of Excel Energy Inc. to Xcel Energy Inc. in the header
Under the first Whereas, add Enron Canada Corp. (fka Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.) ("ECC") as an additional Enron Entity being covered under this gty
Under the 4th Whereas clause, insert ECC as another Enron entity being covered for the physical transactions (confirmed under short term gas contracts)
On the 2nd page, 2nd paragraph--should we define what "Enron Parties" means???
Also, does it matter whether the counterparty's name is in all caps???  They represent it in small caps on all of their docs.

For the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. Gty:
Add Enron Canada Corp. as an additional Enron entity
Insert another Whereas clause (after the first Whereas clause) that specifies the physical gas transactions with ENA and ECC under certain contracts (none executed yet) or confirmations
Again, do the small caps really matter???

That should be all, unless Jay has some more to add.  Please let me know whether you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help on this!

Regards,

Veronica

Please find attached copies of two draft guarantees for the e prime group of companies.  The first guarantee is a very complex $30 million one that is based upon e prime Inc.'s relationship with the company as far as Stephanie Panus and I can tell from existing records.  Please review it very very (mucho very) carefully since you are much more familiar than we are with the physical side of this guaranty (especially the reference to "credit, loans or advances" that we simiply copied from the previous guaranty to the present one).  The second guaranty is a much simpler one in the amount of $10 million covering e prime Energy Marketing Inc.'s trading under thieir new ISDA. Based on my conversations with Jay, this is the guaranty structure desired by e prime.  Thanks

Hello, 

Any GCP Adjustments will be highlighted in blue.  Also please note that Electrical District Number Eight has been confirmed with the Counterparty, so there will not be a CP ID until we confirm the information with the company.  I will send another spreadsheet with the CP ID as soon as the information is confirmed.  Please feel free to give me a call, if you have any questions.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Hi, Stephanie,

I wanted to check where we are on the ISDA ... we sent you a proposal at the
end of Sept, and you and I have exchanged a couple of emails since then, but
overall I believe that the ball is still ' in your court'.  Is this correct?

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Mr. Ross,

Attached for your review is a draft of the ISDA Master Agreement between
Enron North America Corp. and Quadra Energy Trading Ltd.  Please note
that the actual Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex are preprinted
forms from ISDA and cannot be sent electronically.  Therefore, I am also
sending you the entire package via overnight delivery.

If you have any questions, please call me at the below number or Brent
Hendry, Senior Counsel, at 713-853-7124.  We look forward to hearing
your comments.

Deal YJ7870.2 is already booked correctly;  the deal was done with BP Capital Equity Energy Fund, not the Internationl Holdings, L.P. entity.

Attached below is an Omnibus Confirm worksheet for BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.   Please prepare the appropriate annexes and forward to the financial confirmations group as soon as possible.

 << File: BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1 Omnibus Confirmation.xls >> 



Financial Confirms -

Upon receipt of the credit annexes from Legal, please send out confirms for the following trades:

YJ4705.1		YJ7870.1
YJ4707.1		YJ7870.2

Please note that these trades are currently booked to BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P.  This is, obviously, not the correct counterparty name.  Please correct and send confirmations at your earliest convenience.




Derek and George -
 
I have Global Counterparty setting up this new entity in our systems.  Please ensure that these trades get moved from BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P. to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  Margin calculations are dependent on these trades being booked correctly.  While Mike Larsen has been very accomodating, our margin team can not afford to spend time reconciling trades at the present.



Thanks to all for your help.

We need to prepare an Enron Corp. Guaranty for Carr Futures.  I have been told that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr.  Can someone in your office verify this and let me know the date of the agreement?

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Stephanie, Carr have come back to me and say they have some kind of contract with Enron Capital and Trade International but the person I spoke to needs managerial approval to send me a copy.
The manager is my normal contact so will hopefully be able to get a copy tomorrow...

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Stepanie -

Could you please prepare an NDA for Accenture LLP.  Tana has a draft document in her directory that has their address on it. 

The NDA is for CommodityLogic and should be the same form we used for Williams and Dynegy earlier this month.

Thanks.

Mark

That is fine.  You can disregard the MAC clause.  I guess I am just so used to putting it in for the EEI.

I do not think you need a MAC if you have a tiered Threshold.  Please confirm so that we can prepare the ISDA accordingly.  Thanks

Yes this deal is fine using the same credit terms as the old Petrotemex, SA de CV  transactions but now should read Grupo Petrotemex SA de CV.

Do we have enough "lead time" to get this out today?

Stephanie,

When you go into the document you need, just change the size to 100% instea=
d of 158%, and it should work fine.  I'm really trying to automate the proc=
ess so I don't have to make hard copies each month.  Can you try that now a=

Subject:	RE: Confidentiality Agreement with Enron

Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of "Representative" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of "Representative" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.
[Panus, Stephanie]  
We can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Thanks and best regards,

Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution
copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via
email or at the number below.

Hi Stephanie,

Someone in Tana's office told me you are the contact person for new NDA's.  If you are not the person, could you please contact me at 5-4079?  Here is the email I sent Tana.  Please call with any questions.

Hi Tana.

Could you please forward a NDA for the possible sale of EnronOnline functionality to the following person?  The NDA would be similar to the one you did for Equiva and Louis Dreyfus.

The contact information is:

Mr. Roger Parks
JR Simplot Company
rwparks@simplot.com

Thank you.

Mike Bridges

Stephanie,

This document reflects our changes.  Please contact me if there are any
problems with these.  We, too, would really like to get this completed
today.  Thanks!
(Also, we need a copy of the paper confirmation faxed to us as we cannot
confirm that a financial trade between CNR and ENA was done at all in
October, 2001 specifically:  "WE BOUGHT A 2500MMBTU/DAY SWAP ON 10/17/01
BEG 11/01 THRU 2/28/02")

The amendment (i) amends the definition of "Specified Swap" to include foreign exchange spot or foreign exchange forward transactions or currency option transactions; (ii) to specify that The Chase Manhattan Bank is a Multibranch Party and may act through any Office specified in a confirmation; and (ii) to add a "Scope of the Agreement" provision which states that if the parties enter into a "Specified Swap" (as defined in the master agreement) such "Specified Swap" shall be subject to, governed by and construed in accordance with the terms of the agreement unless the confirmation relating thereto specifically states to the contrary.

In addition, we have received an executed Amendment Agreement dated as of November 8, 2001 between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  The amendment replaces the definitions of "Settlement Amount" and "Loss" as set forth in the master agreement.

Copies will be distributed.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Hey Steph!

I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it was
Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I
like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if that's
alright.

I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange
b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's thinking
but now saying - you know what I mean?

My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't recall
my cell right now.

We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and bitch
about the idiots we both work with!!!

Let me know what's up!

Jenn

Hey, Jen,
What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to
have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of

   Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that
   once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
   implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ... I
   expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the

   details and a few other similar minor items.

   Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

In TAGG, the name appears as MidCoast Marketing.  But when we generate the confirm, it says Enbridge Marketing.  So with that in mind, should we hold off sending these confirms?

Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

Thanks,

Tom

I'm preparing the Copamex ISDA Master Agreement for execution.  Should I send the documents to you, or do you have a contact name and address I should send it to?

That sounds like fun.  We might be out of town for the weekend.  Raymond's friend has some land about halfway between Dallas and Houston.  We were thinking of going up Thurs night or Fri morning.  If we do go out of town, we need to get together next week(end). Give me a call.  We'll be around tonight.

Hey Steph!

I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to
travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it was
Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!

How long are Nancy & Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.

I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I
like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if that's
alright.

I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange
b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's thinking
but now saying - you know what I mean?

My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't recall
my cell right now.

We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and bitch
about the idiots we both work with!!!

Let me know what's up!

Jenn

Hey, Jen,
What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to
have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of
junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey & Michael are
going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office
these days.

Tom:

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Thanks.

Thanks for the certificates.  I have one more question.  What is the W-8BEN form for?  Do we normally complete and sign this on ISDA agreements?  I don't believe I've encountered one before.

The documentation they sent does not show that Sequent Energy Management, LLC became Sequent Energy Management, L.P.  The documents they sent show that 1) Sequent Energy Management, LLC changed its name to Sequent, LLC, 2) Sequent Energy, LP changed its name to Sequent Energy Management, LP, and 3) Sequent, LLC is the general partner of Sequent Energy Management, L.P.  I have left a message for the individual who sent the documents to us.

Hi Stephanie, 

I just wanted to be sure you received the documents I sent you on Sequent.  I was also wondering where we stand.  If you could let me know I would appreciate it.  

Thanks,

Mr. Ross,
I am checking with Nidia Mendoza and we will respond to you shortly.

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Mr. Ross,

Attached for your review is a draft of the ISDA Master Agreement between
Enron North America Corp. and Quadra Energy Trading Ltd.  Please note
that the actual Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex are preprinted
forms from ISDA and cannot be sent electronically.  Therefore, I am also
sending you the entire package via overnight delivery.

If you have any questions, please call me at the below number or Brent
Hendry, Senior Counsel, at 713-853-7124.  We look forward to hearing
your comments.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Tom:

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Apparently CSFB neglected to ask us to complete the attached corporate resolution when we executed the broker agreement.  If we could fill out and forward on that would be great.

Susan,

Could you please follow up with the above referenced counterparty to see where they are on our amendment to the existing ISDA?  This amendment provides for ENMAX Energy Marketing Inc. as a new contracting party under the agreement.  

Thanks for you help!

I am finalizing the documentation for Jeff's signature now.  The resolution (Jeff does not sign) will have to follow.

Please provide me with the contact information so that I can forward the documents to CSFB (phone, fax and courier delivery address).

Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

Thanks,

Tom

Please find attached the credit worksheet for G6 Energy Retailing, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Enersource Corporation.  Enersource Corporation will be the guarantor under this contract.  New guarantees need to be exchanged.  Please call with questions or comments.


 

Paul - Please be advised that the proposed terms are for discussion and negotiation purposes only as I am still waiting to here back from the counterparty on a few issued.

Veronica,
Attached is the Guaranty Amendment for Nicor Energy, L.L.C., which adds financial transactions to the existing guaranty.  Please copy Jim Hunt at Nicor (jhunt@nicor.com) on you message.  Once received from Nicor, the Amendment needs to be countersigned by ENA.  We will also need a copy for our files when fully executed.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Cheryl,
The scanned documents are too large to be printed on any of our printers up=
 here.  Therefore, can you please send me hard copies of the documents for =
Harbour Petroleum Company Limited and EP Exploration & Oil Inc.?

The IT dept has looked at our printers and nothing can be done to increase =
the memory so that I can print the scanned documents.  I am going to have t=
o request hard copies from you each month.

Mr. Wise,
Below are responses to your comments on the proposed Confidentiality Agreement.

Subject:	RE: Confidentiality Agreement with Enron

Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of "Representative" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of "Representative" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.
[Panus, Stephanie]  
We can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Thanks and best regards,

Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution
copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via
email or at the number below.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Mark,

We sent Chisholm an electronic copy of the LOI and received some comments.  

in paragraph 2, Chisholm would like to see something other than obligation, as we never state what is our 'current obligation.'  I guess the word 'obligation' raises an eyebrow.  We explained that the NDA and its conditions would still be in place.  Is there a way to tweak the language to more clearly state this and not use 'obligation'?

of course the non-solicitation clause was another point of clarification.  Currently, Chisholm is using students to develop an internal system and they have been working with other vendors.   Therefore, this clause will not work.  So we have discussed putting in a Notification clause in that Chisholm will notify us and keep us informed about the status of other vendors.  Perhaps something that would read "Chisholm agrees that it will notify Enron if and when it decides to enter into a formal agreement with any third party vendor etc."   


Give me a call if this doesn't make sense.  Thanks.   


Make It A Great Day!!
