Importance:	High

Hello, everyone!   

It has been determined that Stan will NOT be in the office on Monday, December 31; therefore, we will NOT have an ETS staff meeting that day.   Please notify any of your people who customarily attend and who I may have inadvertently left off the above distribution.   Stan did ask that his direct reports send him via e-mail a weekly update of key points for the week of December 23 and the week of December 30.

Stan wanted you to know that he will back in the office next Thursday, December 27, for meetings or conference calls and even on the 28th, if necessary.   So don't hesitate to call me should you need to schedule some time with Stan.   I will be here!

Keith,

=09If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new c=
ompressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service=
 within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existin=
g units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months =
after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken o=
ut of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we sh=
ould be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragr=
aph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in servi=
ce within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar=
 deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we=
 would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., c=
ontinue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and place=
d into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operat=
ing compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't=
 do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension fo=
r the abandonment.=20

t we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to th=

Hello, everyone!   

It has been determined that Stan will NOT be in the office on Monday, December 31; therefore, we will NOT have an ETS staff meeting that day.   Please notify any of your people who customarily attend and who I may have inadvertently left off the above distribution.   Stan did ask that his direct reports send him via e-mail a weekly update of key points for the week of December 23 and the week of December 30.

Stan wanted you to know that he will back in the office next Thursday, December 27, for meetings or conference calls and even on the 28th, if necessary.   So don't hesitate to call me should you need to schedule some time with Stan.   I will be here!

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Glenn, are you taking point on all these new Calif. proceedings?  Given Tony's commitment to other projects right now, I'd like you to, with support from Tony and Dan as needed, if Steve and Rob agree.  When Bill Rapp starts in our group Monday, we can start getting him up to speed as well. Thanks.  DF

Subject: Fw: PG&E's Gas Accord II application
Importance: High


Gentlemen,

Attached is PG&E's Gas Accord II application, filed as directed by the
Commission last month in D.01-09-016.  It is captioned as the, "Application
of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (U 39 G) Proposing a Market Structure
and Rules for the Northern California Natural Gas Industry for the Period
Beginning January 1, 2003."  The Commission Order required, "an application
proposing a market structure, rates, and terms and conditions of service
relating to the PG&E gas transmission and storage system for the period
beginning January 1, 2003, when most of the provisions of the existing 'Gas
Accord' are scheduled to expire."  There is no testimony attached.  Instead,
PG&E notes that, "the service of supporting testimony at the time an
application is filed is not required by the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure."  They say that testimony, if any, would be filed after a
prehearing conference is scheduled.  The utility suggests December 17 for
the conference.

In summary, PG&E requests Commission authorization to extend the existing,
approved Gas Accord market structure and rates for a two-year period.  Under
this proposal, those provisions of the Gas Accord currently scheduled to
expire as of January 1, 2003, will be extended through December 31, 2004,
while other provisions of Gas Accord scheduled to expire as of April 1, 2003
(consisting of certain storage-related provisions) will be extended through
March 31, 2005.  As noted by the utility, "This approach would not preclude
parties from proposing specific, justified operational or other limited
changes during the two-year extension period.  However, as discussed below,
parties seeking to obtain Commission approval of changes in the Gas Accord
regime, and thus to alter the status quo, must bear the brden of proof on
such issues."  If the simple, two-year extension of the Gas Accord is
adopted as requested, PG&E says it will waive the 2.5 percent escalation for
the two-year Gas Accord II extension period.

The application also notes that on September 20, 2001, shortly after
issuance of D.01-09-016,  PG&E filed a Plan of Reorganization with the
Bankruptcy Court, which, if adopted, would substantially restructure PG&E's
existing business operations.   As proposed, the Plan of Reorganization
would alter the regulation of PG&E's natural gas transmission and storage
system, as the utility's gas transmission and storage operations would be
transferred from PG&E to a new corporation, and operated under exclusive
FERC jurisdiction.   Assuming FERC accepted such jurisdiction, the CPUC
would no longer would have jurisdiction over the rates or terms and
conditions of service on the PG&E gas transmission and storage system.  Your
thoughts on this development would also be appreciated.

I assume we need to review this application to determine its potential
impact on Transwestern and that we should, of course, monitor the proceeding
generally to determine if any active role is required at a later date.  What
are the fundamental issues that concern Transwestern when considering PG&E?
How do you feel about FERC jurisdiction of its transmission/storage systems?

Finally, note that PG&E states that, "...contributing to uncertainty in the
gas markets is the large number of interstate pipeline construction projects
that have been proposed.  It will take at least a year or two before the
viability and impacts of those various pipeline projects can be confirmed in
the marketplace."  The utility also includes a footnote 9 that references
the Transwestern Red Rock FERC application (as well as seven other projects)
as pending at FERC.

Let's discuss at your convenience.

application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
northern California natural gas industry, beginning
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
application.

Michelle, 
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is
an informal agenda listing of topics:

1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  

2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks, 

Greg Hills

the link above talks about vertebroplasty - a cement injected to help fractured bones.  It may not be helpful to you as your's is disc related, not bone.  My neighbor had this procedure done by Dr. Twyford out of Baytown San Jacinto Methodist hospital.

This is late feedback, but wanted you to know that your presentation at the Directors Conference was well done. The expansion opportunities are exciting (and challenging), and I felt you used the opportunity well to thank and recognize some Operations folks who make the system work.

Attached are 250 and 300 MMcf/d cases to expand TW's mainline, Topock, and San Juan lateral.  These are + 30% costs but still based on the latest E&C estimate for Sun Devil.  If San Juan lateral is not expanded, then facility modifications and costs must be included for supplies to come from the east end which is not included in this study.

Keep in mind the cases including pipe loop used the smallest diameter pipe possible.  Therefore those cases can't be expanded above the 250/300 MMcf/d level easily.

If you have any questions, please call.

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Hi Pat. Yes, I would like to continue receiving the notices. Unfortunately, the next meeting conflicts with the annual Enron Management Conference (I don't recall why I could not make the last meeting but I believe I had another conflict). I found the meeting I went to very informative and therefore look forward to participating in future ones. Thanks.

	Steve
P.S. I would venture to guess that any option purchased in the last three years would out of the money. Maybe we can get together and commiserate one of these days!!!

Steve:  I know you got involved with the group as a speaker so let me know if you want to continue getting the meeting notices.  Since Enron is a member, you and anyone else in your group is always welcome to attend.  I'll be sure to pass on any good info I pick up as I still have some options that are now seriously out of the money.  Take care.  Pat

My other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows:

Section 35.2
	2nd paragraph, 3rd sentence.  Explanation of "incremental revenue".  When we talk about revenues which TW already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.  What if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet?  The language is so specific.  Can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what TW already has contractually committed?

	2nd paragraph, last sentence.  The phrase "guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate".  What does this mean?  TK & I were both a littles confused by this language.

	4th paragraph, 4th sentence.  The phrase "the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline".  TK, is the phrase "published indices" generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes?  I realize it will probably have to be something that is published.

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

Subject:	Indicated Shippers

I just received a voice mail from Kathy Edwards, attorney for Indicated Shippers.  She said her clients were not willing to "carve-out" the two issues of competitive bidding and scheduling rights for the Commission to decide as separate policy issues.  Indicated shippers said both issues have to be a part of a settlement.

Based on the input I have received from TW thus far, Indicated Shippers demands may make a settlement impossible.  We need to consider whether TW is willing to go further in regard to either or both of the Indicated Shippers positions (so far TW has said no).  Additionally thought should be given to whether appointment of a settlement judge at this time might be helpful.

I will try to get a call set up to discuss.  In the mean time, any feedback you have would be helpful.  Greg

After reviewing the Pre-hearing conference statement, I feel that at this juncture all that may be needed is for TW to enter an appearance. I don't believe that we currently have a position as to "whether PG&E's proposed resolution of the issues raised by parties in their protests is agreeable" such that we could file a statement as the judge has requested. Therfore, unless someone can summarize the parties positions and their impact on TW I would suggest that we use Jeff Dasovich to file an appearance for us since that would be the least costly alternative. If anyone has other suggestions please let me know.

Subject:	PG&E's Gas Accord II

The CPUC has issued a Notice of the Prehearing Conference for PG&E's Gas Accord II  filing to be held on January 7, 2002.  Prehearing conference statements are to be filed by January 2, 2002.  You may recall that the PG&E filing in October was a request to simply extend their current rates for two additional years for the period of Jan. 1, 2003 through Dec. 31, 2004.  They based their request on the unresolved bankruptcy reorganization plan and uncertain gas markets.  

Dan Douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on TW however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at FERC could certainly have an impact.  In that regard, Jeff Dasovich has scheduled a conference call on January 8th with PG&E to discuss their FERC filing and TW will be participating in that call.  

Given our initial reaction to this filing, to what extent do we want to particiapate in this proceeding and do we want to use Dan?  At minimum we had intended to have Dan file a prehearing statement for us.  However given our cash concerns, before calling Dan I wanted to make sure we were still on the same track.  Below is the link to the Prehearing Notice.  gh

Subject:	Enron Kids Update


This afternoon (Wednesday 12/19) we delivered all  468 gift bags to Gordon Elementary for their student Holiday Party on  12/20.  With your help, we raised over $2000 that we used to sponsor 33  of those children.  
 
Due to recent company events, the Enron  Kids Committee had a very difficult time getting sponsors for all the kids,  but no one was left out.  We used our remaining charity fund to make sure  EVERY child received their gift.  
 
Though we reduced the sponsor amount by eliminating  the shoes and jacket from the gift bags, we had enough money left over to  purchase gift certificates for shoes for the kids from a national chain  store.  
 
Though a lot of program sponsors we're without jobs  this holiday season, we only had to buy gifts for 23 kids (5% of the total) at  the last minute; this was significantly less than what I had dreaded  it might be.
 
Thank you for all your help and support.  468  Houston children have a better holiday because of you.
 
Best Wishes to You All,
Kevin Hyatt
Co-Chairman
Enron Kids Committee 2001

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Love you,

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Hi beautiful. I had a hard time yesterday because I missed you so much (in case you couldn't tell). The more we are together the more I love you and want to spend all my time with you. I can't wait to see you.

Love you sweetie.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 29, 2001
ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff "so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was "a tortuous process." 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While "both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof," the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting (see Daily GPI, Aug. 30). The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. "Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power." 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the "index-to-index" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate "to minimize any risk on transportation options." The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations (see Daily GPI, July 26).

Title: The West Enters a Bust 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2810;


***********************************************************************

RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS

The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000 
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's 
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to 
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the 
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure 
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the 
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power 
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.

*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in 
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving 
reliability.

*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter; 
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998. 

*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and 
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West 
Coast differentials.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

At the October 24, 2001, FERC Sunshine meeting, the following items were di=
scussed:

Kern River Firm Customers' Rehearing Request Denied (C-6, C-8 on agenda):

Called by Linda Breathitt, these are two Kern River expansion applications =
[CA. Action Project, CP01-69; 2002 Expansion, CP01-106] that have received =
certificates.  The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers w=
ho charge that additions will cause further  pro rata allocations at Wheele=
r Ridge.  The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh =
"any potential adverse impact to existing customers?" and that "the solutio=
n to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with in=
terstate pipelines, but with resolving the problems of take-away capacity o=
n SoCalGas?."  Hence, the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its o=
bligations to its customers, and the current lack of intrastate capacity "c=
annot be laid at [Kern River's] door."

Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the impor=
tant issue of FERC's response to intervener allegations of insufficient tak=
e-away capacity related to interstate expansions.  Though Breathitt doesn't=
 dissent from the rehearing denial, she wants to underscore the importance =
of the Commissions' acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation o=
f existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessi=
ty for pipeline expansions.  She also states that she is "uneasy" about FER=
C's "strident policies" in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite poss=
ible inefficiencies and constraints, and she reiterates that FERC's mandate=
 under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground.  She =
notes that the Commission will revisit the take-away capacity issue in anot=
her Kern River expansion application, CP01-422 [2003 Expansion Project].

Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Aus=
pice of "Electricity Market Design and Structure" NOPR, RM01-12 (E-5 on age=
nda)

Though  the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent, under this discu=
ssion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other th=
ree Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure t=
o coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions.  The need f=
or such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state co=
mmissioners during RTO Week.  To get this process going, Commissioner Brown=
ell asked staff to pursue a structure, perhaps a type of regional panel, wi=
th the mission to strengthen federal/sate relationships.  Considering the m=
agnitude of RTO development, FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff =
work on this.  Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp, Director of OMTR, =
bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement =
a structure.  While all three other Commissioners supported Brownell's prop=
osal, Commissioner Massey noted that there's already been seven years of "p=
rocess" and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be dev=
eloped "in a way that gets us to an endgame" concretely and clearly.

Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in=
 Seattle

Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material g=
athered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next month's Western Infra=
structure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November 2 [similar conferences=
 will be held regionally across the country].    The conference is a FERC "=
fact-finding mission" which will seek to answer three primary questions:
(1)=09=09Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate?
(2)=09What are the infrastructure needs for the region?
(3)=09What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy=
 infrastructure?

While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission, t=
he conference will cover all energy delivery systems.  The overriding quest=
ion on all fronts is what needs to be done, and who needs to do it.  The po=
werpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERC's websit=
e at <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/discussion_papers.htm=
>
=20
"RTO Week" Update=20

Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held a=
t FERC last week.  Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining "=
what Staff heard," which will be posted on FERC's website this week.  The d=
ocument is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders.  Sta=
ff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller, more focused St=
aff sessions to "dig deeper?."  According to Staff, while there seemed to b=
e some consensus at the 10.000 mile high level, more specific issues emerge=
d which may require further discussion.

Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations (Southeast, Northeast)=
, Midwest RTO Progress

In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases, Staff and the mediating=
 Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off,=
 what proposals and options are now on the table, and what next steps may b=
e necessary.  These mediation reports will be available online (by end of w=
eek).  What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs - =
there were no votes at the meeting, only discussion.

In the Midwest, both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations, and MISO and S=
PP are also prepared to merge.  While Commissioners discussed specifics of =
all the Midwest proposals, again no vote was taken or any indication given =
as to when a vote may occur.

ETS Draft Orders Issued:

?=09Northern Natural, RP00-223-005:  Northern's Limited Firm Transportation=
 ["LFT"] tariff sheets were approved, including two additional LFT sheets c=
oncerning the Carlton surcharge.
?=09Calypso, CP01-444-000:  Letters issued to Secretary of State, Secretary=
 of Defense requesting review of draft Presidential Permit for Calypso to c=
onstruct, own and operate pipeline facilities at the boundary of the U.S. E=
xclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] and the Bahamas EEZ.

I just received a voice mail from Kathy Edwards, attorney for Indicated Shippers.  She said her clients were not willing to "carve-out" the two issues of competitive bidding and scheduling rights for the Commission to decide as separate policy issues.  Indicated shippers said both issues have to be a part of a settlement.

Based on the input I have received from TW thus far, Indicated Shippers demands may make a settlement impossible.  We need to consider whether TW is willing to go further in regard to either or both of the Indicated Shippers positions (so far TW has said no).  Additionally thought should be given to whether appointment of a settlement judge at this time might be helpful.

I will try to get a call set up to discuss.  In the mean time, any feedback you have would be helpful.  Greg

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject: BR/TW Window Rock Meeting Scheduled for Dec 3rd


Michelle, 
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is
an informal agenda listing of topics:

1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  

2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks,

      Since our negotiated rates came out so well, is that an indication that the SoCal dispute is probably a slam dunk as well??

Of course you would! We offer the Most Potent Oral GH Formula available to help you achieve all of this and more! Turn Back The Clock and Turn Up the Energy Now! 
In thousands of clinical studies, GH has been shown to accomplish the following: 
 _ Reduce body fat and build lean muscle without exercise! 
_ Enhance sexual performance 
_ Remove wrinkles and cellulite 
_ Lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol profile 
_ Improve sleep, vision and memory 
_ Restore hair color and growth 
_ Strengthen the immune system 
_ Increase energy and cardiac output 
_ Turn back your body's biological time clock 10-20 years in 6 months of usage !!!  
 Here is a sample of just a few of the letters we receive every week 
thanking us for what our product has done:    
  "I am astounded! The day before I started taking the GH1, 
I took blood tests. Then I began using the GH1 as directed. 
After 8 weeks I took blood tests again. 
My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! 
Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! 
I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. 
To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. 
My "biological" age is now that of a 40 year old!" 
-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY 
"A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood 
pressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. 
After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- 
and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!" 
-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA 
"After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher 
level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision 
were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and 
it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill 
at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and 
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, 
I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra 
karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!" "After 6 months on 
GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has 
increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!" 
-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA 
"As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute 
and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where 
I could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again 
after only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!" 
-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA 
"When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print." 
-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA 
"I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. 
I have been under great stress in my business. 
I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping 
my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst 
of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. 
Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. 
My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy 
when I go out walking." 
- Carolyn Munn 
"I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that 
I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed 
a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging 
Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. 
Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!" 
-Rita Mills McCoy 
"I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, 
in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels 
dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging 
Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal 
coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this 
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking 
few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! 
-Alan Ross, 43 years old 
GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 
available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH. 
  WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?   
Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which 
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the 
endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically 
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few 
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones 
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout 
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. 
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. 
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously 
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original 
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to 
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability 
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. 
Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. 
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the 
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance 
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the 
proper dosage amounts. 
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, 
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny 
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate 
the activities of the vital organs. The word "hormone" is derived from a Greek word 
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the 
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other 
hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly 
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including 
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also 
helps restore hair color and hair loss. 
  
THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?   
Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production 
gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per 
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, 
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians 
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. 
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical 
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been 
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only 
effective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by 
Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. 
  
  GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61 
Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. 
The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. 
This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age 
of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, 
200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages 
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, 
or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called 
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. 
Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. 
Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include 
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen. 
After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined 
after 6 or more months of GH therapy: 
 _ Improved memory 
_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs 
_ Increased sexual drive and performance 
_ Increased fertility 
_ Enhanced immune system 
_ Quicker wound and fracture healing 
_ New hair growth and color reparation 
_ Sharper vision 
_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance 
_ Increased muscle mass without exercise 
_ Reduction of cellulite and fat 
_ Increased stamina and vitality 
_ Reduction in high blood pressure 
_ Improvement in sleep 
_ Anti-aging 
_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing 
_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol 
_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol 
_ Strengthening of bones 
  
 IS GH SAFE?    
GH has been successfully used in the medical community 
for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. 
Edmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over 
800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that 
GH had substantial benefits and no side effects.

Subject: Hello From Canada


Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.
Laura Watton

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG"- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Subject:	New Mexico Power Plant Project

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Subject:	FW: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market
boosted distillate demand.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Rod:

As per our phone conversation, the list of information we would like to
have follows:

1.  FERC Form 2s for the last three years
2.  Revenue breakdown:
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs
   for each type of transportation contract
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the
projected years
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward
6.  Employee benefit plan information - funding status, return rates,
future liabilities

Thanks Rod.

When you have a time in mind for a call to discuss the above list please

Below is a link to the Proposed Decision by  Com. Bilas on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding that has been lingering on the agenda for most of the year.  This was just issued late last week and published today.  I'm still in the process of reviewing it but the good news is that he is proposing the adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement which Transwestern helped design and supported along with most other participants.  The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions.  Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please review and advise if you agree we should file comments (I also have a call into Mark Baldwin).  Note this is 140+ pages--you may wish to review the summary and pertinent sections.

Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.
Laura Watton

Imagine how wonderful it would feel to help a large number of children in your area and making $4,000 to $12,000 per month doing it?                   {s13

Helping needy children and parents AND at the same time supporting your own family very well financially.

Every day in your community there are single parents struggling to make ends meet and wondering where the money will come from to cover their children's basic expenses.

Most of these parents are hard working people who just need help from the person who has a legal responsibility to give it to them.

Every day a large number of parents call us for help in collecting their child support.  Many more than we can possibly handle.  We need the help of caring and dedicated people who would like to enter a new high paying prestigious profession.

The court has decided how much these parents are to receive but the caseloads are so large that the results are that there is over $32 Billion dollars worth of uncollected Child Support in the US today and this amount grows by millions every week.

If you would be interested in helping us, then we have all of the training that you will need to start a new business in this high growth profession of "Child Support Processing!"

We have the resources available to you to help you track down deadbeat parents and force them to pay what they legally owe, without ever having to come into contact with them!

We have the most extensive Computer Data Bases in the world for the processing of Child Support.  Our databases allow you to track down dead beats, find their assets and then collect the child support, which is due.  These powerful databases will be available to you if you choose to join us.

You can do what private investigators do, legally, and for a fraction of what it would normally cost! And you can do it from the comfort of your own home office!

More details about our Child Support Collection Course:

Child Support Collection has reached epidemic proportions, $32 billion nationally; state agencies are simply too understaffed!  State agencies are typically very happy when we assist a parent.  We find the dead beat and their assets and the state agencies are pleased to use their government powers, working with us, to collect the back child support.

Our Child Support Collection course teaches you to how locate the DEAD-BEAT parent, their assets, employment, bank accounts and how to collect on those assets.

The manual supplies the forms, brochures, and child support business methodology.

We also have the most powerful reporting capabilities at your disposal to help you track down dead-beat parents.

Unpaid child support is an epidemic . . . and you can be the cure!

As our national and local media remind us every day, millions of custodial parents are struggling to raise their families without the child support to which they are entitled. In fact, you or someone you know is probably tackling this problem right now.

This Child Support Collection Course teaches you to recover your own child support payments. Or you can learn to help others in need, earning about 25% to 30% of what is collected.  That translates to $4,000 . . . $8,000 . . .even $12,000 earned each month collecting for others! You'd be hard-pressed to come up with any other legal business opportunity that allows you to earn such a significant income while performing such a valuable community service.

Not only do you have the potential to make thousands of dollars a month recovering delinquent child support payments, you'll also "earn" the gratitude of custodial parents and their children who are finally receiving the money they're due!

You might be thinking a successful child support recovery business would require a difficult time commitment or a lot of expensive equipment. Not at all! You can make thousands of dollars each month, part-time or full-time, working from your home, with only a telephone and a home computer!

This course places you at the leading edge of a major national trend, namely, privatizing the recovery of delinquent child support payments. Whereas the government succeeds only one fifth of the time in this area, well-trained private parties are doing four times better!

And remember every time you recover a payment, you can earn 25% to 30% of what you find!

We provide step by step instructions for you to follow, enabling you to collect all back-owed child support for yourself or anyone else you choose. It is not necessary to have in-depth legal knowledge or even a college education.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, absent parents in the United States have a big bill to pay: $32 billion in delinquent child support payments. That is over 15 million cases, with 1.5 million new cases added every year. More than half of court-ordered child support cases become delinquent at some time, and in more than one fourth of cases, no payments are ever made.

Children deserve and need the support they have been awarded, but government agencies aren't offering any real help because they are totally over whelmed.. In fact, the agencies are so flooded with requests that they only collect about 18% of the child support money they go after. In other words, the government typically has an 82% failure rate! No private business could survive with that kind of record, and the impact on children can be devastating.

Statistics show that after a divorce, an absent parent's available income goes up 43%, while the custodial parent's spending money goes down 20%.

With your help, children in need have a four-times-greater chance of receiving the money they are due than if they relied on the government for recovery.

One mother has told us that working with the government to find an absent parent "is like beating your head against a brick wall. The frustration and futility you feel are enormous. Agencies crawl at a snails pace, and authorities often lose files or seem to make no progress with a case." But this same mother's outlook changed after reviewing our course: "I would have given anything to have this knowledge years ago. This is the best $149.00 I have ever spent."

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

***********************************************************************

Dear Mexico Gas and Power Client,

As you might be aware, Pemex is proposing a new type of service contract as a
way to increase E&P investment in nonassociated gas in the Burgos basin.
Originally, CERA was planning to have a luncheon in December to discuss the
current status of these integrated contracts. Our intention was to invite key
individuals from Pemex to discuss the proposed contracts with our clients.
Pemex has informed us, however, that they are unable to discuss the service
contracts with the private sector prior to their formal announcement of the
service contract structure. Until this constraint has been resolved, CERA has
decided to have a conference call detailed below. We look forward to your
participation.

Regards,

Mexico Gas and Power

**************************************************************************

TOPICS

*  Overview of proposed service contract structure

*  Assessing the attractiveness of the contracts

*  Expectations of future investment under proposed structure

Throughout this holiday season we have been reminded by press and media of
the changes to our lives' normality because of the events these last few
months.  When we travel we observe uniformed soldiers and added security
that tell us our way of living and business conduct has forever changed.

The messages of this holiday season, Hope, Peace, Love and Joy have
significant meaning.  All our hearts desire these feelings to endure.
Perhaps like never before we should commit to be instruments that bring
Hope, Peace, Love and Joy to our country and to our world.  Our faith in
those principles and ideas that have carried us and made us great has been
renewed.  Our resolve to make a difference in every endeavor has been
strengthened.  We know we will get better after being in the valley of
adversity and trial.

Tom James Company and all our employees across the United States, the United
Kingdom, Japan and Holland join me in thanking you for your business in
2001.  We have been tested and we are strengthened.  Our partners, who call
on you, are better equipped entering 2002 than ever before to serve you.  We
have significantly added quality products in all our price points and
expanded our casual wear.  The addition in 2001 of the finest footwear made
in the world has given us the highest quality footwear product available.

Our partners in our 11 factories have been touched by the events of
September 11th and after.  Most of our manufacturing facilities are in the
Northeast part of the United States.  Tom James, like so many others,
experienced loss.  So, going forward forever in our memories will be the
faces and pictures of 2001.

Our commitment to you is to be better and our obligation to life is to give
back to life with what we are and who we become.  Your patronage is very
important to Tom James.  Please let us know when we do not perform to your
expectation.  Our guarantee is 100% satisfaction.  We live by our creed.

Thank you for helping us enjoy a fine year.  We will pursue excellence in
serving you, our valued client.  Best wishes for your continued health,
happiness and prosperity in the New Year.

Happy Holidays!
Respect and Regards
Robert F. Sherrer
Chairman and President, Tom James Company

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

Rod: 

As per our phone conversation, the list of information we would like to 
have follows: 

1.  FERC Form 2s for the last three years 
2.  Revenue breakdown: 
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period 
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs 
   for each type of transportation contract 
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal 
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the 
projected years 
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world 
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward 
6.  Employee benefit plan information - funding status, return rates, 
future liabilities 

Thanks Rod. 

When you have a time in mind for a call to discuss the above list please 
contact:

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

***********************************************************************

STRATEGIC CHALLENGES GROW IN ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA

The issues that are most prominent in the environmental arena are notable for
their relatively long time horizons. Thus, although the uncertainty created by
recent events might cause adjustments in environmental strategies it is less
likely to result in fundamental shifts in direction. In the immediate future,
however, the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while
maintaining long-term objectives.

* Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations,
while the US focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear.

* The European Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme, while individual European nations are developing or
implementing their own (potentially incompatible) systems.

* Continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security
concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche, bringing
increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles.

Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

It has come to my attention that the Richardson PNR rate was less than previously reported....It also gave me an opportunity to corrected a mathematical error in my original e-mail.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

I received a call from Portland General Electric (PGE) asking for assistance in posting an open season for them in regards to their Kelso-Beaver Pipeline.  The reason they are asking for assistance is that they currently do not have an electronic bulletin board.  I have attached a draft version of their open season.  The plan would be to utilize the Hot Tap platform for their posting.
 
Please advise if you have any comments regarding this issue.
 
Thank you.

How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

  Thank  you  for  your  interest!!!                          
Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in  "How to Collect Money Judgments"   .            '  s6  
If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and  why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income   .
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: "Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime."
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between  200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money
Judgment debt   . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more
Judgments take its place.
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.
With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.
The income potential is substantial in this profession.  We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year  . Some choose to operate out of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.
Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
  92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time   .
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
Quote's from several of our students:
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: "I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course.  My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars   . Your
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
judgments he is working on.
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: "  I am now making $2,000.00 per
week  and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now."
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
"  I am now making $12,000.00   per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out"
Marshal in area code 407 states to us "I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"
>From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:
With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you

I think we ought to discuss the Order with Columbia Gulf.  Its possible we =
are ok.  The problem FERC seems to have is that under the negotiated contra=
ct it is impossible for anyone but Columbia and the Shipper to know what th=
e rate is at the time of the transaction.  Columbia's deal contains a defau=
lt rate (based on index differentials) applicable if the parties are unable=
 to agree on a basis price used to determine the "Negotiated Daily Reservat=
ion Charge".   To avoid the application of the default rate, the "Negotiate=
d Daily Reservation Charge" requires Columbia and the shipper to negotiate,=
 and agree,  to a basis number on a daily basis.  The parties did not speci=
fy particular index's for the purpose of calculating basis.  Thus, under Co=
lumbia's deal only the default rate can be determined at the time of the tr=
ansaction.  In contrast, Transwestern's deals appear to be similar to Colum=
bia's default rate; i.e., a rate based upon index's where the index's are a=
greed upon and stated upfront.  Thanks.  Greg  =20

Subject:=09Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rat=
e transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the=
 negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff =
within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual r=
ate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think abou=
t this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG"- Reliant deals.    Notwithst=
anding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day =
if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an ord=
er is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to elimin=
ate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as =
well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could ne=
ed to issue an order.  =20

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehea=

you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate,=
 so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm=

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

Hello Steve -

Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update - I
moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and
have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline Optimization
projects.

I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture has a
strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered
Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology for
making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.  This
is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from RCM
(say $20MM) as part of our "guarantee"
4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over the
next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around the
Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss
further.

Hope all is well.

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.

Hey Steve- Since the 6th looks like it is a good day to get together, maybe I could come over to your house around 12:00.   We could go to lunch, and since I had the the last priviledge of  picking out a "very interesting movie", I would like you to to pick out the next one! This time I also have a lot more time flexibility in the afternoon.
     Of course, I will drop you a quick line prior to the 6th to make sure your schedule is still on target.  Otherwise, enjoy Thanksgiving with your family (don't get too fat!).  Talk with you later.  Christine

I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested
in the type of service we offer.

Some things to consider:

We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
interest as well.

Some memory joggers:

Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
Who do you know that likes nice cars?
Who do you know that owns their own company?
Who do you know that is successful in sales?
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

Thanks for your help!

Title: Hidden Risks: Microbasis in the Short-term Gas Markets
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2826;


***********************************************************************

STRUCTURAL RISK AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY GROW IN INFLUENCE IN REGIONAL GAS
MARKETS.

The dramatic increase of participants in the daily market for natural gas over
the past several years has brought with it the demand for pricing indices that
are increasingly regional and selective in nature. These published indices
provide a valuable service to the market, but the high level of confidence that
the general trading community has bestowed upon them may be misplaced.

*  Current economic conditions are masking hidden volatility potential,
especially at local index points that have unrealized demand potential.

*  Large, volatile demand in the form of new gas-fired generation utilizes the
existing pipeline system in ways that were never envisioned in the original
system design.

*  Control of pipeline infrastructure has moved from the relatively benign
local distribution companies to economically driven traders and asset managers.

*  As demand grows, physical flexibility in the system and the number of buyers
and sellers decrease on the margin.

There are files that back up the revenue projections that Steve Kleb gave me hard copies of for 2001 and 2002.  Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections.   

2002 File looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\Tw\twfin\2001\misc\[plan_forecast_design.xls]\summary.  

2001 file looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\tw\twfin\2001\forecast-CE\[ce 3-2001.xls]model _source_data.    

If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well.  I would like as soon as possible and you can email to the cc addresses as well.

I would like to recommend a Personal Achievement Award for Audrey Robertson in the amount of $1000. Audrey has done a tremendous job the last several months in helping support several other groups in addition to her normal job duties. She has put forth a significant effort in performing administrative duties for the ETS Business Development and Facility Planning departments. Audrey has gone out of her way to provide daily assistance to these groups and I have received several notes indicating her exemplary performance. In addition, she helped coordinate the move for several groups to our new floors as well as plan a major customer meeting which had to be cancelled but was done in a manner resulting in no financial cost to Transwestern (saving us thousands of dollars).   

If you are in agreement with this recommendation please forward this note to Brian Schaffer in HR with your approval. Thanks.

	Steve

Mr. Steve Harris
Regional Vice President
Transwestern Pipeline Company

Dear Mr. Harris:

Recently, there has been a lot of discussion and confusion on the
direction of the distributed energy (DE) industry. With the summer stock
price collapse and slow market development, many DE stakeholders are
re-thinking their strategies. Cambridge Energy Research Associates

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.  
 
Bill

Title: The Spanish Gas Auction: A Precedent for Europe?
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2811;


***********************************************************************

A SMALL STEP FOR SPAIN, BUT AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR EUROPE

The recent auction of contract gas in Spain represents an early initiative both
to release gas from preexisting long-term contracts and to make it available to
aspiring market entrants. As such, CERA believes it could provide a precedent
for other European markets (and for their regulators) where release gas
programs have not so far been on the public agenda.

*  The Spanish gas release program, as currently devised, will have limited
impact on domestic competition. However, pressure will grow in Spain to extend
the program.

*  By setting a unique precedent across Continental Europe, Spain has signaled
a possible path for the reforms needed on the supply-side to complete the
European gas internal market.

*  The role of credit risk and sovereign guarantees will be critical in any
reallocation or renegotiation of long-term contracts.

Title: Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2808;


***********************************************************************

FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINE

The economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling
gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices
briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068
gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by
November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers' drilling plans for the
2002 budget year are already being curtailed.

*  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the
United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day
of lost production.

*  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop
in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive
capacity.

*  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy
recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.

It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several "packages" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).  If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it.  Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it?  

If we are going to be in a dogfight with BP on these deals, lets make sure we go in armed with as much of the relevant information as possible to demonstrate we were following the rules.  DF

I have some errands I need to run at lunch.  I can pick my things up then.  About Las Vegas,  I never received a confirm on Danny Gains last week.  I am not sure what happened, however, I called the Mirage directly and he is sold out that weekend.  Anything else you would like to see?  What about for dinner, any place special you would like to go?

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter.

Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

Steve,
You will also find this of interest.  Evidently, the old material (possible PCB tainted) is moving into pipeline areas on SoCal's system previously undiscovered.  This is apparent since we are dry and non-detect for PCB's now at Needles.  The cost and attention to these matters will continue for TW.  John Shafer

Subject:	FYI, PCB mtg with SoCal

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below:

SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas.    

SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.

Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on to Transwestern at 86%.

Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 

I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated. 

We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks.

Bill,

Attached is worksheet that provides some comparables of the USGT volumes that flowed west.  In the scheme of things, the volumes in question our not that significant.

Look at the "comparables" page of the excel file.  This missing section should be given to you by Dennis Lee on Monday.

I'm out next week but I should be available by cell phone or my home phone (713)665-4026.

Summary Risk Data as of 10/26/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	52	
Active Physical Deals	35	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	78.0	
VaR ($thousands)	450.8	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		


Physical deals modelled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged phsycal positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance metholodogy, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


NOTE: We are reviewing the modelling of one of the financial deals which may have a significant impact on the numbers reported above.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the "wild card" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

Shouldn't we talk to them about sourcing off TW instead of waiting to see who the supplier will be? I would like to be as proactive as possible on this one. Thanks.

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Summary Risk Data as of 11/16/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	83	
Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	345.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	159.4 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		


Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions.

Who in legal have you been working with?  Tracy was wondering when we thought we would receive the money.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps 
Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. 
In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would "no longer make available to the public" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. 
Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to "respond timely to legitimate requests" for such documents. 
The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Given the anthrax scares on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, a spokeswoman said the Commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages.

That sounds great. I would like to spend as much time with you as possible so come as early as you can and stay as late as you want. 

I actually thought the movie was pretty good. We'll see what we can come up with the next time. 

I'll try not to eat too much this week ( I have to look good for you!).

Take care.

Hey Steve- Since the 6th looks like it is a good day to get together, maybe I could come over to your house around 12:00.   We could go to lunch, and since I had the the last priviledge of  picking out a "very interesting movie", I would like you to to pick out the next one! This time I also have a lot more time flexibility in the afternoon.
     Of course, I will drop you a quick line prior to the 6th to make sure your schedule is still on target.  Otherwise, enjoy Thanksgiving with your family (don't get too fat!).  Talk with you later.  Christine

Jorge,

For tomorrow's meeting about the rate and term of the gas to potentially flow on the proposed Trans Pecos Pipeline, we would like to discuss the following rate scenario based on our Level A engineering assessments:



			Volume				Rate			Years

		240,000MMbtu/d			$.25/MMBTU		1 through 15

		26,000MMbtu/d	additional volume	$.25/MMBTU		3 through 15

		40,000MMbtu/d	additional volume	$.25/MMBTU		4 through 15
		
		306,000 MMbtu/d total contracted by year 4
		

Any changes to the volumes or timing of additional gas will effect the rate.

Steve, 

While I am checking on this items we discussed, here is a draft copy of both proposals.  Please note that I have given them 60 days to respond.  That may be too long for the Red Rock proposal.  Let me know if you would like one or both timeframes changed.  I'll visit with you by voice mail as I get an answer from Dennis Tu.

Thanks, Kim.

I've forwarded this to Joe, Rob,a nd MKM as there are some regulatory issues to be considered.  I thought all FERC-regulated electric utilities had to have "OASIS" electronic bulletin boards.  Doesn't PGE have one of those, and if so, can't they post the notice themselves?  Interesting.  DF

Subject: Open Season for expansion of the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (the "KB Pipeline")


I received a call from Portland General Electric (PGE) asking for assistance in posting an open season for them in regards to their Kelso-Beaver Pipeline.  The reason they are asking for assistance is that they currently do not have an electronic bulletin board.  I have attached a draft version of their open season.  The plan would be to utilize the Hot Tap platform for their posting.
 
Please advise if you have any comments regarding this issue.
 
Thank you.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Subject:	RE: answer to cpuc protest

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

Frustrated With Your Internet Marketing Efforts?
Have you tried:

FREE Classifieds? (Don't work)

Web Site? (Good for closing but you have to have visitors)

Banners? (Expensive and Iffy)

E-Zine? (They're great, but only with thousands of members)

Search Engines (Easy to be buried with thousands of others)



E -MAIL MARKETING IS THE ANSWER!

It is a proven fact that your best chance of attracting
new business is through Direct E-mail.

It's a numbers game. The more people receiving your ad,
the better your chances of attracting a substantial
interest in your product or services.

The profits that E-mail advertising generate are amazing.
We are living proof. We are a direct E-mail internet
advertising company and our clients pay us thousands
of dollars a week to E-mail advertise their products
and services.  We utilize a database of over 100 million
internet addresses that are constantly updated and
checked for deliverability before we mail them.

The secret to an effective bulk E-mail marketing campaign
on the internet is directly related to the freshness of
the lists used.  To ensure that our customers receive the
freshest mailing addresses, we are constantly updating
and revising our mailing lists.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Hello Corporate HANDS Parents-
Thank you for taking the time to nominate your child's program.  We are in the process of sending the centers paperwork to fill out and return to us. You might want to verify this with your director.  The information they send back will be reviewed for their needs and the number of Corporate HANDS families they serve.  The Corporate HANDS company representatives will get the reports in December and in January we will notify the centers of the results.

Subject:	USGT Negotiated Rate Filing/ Response to CPUC Protest

Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 

I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated. 

We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks.

Summary Risk Data as of 11/21/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	83	
Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	41.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	166.5 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		



Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

Terry Kowalke

I'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have Shipper imbalances.  Here are my comments.

Attached is a draft of the letter that we propose to send to the CPUC regarding the AL2837 proceeding in which SoCal Gas is proposing changes to its "windowing" criteria. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. We need to file this tomorrow, so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today, if possible. Thanks.

I finally felt it.
I was always wondering what they were all talking about until, This morning...
I did my weekly weigh-in and when I saw that smaller number swing around that scale,
I didn?FFFF92t know whether to faint, scream, or cry.
So I danced.
Just imagine, a large woman with crazy hair, laughing and dancing naked in her living room with her scale.
I gave that scale a big sloppy-wet kiss!!...
I lost 8 pounds in one week!
I have lost a total of 53 pounds in exactly 3 months.
I KNOW what made the difference this last 3 months?FFFF85
My hubby and I bought a product that was recommended by an affiliate.
Not just any ole product, A MIRACLE, Called BerryTrim Plus!
I use it 2 times a day and it lit a fire under my Wimpy old metabolism.
I have tried and failed with over 80 different diet programs. I swore, that I would never try another diet product again.
So many times I thought I was going to give up, and give in to the fact that I?FFFF92ll never be thin and attractive.
I am SOOOOOOO glad I didn't. WOE, this really works and its sooo Damn easy.
(Click below to Check this out for yourself, there's lots of people just like me.)
Don't give up.

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.  
 
Bill

Title: The West Enters a Bust
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2810;


***********************************************************************

RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS

The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.

*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving
reliability.

*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter;
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998.

*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West
Coast differentials.

Subject:	Southern Trails Cancels Calif Part of Pipeline Conversion

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift Toward Winter
URL(s):

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2748;


***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu.
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues
around LNG shipments.

Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.
Laura Watton

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

***********************************************************************

ABUNDANT CONTINENTAL GAS SUPPLIES SET TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE UK FORWARD CURVE

The UK forward curve may come under pressure in first quarter 2002 as abundant
supplies of Continental gas become available for import into the United
Kingdom. CERA identifies four key pressures on the Continent that could make
surplus gas available at low cost:

*  Contract prices are on the slide.

*  Contract volumes are running ahead of demand.

*  Storage levels are high.

*  LNG cargoes are returning.

Title: Quarterly Refined Products Watch: After the Shock--Uncertain Prospects for Recovery
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2820;


***********************************************************************

SHARPLY WEAKER DEMAND AND GROWING STOCKS TO DAMPEN REFINING MARGINS

Spot refining margins are likely to experience sustained weakness for the
balance of 2001 and into 2002, under the influence of

*  weakening refined product demand resulting from the global economic
slowdown, significant cutbacks in airline flight schedules, and the outlook for
much lower North American natural gas prices this winter

*  the likelihood of growing crude oil and product stocks as OPEC confronts the
growing challenging of continuing to manage the market in the face of rapidly
slowing demand and growing non-OPEC productive capacity

The only significant upside risk to margins in the near term lies in events--
possibly linked to new terrorist attacks or the ongoing military campaign--that
could disrupt the oil supply chain.

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

Drew and Steve,
      Since our negotiated rates came out so well, is that an indication that the SoCal dispute is probably a slam dunk as well??

This is to advise you that Stan is required to attend an Enron off-site meeting the afternoon of October 24; therefore, we will need to reschedule our half day staff meeting.      Please be aware that it may be rescheduled on short notice and you may need to clear your calendar to accommodate, and I apologize to you in advance for that inconvenience!

I will be in communication.

Let me know if you have any questions.

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Title: Energy Liberalization in Europe--A New Concern for Security of Supply

***********************************************************************

SECURITY OF ENERGY SUPPLY BACK ON THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL AGENDA

The tragic events of September 11 brought a new dimension to the general
question of security--clearly energy facilities could be targets for terrorist
attacks. Even before the attacks, high world oil prices and the euro's
depreciation put energy security of supply back on the European political
agenda, together with the awareness of dependence on imports, and the risk of
economic and even physical disruption in energy supply, including natural
disruptions from storms or flooding.

*  Security of supply, under its different forms, has returned as a political
concern across the European Union.

*  The new liberalized environment should, at least partly, mitigate security
supply risks.

*  Long-term risks remain a matter of discussion, with concern that market
mechanisms provide the right signals, such as adequate investment made at the
right time.

Bill, attached are a few comments/questions on your proposed draft answer, which I thought was excellent.  We might want to discuss some of these questions with the ccs.  Thanks, Maria

Do you still have the bike for sale? I am very interested and would like to see a picture of it if you have one. Do you know if it could be shipped to Texas relatively inexpensively? Also, do you have the title? Thanks.

Hi Cindy. Just thought I would drop a quick note to see how things are going. Thanks for the cards you sent the kids and I. Jeanie came down on Saturday but went back Sunday to Dallas. Maybe if you all get a chance you can come down during Christmas or New Years. I think Jim and his kids may be here also. Hope all is going well and we look forward to seeing you soon. Take care.
	Love,
		Steve

Steve,

FYI, Kirk did not have good news on the approval for Big Sandy yesterday, but it looks like they have Plan B moving forward.  I will stay in touch with Kirk and keep you posted. 

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a "permit" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their "ducks in a row" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.
Kirk

Hi Kirk,

I just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was
going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me
know if we can do anything for you.

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk

I just read the order.  My congratulations  to each of you as well.  Job well done.  Now hopefully the Commissioners will issue an order consistent with the judges decision.  We all needed some good news!  By the way Drew you should probably come up with a better description of your past experiences than "outhouse lawyer".

Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

Steve:  I know you got involved with the group as a speaker so let me know if you want to continue getting the meeting notices.  Since Enron is a member, you and anyone else in your group is always welcome to attend.  I'll be sure to pass on any good info I pick up as I still have some options that are now seriously out of the money.  Take care.  Pat

Subject:	FW: SCG Advice 2837-A

After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the "direction" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		"If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties."

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus view=

e description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect t=
his case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I =
ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you wan=

  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my b=

positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements wil=
l be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on be=
half of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive c=
hanges are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for yo=
ur cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your indi=
vidual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's n=

Summary Risk Data as of 10/24/2001		
		
		
Active Financial Deals	51	
Active Physical al Deals	35	
P&L  Daily	545,890.37	
VaR	467,367.61	
		

Physical deals modelled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged phsycal positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance metholodogy, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


NOTE: We are reviewing the modelling of one of the financial deals which may have a significant impact on the numbers reported above.


Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: Another Fall Tradition
URL(s):

***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS MARKET LOOKS FOR THE ARRIVAL OF WINTER

Natural gas market participants are renewing the annual tradition of seizing on
each weather forecast for hints of the onset of winter weather. Although these
jitters have led to higher early-November prices, the winter market looks to be
well supplied owing to the combination of milder weather, depressed demand,
high storage levels, and ample production. December Henry Hub prices are
expected to average $2.70 per MMBtu.

* US gas storage inventories are estimated to leveled off at 3,107 billion
cubic feet (Bcf) by the end of October. Without harsher weather, the year-over-
year storage surplus should swell to over 770 Bcf by end-December.

* December demand will be significantly lower than in 2000 due largely to the
milder weather expected this year. While some industrial demand will return due
to lower gas prices, overall demand should be 11 percent lower than last year.

OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:

CPTH from $ .55 to $3.05 for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!
NVTL from $ .31 to $1.24 for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Royal Finance, Inc. (OTCBB: ROYA)
BUY AT $1.25
SELL TARGET $5.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER
COVERAGE FOR ROYA !

Revenues for ROYA, a fully-reporting, multi-faceted
financial services firm, have skyrocketed 500% higher
this year due to 10 Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,
placing rates at their lowest levels in over 4 decades.

ROYA is experiencing record breaking loan volume, real
estate sales, and mortgage refinancing as the rush is
on with rates having dropped to bargain basement levels.

We are expecting significant news regarding increasing
revenue and significant aquisitions, enhancing
the bottom line for rapid revenue growth.  The stock has
already bounced sharply from its 52-week low and will
continue moving up immediately. We think the stock could
easily climb above $5 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION
AS ROYA MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED
STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

They start at different periods because there are to two separate delivery points, one of which will require future construction by Southwest Gas.

Thanks babe. You are so sweet. I love being with you every day. That is why it is so hard for me when we go a week without being together (real close, that is). I will miss you too. Every time I think of you I will remember the ham (since you don't like them). Talk to you soon.

Love, 
	Steve

Don't forget to order your ham.

Love you.

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.

Hey Jim. How is everything going? Things have been kind of interesting around here lately as Enron is probably going to file for bankruptcy or renegotiate the merger deal it is working on with Dynegy. I'm not sure what it all means for me so I just take each day at a time.

I was searching through the internet (in my off-work time of course) and noticed that the price of YSR50s has really gone up. Do you still have yours? The price of one like yours is probably $2500 to $3000 now.

Jeanie mentioned that you might come down here after Christmas. Let me know what your plans are. Maybe Jeanie can get her act together and come down for at least one day also. She messed around so much over Thanksgiving that she ended up getting here on Saturday at 4pm and left Sunday moring at 11am. The kids were pretty disappointed since Jeanie had said they would be here for Thanksgiving. Oh well.

Hope everything is going well. Catch you later.

	Steve

All,

Looking back through my postings for TW, there was only one posting in the two month period in question that pertained to available capacity or open season. It was posted on Dec. 1,  2000  3:19PM .  Attached is that posting.

Subject:	TW Index Deals

It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several "packages" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).  If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it.  Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it?  

If we are going to be in a dogfight with BP on these deals, lets make sure we go in armed with as much of the relevant information as possible to demonstrate we were following the rules.  DF

This is late feedback, but wanted you to know that your presentation at the Directors Conference was well done. The expansion opportunities are exciting (and challenging), and I felt you used the opportunity well to thank and recognize some Operations folks who make the system work.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Steve,  I just stopped in the office on my way out to the airport and saw this.  I will call you on Monday to discuss so we can give it to Danny quickly.  Will Danny also want something similar on Questar?

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Danny wants to compile and asset development activities in one section for purposes of the upcoming business review with Mark Frevert and Greg Whalley.  I've developed a standard template for my projects (Alaska Highway, Sun Devil, Heat Recovery) and propose you do same for TransPecos.  Here's a rough draft for your consideration.  Please complete and return to me at your earliest convenience, preferably before Monday, close of play.

Thanks-

Eric

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.  
 
Bill

MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.  

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.  

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.    

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.

All,

Looking back through my postings for TW, there was only one posting in the two month period in question that pertained to available capacity or open season. It was posted on Dec. 1,  2000  3:19PM .  Attached is that posting.

Subject:	TW Index Deals

It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several "packages" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).  If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it.  Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it?  

If we are going to be in a dogfight with BP on these deals, lets make sure we go in armed with as much of the relevant information as possible to demonstrate we were following the rules.  DF

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

IGTT is able to triple the revenue and quadruple the
earnings generated from each customer by providing
improved connectivity, greater overall bandwidth, improved

Summary Risk Data as of 11/20/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	      83	
Active Physical Positions	      38

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

The economic evaluation of applying drag reducing agent to the La Plata to Bloomfield line indicates it is not justified.  Tracy indicated that if the launchers and receivers were installed as a part of the pipeline integrity program, the incremental cost of DRA application may then be economically beneficial.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this effort.

Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility 
Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
"We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT. For more information about the project and the terms of the open season, go to web site www.coppereagleGS.com <http://www.coppereagleGS.com> or telephone Russ Kovin at (832) 676-5659.

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

Subject:	Low Load GRI changes for 2002

Rosemary - Please forward to everyone in Marketing'
Raetta - Please forward to everyone in Gas Logistics.

The GRI rates will change, effective January 1,2002
Commodity changes from .0070 to .0055
High Load Reservation GRI (default) changes from .090 to .066
Low Load Reservation GRI changes from .0550 to .0407
Small Customer GRI (GS-T contracts) changes from .0110 to .0088

Marketers:
As the attached letter explains, I have redetermined which shippers are considered "Low Load" for the coming year.
The changes from Low to High or High to Low are listed in the letter.  A few customers flip-flop from year to year.  If any of your customers are affected, please advise them before January Reservation invoices go out (February 1, 2002).  NNG files a tariff change for the new rates, but does not file or mail out any notices about changes in a shipper's high/low load status.
 

John Williams/Gas Logistics - FYI.  The spreadsheet lists legal entities that are in the High Load or Low Load categories for 2002.
If a shipper is not listed, then it will default to the High Load GRI rate.

 
Call if you have questions.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Mark and Kim,

Please ask Steve Dowd to stand in for me for commercial steering/oversight - - - he's amply qualified/experienced for this endeavor and it fits his Corp Dev remit.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Mark

SoCalGas is circulating a draft pre-hearing conference statement for parties to sign on to, if they wish (please see attached).  Given Transwestern's position in the BCAP, it makes sense to sign on to SoCalGas' generic PHC statement.  Please take a few moments to review the same and let me know your thoughts.  SoCalGas has asked for a response by Tuesday noon.  Thanks.

To: Parties Who Participated in the A.01-09-024 (SoCalGas and SDG&E BCAP) Meet and Confer: 
  Attached is a proposed PHC Statement as required by ALJ Brown in her Ruling of November 5, 2001.  Per that Ruling, this Statement must be filed within 10 days of our meeting (which by my calculation would be the 26th of November).  I would REALLY like to get it filed on the 21st if possible, before the Thanksgiving weekend.
  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus views articulated at the meeting.  I tried not to go into too much detail on the description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect this case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you want to "sign on."  I will incorporate any non-substantive edits you may have.  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my best to incorporate.  However, let's remember that none of us want to be de-positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements will be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on behalf of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive changes are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for your cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your individual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's name off this one. 
Thanks again.

If you want, I can put an ad for your ysr on a site just for those bikes. I will need to know the year, miles, condition, does it have a title etc. 

I am still seeing Tracy. She went to Dallas for Thanksgiving but was back for the weekend. 

Jeanie had wanted me to loan her another $2500 so she could buy the car she had bid on in an auction  and was supposedly going to turn around and sell for a huge profit and pay me back the $2500 and the other $3000 I lent her. I told her I didn't have the money but somehow she came up with it. I think mom said Jeanie sold the car but I I don't know what happened to all the profit but Jeanie did send me a check for $75 (I think there were a few zeroes missing). 

I better go now the CNN trucks are outside the building (seriously). It's funny how the employees are always the last to know about what is going on. Take care.

Steve

Thank you Lindy for taking a look at this and providing us with your feedback.  At this time, however, we plan to hold off on attaching the subject tariff sheets to our reply brief.  We probably will make a separate tariff filing down the road.  Maria

Subject:	Capacity Posting Tariff Sheets

My other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows:

Section 35.2
	2nd paragraph, 3rd sentence.  Explanation of "incremental revenue".  When we talk about revenues which TW already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.  What if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet?  The language is so specific.  Can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what TW already has contractually committed?

	2nd paragraph, last sentence.  The phrase "guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate".  What does this mean?  TK & I were both a littles confused by this language.

	4th paragraph, 4th sentence.  The phrase "the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline".  TK, is the phrase "published indices" generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes?  I realize it will probably have to be something that is published.

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

rse rate must be granted the capacity bid on at the recourse rate.  We saw =
in this proceeding, however, that shippers were not treated equally and in =
nondiscriminatory manner (see e.g. our discussion in CPUC's reply brief of =
TW's total disregard for accuracy and equitable treatment regarding announc=
ement of delivery points ).

We also note that in your proposed tariff modification - last page of tarif=
f changes attachment to your outline of settlement - you do not provide for=
 evaluation of bids in a manner that would indeed assure shippers who bid f=
or the capacity they want at the recourse rate would get that capacity at t=
he recourse rate. If there are a number of bidders at the recourse rate and=
 some bidders at a negotiated rate that is not fixed at a rate below the re=
course rate, then the available capacity should first be prorated among the=
 recourse rate bidders, and the remainder allocated to negotiated rate bidd=
ers.  Unless this is done, TW cannot say that shippers who bid the recourse=
 rate are awarded the bid. If you include negotiated rates (not fixed below=
 recourse rate)in prorating the capacity allocation, then you are not imple=
menting the FERC's essential rationale that shippers must have the right to=
 bid for the capacity they want at the recourse rate if the pipeline is to =
be allowed use of negotiated rates. By prorating among negotiated rate ship=
pers, you are forcing shippers who only want to bid the recourse rate to en=
ter into a negotiated rate to get the total capacity they need. That underm=
ines  the FERC's only rationale for authorizing negotiated rates.

We think,therefore, that the next step would be for TW to draft a revision =
of the initial TW settlement offer expressing whatever changes TW is propos=
ing in response to Indicated Shippers comments and CPUC

s comments.   I will send in separate e-mail an outline of CPUC concerns re=
garding TW's original settlement offer. This outline summarizes the issues =
TW may want to consider if it revises that offer.

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.

*The decrease in active deals is from the early termination of both the NNG & TW ISDA agreements with RMTC effective 12/14/2001.  The increase in VaR is because the TW terminated contracts with RMTC have not yet been replaced.  The VaR is currently over the ETS VaR limit of $1,000,000.

Definitions:
Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport and storage agreements or unhedged natural positions.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

Subject:	Southern Trails Cancels Calif Part of Pipeline Conversion

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

Dear Steve

We need your feedback to better define leadership development for WEI.

As you may be aware the WEI Board has approved recommendations on how WEI
should evaluate our activities and then recognize the many people who
contribute to their design, development and delivery.  We will clearly
standardize how we evaluate "what" WEI does.  However, due to the very
different approaches used in the past to develop programs and people, the
Committee sees a strong to need clarify what members desire when it comes to
industry specific leadership development.

Following are a list of possible components of a WEI Industry Specific
Leadership Development program.  Will you please take a few minutes to rate
these components based on the value to you and to your organization?

To participate in the survey, simply reply to this email and hit send upon
completion.  And feel free to offer comments where appropriate.  Thank you
in advance for helping us by sharing your experiences and opinions.

Please rate the following components.
5 = essential
4 = important
3 = nuetral
2 = unnecessary.
Simply enter your rating at the front of each item.

(   ) Expand industry knowledge
(   ) Expand understanding of my work discipline
(   ) Develop increased confidence in groups
(   ) Develop/improve facilitation skills
(   ) Develop/improve public speaking
(   ) Learn to lead a group
(   ) Learn to effectively run a meeting
(   ) Improve self confidence in my work discipline
(   ) Learn to develop group consensus
(   ) Other, please list ______________________________________________

As a participant in the past, please name the three most important
leadership skills you feel you have gained through active participation.
1.
2.
3.

Also, please identify the single most important leadership related benefit
you have gained through active participation.
1.

(   ) I don't believe WEI should provide industry specific leadership
development

Thank you for your feedback and for your terrific involvement in WEI!

Terry Sullivan
President

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift Toward Winter 	
URL(s):

***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

Subject: Fw: PG&E's Gas Accord II application
Importance: High


Gentlemen,

Attached is PG&E's Gas Accord II application, filed as directed by the
Commission last month in D.01-09-016.  It is captioned as the, "Application
of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (U 39 G) Proposing a Market Structure
and Rules for the Northern California Natural Gas Industry for the Period
Beginning January 1, 2003."  The Commission Order required, "an application
proposing a market structure, rates, and terms and conditions of service
relating to the PG&E gas transmission and storage system for the period
beginning January 1, 2003, when most of the provisions of the existing 'Gas
Accord' are scheduled to expire."  There is no testimony attached.  Instead,
PG&E notes that, "the service of supporting testimony at the time an
application is filed is not required by the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure."  They say that testimony, if any, would be filed after a
prehearing conference is scheduled.  The utility suggests December 17 for
the conference.

In summary, PG&E requests Commission authorization to extend the existing,
approved Gas Accord market structure and rates for a two-year period.  Under
this proposal, those provisions of the Gas Accord currently scheduled to
expire as of January 1, 2003, will be extended through December 31, 2004,
while other provisions of Gas Accord scheduled to expire as of April 1, 2003
(consisting of certain storage-related provisions) will be extended through
March 31, 2005.  As noted by the utility, "This approach would not preclude
parties from proposing specific, justified operational or other limited
changes during the two-year extension period.  However, as discussed below,
parties seeking to obtain Commission approval of changes in the Gas Accord
regime, and thus to alter the status quo, must bear the brden of proof on
such issues."  If the simple, two-year extension of the Gas Accord is
adopted as requested, PG&E says it will waive the 2.5 percent escalation for
the two-year Gas Accord II extension period.

The application also notes that on September 20, 2001, shortly after
issuance of D.01-09-016,  PG&E filed a Plan of Reorganization with the
Bankruptcy Court, which, if adopted, would substantially restructure PG&E's
existing business operations.   As proposed, the Plan of Reorganization
would alter the regulation of PG&E's natural gas transmission and storage
system, as the utility's gas transmission and storage operations would be
transferred from PG&E to a new corporation, and operated under exclusive
FERC jurisdiction.   Assuming FERC accepted such jurisdiction, the CPUC
would no longer would have jurisdiction over the rates or terms and
conditions of service on the PG&E gas transmission and storage system.  Your
thoughts on this development would also be appreciated.

I assume we need to review this application to determine its potential
impact on Transwestern and that we should, of course, monitor the proceeding
generally to determine if any active role is required at a later date.  What
are the fundamental issues that concern Transwestern when considering PG&E?
How do you feel about FERC jurisdiction of its transmission/storage systems?

Finally, note that PG&E states that, "...contributing to uncertainty in the
gas markets is the large number of interstate pipeline construction projects
that have been proposed.  It will take at least a year or two before the
viability and impacts of those various pipeline projects can be confirmed in
the marketplace."  The utility also includes a footnote 9 that references
the Transwestern Red Rock FERC application (as well as seven other projects)
as pending at FERC.

Let's discuss at your convenience.

Dan

Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
northern California natural gas industry, beginning
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
application.

Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
"We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s," said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. "Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather." 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
"This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather," said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

SoCalGas is circulating a draft pre-hearing conference statement for parties to sign on to, if they wish (please see attached).  Given Transwestern's position in the BCAP, it makes sense to sign on to SoCalGas' generic PHC statement.  Please take a few moments to review the same and let me know your thoughts.  SoCalGas has asked for a response by Tuesday noon.  Thanks.

To: Parties Who Participated in the A.01-09-024 (SoCalGas and SDG&E BCAP) Meet and Confer: 
  Attached is a proposed PHC Statement as required by ALJ Brown in her Ruling of November 5, 2001.  Per that Ruling, this Statement must be filed within 10 days of our meeting (which by my calculation would be the 26th of November).  I would REALLY like to get it filed on the 21st if possible, before the Thanksgiving weekend.
  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus views articulated at the meeting.  I tried not to go into too much detail on the description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect this case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you want to "sign on."  I will incorporate any non-substantive edits you may have.  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my best to incorporate.  However, let's remember that none of us want to be de-positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements will be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on behalf of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive changes are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for your cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your individual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's name off this one. 
Thanks again.

Hi beautiful. I had a hard time yesterday because I missed you so much (in case you couldn't tell). The more we are together the more I love you and want to spend all my time with you. I can't wait to see you.

Stan's staff meeting was cancelled so I am just trying to catch up on things this morning.

Love you sweetie.

Subject: TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)



DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to "shippers", we could refer to "customers" instead.

Subject:	RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.
Laura Watton

The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

Subject:	Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
"The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market," FERC said in its draft order. "Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate." 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, "given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California." 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was "extremely successful," adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
"The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States," said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
"We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region," said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
"Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent," said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. "We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 29, 2001
ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff "so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was "a tortuous process." 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While "both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof," the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.  The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. "Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power." 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the "index-to-index" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate "to minimize any risk on transportation options." The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.

Subject: TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)



DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Do you still have the bike and would it be possible to ship it to Houston, Texas? I am very interested. Thanks.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Hi Greg. Thanks for the info. When you say it has the optional headlight fairing, etc., does that mean they are not on the bike? What color is the bike? Do you have a number I can reach you at so we can discuss it further? I am very interested and would like to see what we can work out. I need to know what city and zip code the bike is in to find out how much it would be to ship it. Thanks.

Hi Steve, yes I still have the bike for sale, I just decided to sell it last friday (11/23).  I hate to part with it, but I'm trying to raise capital to fund a business venture.  I don't have any pictures of it, but I can borrow my girlfriends digital camera and get you some; however, I won't see her until this friday (11/30), and we are heading out of town until 12/4.  I'll try to see if I can do anything before then, but I can't say for sure, as I don't own a computer or any computer equipment.  I only have computer access at my job.  In reference to shipping cost to Texas, shipping company's usually charge by size, weight, and distance travelled.  The bike doesn't weigh that much, but you'd probably have to check with a truck line to verify a freight prices.  In regard to the title, I do have the title, but
it's still in the person's name that I purchased the bike from.  He had it licensed, with tags on it, and rode it on the street.  I bought it just as a pit/play bike.  I take it to local motorcycle races on a trailer as a pit bike and ride it around my neighborhood, so I never licensed it to keep from paying sales tax.  If it becomes an issue, I can retitle it in my name. The unit has somewhere around 980 miles on it, and it has the optional headlight fairing and engine/radiator shroud/cowl.  The only thing that I did to it when I bought it was change all the fluids, lube, check everything over and adjust things as needed.  Let me know if you have any further questions or need more info.

Thx.

Greg Rowe

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Evaluation - No Go

The economic evaluation of applying drag reducing agent to the La Plata to Bloomfield line indicates it is not justified.  Tracy indicated that if the launchers and receivers were installed as a part of the pipeline integrity program, the incremental cost of DRA application may then be economically beneficial.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this effort.

I also wanted to pass on to you the estimated costs that were used:

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.

The re-application time period is also uncertain.  The probable window would be to re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.
