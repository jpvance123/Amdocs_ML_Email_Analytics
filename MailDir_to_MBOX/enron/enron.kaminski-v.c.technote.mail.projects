Hi Bob,

some comments :
1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after 
limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  
I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the 
trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and 
offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this 
target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and 
without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron 
position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.
2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful 
trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), 
would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval 
(time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need 
the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of 
order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as 
the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed 
of execution (something to check).

Jeff,

I am forwarding an analysis put together by Sandeep Kohli and reviewed by 
Vince and me.  The results in the attached word document show that Dabhol 
energy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 MW of distributed 
generation which has been identified in Maharastra.  This 600 MW does not 
include innumerable small generators which will have even worse energy 
costs.  The excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations.

Stinson

Vince/Stinson,

Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as 
well as the revised statement that can be made to press.

The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of 
the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the 
gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating 
in homes, and commercial establishments.

Hope ths helps.

Regards,
Sandeep.

I am looking for a list and description of the weather risk management

to know what  traders' reactions to significant weather are. And where
can I find a list of popular weather instruments with descriptions?

I appreciate any help you can give me. I would like to set up a chat

Amy,

I think that Rick Causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a 
reasonable decision.

We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain 
clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a 
rather
vague concept of what they want to accomplish.

Vince




To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc:  
Subject: MIT/AA Lab- next meeting

Vince: Can you shed any light on this? I'm confused (really confused).... 
Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only 
by Kean, Buy and Koening? And
Do you think this means that we shouldn't meet on Thurs?
Personally, I think Enron really needs to meet on Thurs to buckle down and 
start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the 
Lab. 
>From a practical perspective, if we can't get what we want from this whole 
thing, Rick's issue of "where AA is going with this" is really a mute point, 
isn't it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort. 
Would appreciate your insight and advice.
Thanks.

Beth,
 
I  enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible Enron/Argonne  
National Laboratory collaboration. As I mentioned, one of our  divisions, 
Decision Information Sciences has built state of the art tools  for modeling 
and simulating energy use. They have trained many country  energy ministries 
on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy  technology issues.
 
I've  attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in 
this area.  Decision Information Sciences also has done much work in studying 
critical  infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also 
may be of  interest. Finally, they have been pioneers in the development of 
agent  based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that  
are impossible to view with over approaches.
 
I will also include a copy of my  correspondences with one of your e-business 
groups under separate  transmission.

Per our Monday meeting, the time line for completion of the "Phase I" 
forecasting project (Hourly System Load & Next Day Load) is as follows:  
 Aug. 15 - Sept. 15 (Data Collection)
 Sept. 15 - Oct. 15 (Modeling)
 Oct. 15 - Nov. 15 (System Development and Testing)
If any questions arise between now and the end of August, contact Barbara 
Dillard, but as of Sept. 1, I will be the Chicago lead for this and other 
forecasting projects and will be available to handle any questions or issues.

Amitava,

Can you schedule a brainstorming session with Vasant, Tanya, Rakesh, myself
and Ben (if possible)? 

What about the trip on Monday. Has it been scheduled?

The following is a good summary from Vasant about the projects and what is 
ahead of us.
Ben, please let me know when things are ready; I can plan my trip accordingly.
Thanks, 
Amitava



EnronCredit.com is working on 3 main models --- the FMC model, the Placement 
model, and the Movement model.
FMC Model : provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33 
industry offsets.  Each day, this model takes the previous day's trader 
curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed 
swap prices.
Placement Model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using 
dummified ranges for Market Capitalization, Liquidity, KMV Score, etc.  One 
main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade 
names.  Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for 
separate sunsets of names.
Movement Model : provides an alert system for news.  This is under 
development.

Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the 
development/modifications of the Placement Model, especially in thinking 
through the various single vs multi model approaches.  We can help in the 
brainstorming for better models for subsets.  One main project right now is 
to get a separate model for subsidiaries, and to exclude subsidiary names 
from the main regression.

Value-at-risk is based on historical variance-covariance approach.

The portfolio model is under development.

Agenda for Houston Research Group members : 

Once sufficient data is collected, start reviewing for potential analytic 
relationships.
Get weekly updates from London, and provide feedback.
Plan on a trip if the work warrants it, once the agenda is fairly well drawn 
out, and data is available for analysis.

Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.

The next step is to incorporate the intra-day market movement by using high 
and low
prices into the pricing.  I will call you on Monday.

Happy Thanksgivings !

Zimin

Subject: Petrochem Desk

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

>From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

We have prepared the attached two reports to accompany the Thai baht forecast 
we produced on 13 September 2000 (the previous curve was dated 15 May 2000).

The first report provides specific economic factors that formed the basis for 
our baht forecast decisions in September.

The second report is an analysis of PPP theory and foreign exchange 
forecasting with a detailed discussion of its propriety to the economic 
outlook and exchange rate forecast for Thailand.

Hi Amitava,

     As we discussed this morning, I have created the attached spreadsheet 
for our "to dos" for the the credit guys.

     Please take a look at it to make sure it is okay, make any changes, etc.

     In the mean time I will work on the data vendor research, order Eviews, 
etc......


Thanks,

I set up the simulation model.  The margin follows a mean-reverting process.

I seperarted the data into two category, margin >0.04  and margin <0.04.
Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets.
I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data 
set.

The high MR speed surpresses the probability at high payout side.
Since the MR speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so Bob will run 
a few senarios.

I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium 
calculation, so the
the result in E18 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal 
pricing.
I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar 
worth.

Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread 
option
approach that Bob and Lee set up.  

Look like we got a reasonable model.



Stinson:
I'd like to have you check my set up for the simulation model.

Lee and Douglas:
You can play with the model, and let me know what do you think.

Bob:
We need  run different price curve senarios using the simulation model.   
plus different MR speed.

I am helping Doug for building a model to price power spread options he saw
in the market. This includes  power capacity, transmission, heating rate 
options, etc. 

I do not have the access to the power curves in  M:\power2\Region  as I used 
to.   
I need your permission to regain  the read-only access to the curves.   

Thanks in advance.

Kevin,

 the memo looks good.  One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can 
deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the 
memo indicates that a lot of work has been done, the reader might want to 
know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.  
You will of course describe everything in your presentation, but given that 
setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some 
template/model and send it with brief explanations.  For example, a template 
for TRS as it stands, and a template listing trigger events and how the 
results will be displayed.  You can then expand on this in your presentations.

I'll send you the DASH that was done previously for the used LNG tanker, the 
Mystic Lady (now renamed as the Hoegh Galleon).  The analysis used in this 
transaction was not detailed due the short time-frame we had to analyze this 
transaction as well as to Enron's right to terminate this charter for 
convenience.

We are presently working on the analysis for a second, new-build LNG tanker.  
When this analysis has progressed far enough that we have a draft DASH, I 
will forward it to you (this may be later this week).

Regards,

Dave

Michael

I have got CSFB working on the amendment you asked for.

In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market 
values of the water companies and the RAB of the industry since 
privatisation.  The following points come out
1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB
2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 1997 and end 
1998 when the ratio was c1.5x.
3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has 
been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal 
significantly.  Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in 
share prices in the last year

Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of 
water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market 
value ratio is a straight average.  Obviously that influences the numbers a 
little.

On CustomerCo.  CSFB have contacted around 7 energy companies.  The result 
has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise.  I 
await a revised fee proposal but CSFB have been advised that it should be 
more modest than the last one !

Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

Subject: Daten


Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources
made available some proprietary historical forward price curves
from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were
used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine
years"

Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

Olaf Korn

Andy,

Sounds good. One comment: Vasant is swamped with work coordinating
several high profile projects. 

Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support
internally from other members of the group: this contribution
may not be directly visible but it will be still very important.

We appreciate your hands-on involvement. It's always the most
important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent interaction
with the customer. Look fwd to working on this project.

Guys,

Here is what I took away from our meeting:

1). Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline data.

2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data

3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort, presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the right track.

If this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can discuss.

Thanks,
Andy

You will find the most recent email exchanges below.  Per our discussion, I did sit down with Christian last week to talk about a fundamental/econometric approach to forward curve construction as was done for the agricultural efforts.

Please review the "Curve Model2K" file which was built by research a few years back for Plastics trading group.  I would like to work with you or someone in research as far as building the same model for all Petrochemical products.

The "Benz_Curve" file is what I have done so far but it is very primitive compare to the other model.  Let me know what I need to do going forward.

What kind of crude price volatility are you proposing to use (NYMEX)?  As I recall, we did find some relationship between the time series price variable and one of the S&D terms that you had placed in the excel worksheet.  There was no relationship with lagged price either?  If you don't mind, please forward the data to me so that I can take a quick look at it.

For GBM, I was thinking about using crude volatility.  Unfortunately, supply and demand is not a good indicator of predicting prices because of the economic complexity of processing aromatics.  Statistically, there is no relationship between utilization, supply, demand and price.  Inserting time lag does not make the number any better either.

Hi Christian,

Both mean reversion and GBM models assume that all information related to a future price may be found in the historical price.  The approach employed in the ag curves suggests that there may be some fundamental information related to supply and demand that impacts also drives future price.  A portion of the mean reversion process is actually captured with inclusion of lagged prices  (autoregressive component).  A GBM process requires some information on price volatility.  Since there is presumably no forward/future curve for the commodity of interest, it is difficult to come up with historical volatility values.  Hope it helps.

Nelson

It probably makes sense for you to directly coordinate the signing of the 
contract for Henwood.    Attached is another copy of the earlier email 
containing a draft contract provided by Bonnie Nelson in legal.    She would 
still  like to change section 6 on exclusivity.   Her number in Houston is

Stinson,

Attached please find a draft Consulting Agreement for use with Henwood.  

You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section 
6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and 
Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if 
that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K. 
law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law, 
would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so 
I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).

I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwood's proposal, and 
believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in 
their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the "Business Conduct" and 
"Drug Policy" language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement 
allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.  
Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost 
plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Vince:

I plan to be in Houston on July 5-7.  I would like very much to get together
with you and perhaps your investment guy on Friday morning on the 7th if you
and/or he have the time or perhaps on the 5th in the afternoon.  I would
like to continue the discussions about your using MarketPoint and about your
investment guy considering MarketPoint if he is interested.  When you see
the progress we have made, I think you will agree that it merits
consideration as a part of enrononline.com as well as a profitable
investment in its own right.  It is still in the situation where it can be
provided exclusively to whomever I choose; I have been very, very careful
how I have promoted it so that I do not get committed to a second-rate
partner.

I also have what I think is a fundamentally new, general Markovian forward
optionality evaluator.  I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation at Stanford in the
1970s (defended with honors) in semi-Markovian decision processes during the
heyday of that research, and I have seen direct applications in optionality
evaluation.  I think you will be fascinated to see and review it. It is
presently implemented in prototype form and it could be made available to
the first large retainer client on an exclusive basis who is sufficiently
interested.  If you want to be that retainer client, that would be of
interest to me.

Give me a shout via return email or by my cell phone at 650.218.3069
regarding schedule.  I am out of town this week but available via email or
phone at the above addresses.

I really hope we can get together that week if we possibly can.  Thanks very
much for considering my request, and thanks very much for being the go
between with your investment guy.  I deeply appreciate it.  I hope to see
you on the 5th or 7th.

Michelle,
Helen, Cecil, David (just joined the effort) and I had a meeting this 
morning. A lot of things regarding
the coding has been discussed. We all felt good about the progress that has 
been made
and have clear idea of how to proceed.  The project is speeding up nicely.

Best,
Alex

Ryan:

This is the updated spreadsheet for pricing the LJM options disregarding any 
credit issues. It produces exactly the same results as before. The only 
difference tis the place it gets the model's c code. I am placing all the 
code related to this deal on a specific directory on the "o" drive now. 
Please use this version on future pricing. I will delete the old code.




Thanks

Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling
President and C.O.O.,
Enron Corp.

Dear Jeff,

This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope
you recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my
1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to
introduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an
innovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy
Seshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders
of SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific Advisory
Board. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your
keynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and
has been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with
JP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed
Colloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.
of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge
value-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, I
don't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by
Bob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.

SKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in
electronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative
Trading Systems). It achieves this through a process of "strategic
negotiation" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).
Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to
any extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our
initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,
e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power
instruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other
web-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron
Online.

SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:
1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,
bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,
the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth
available, continguity of the allocation, and such.)
2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to "static" matching.
3) It is multi-lateral.
4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.
5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in
traditional markets.

Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at
Fidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,
Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,
Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.

We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any
other Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.
SKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your
representative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in
a meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange
something appropriate.

Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.

With warm regards,
Joseph Cherian and Robert Jarrow

Gentlemen,

 John Norden will be in Sydney on Monday morning to evaluate the IT process.  
He will coordinate with Stinson. 

 Spoke to Vince K today and asked if he would send Stinson Gibner to Sidney 
to be available on Monday to review the X system.
Paul, make sure our X friends are available and the Confidentially Agreement 
is signed.  Further, I spoke to Phillip B. about a technical going too.

G'day mates,

George just "remembered" the traders' meetings Monday and Wednesday 
afternoons at 3:30. He' s going to email you- I think Tuesday would ensure a 
turnout of traders as well as analysts. We  could easily have 20 people there 
from Power alone, and there's always Gas .... When you decide the time,  can 
you ask Shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30C1?

Vince-

I spoke with Tom, and I completely agree and would like to hand all this EOL 
stuff over to you.

We need a Sun server to take over the task. As it happens Martin Lin has one 
in his office he's not using and up to the task. His box could serve SAS to 
Enron, as well as handle listening in on the EOL feedds and maintaining its 
database.

Martin's box technically belongs to EBS, but I think they are downsizing and 
wouldn't mind giving it up.

In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody over 
the data and any work you do with it. I needn't be involved, and you can know 
your work is completely confidential.

I'll make SAS and the EOL software available, as well as the necessary RAM 
the server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some SysAdmin resources 
to finish the job. There is a fine Unix guy named Ben Thompson who will 
support you, I'm sure.

Task:

1) Upgrade RAM on Martin's server
2) Install newest Solaris OS on server
3) Install Tibco and GNU software on server
4) Install SAS on server

Subject: Costless Collar for Hanover  

Ryan and I have looked at the research model and made some adjustments.  
The treasury rate at 12/28/00 was 5.127% (research uses 4.6% which probably 
takes into account the recent Fed 50 bp cut)
The maturity is 6/30/03 or 2.5 years (research uses 3 years)

Using these assumptions and a 47.2% volatility in the Bloomberg collar 
function results in a ceiling of 92 103/256 and a floor of 34 7/8.  After 
adjusting the research model for the changes above, Ryan and I got a similar 
range from the research model so we are comfortable with these numbers.

Let me know if there are any questions.

Attached is the updated valuation from Bob Lee in Research using the actual 
3-year historical vol. of 47.2 which results in a call strike of 97.978.  
Also, he has confirmed that the presence of the swap has no impact on the

Here's the calculation using the historical volatility.  The strike drops 
slightly.  The volatility in the calculation is the expected future 
vol;atility - looking at traded options for HC and an expected fall off in 
vol for long dated options, one could justify a vol estimate in the range 40 
- 50% for the collar.

The presence of the swap makes no difference on the collar valuation.

Gentlemen:

Enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research 
endeavor called the New Economy Value Research Lab. The Lab is the result of 
a joint effort between MIT's Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen 
(AA). Its purpose is to develop "quantitative valuations of the intangible 
assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy" (Business 
Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to 
intangible asset based organization, the question of "how to" accurately and 
appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly 
important.

Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a 
team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MIT's lead 
accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected 
outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was 
made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1) 
define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify 
value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate. 
Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will 
be determined.

Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and

This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for 
trading future of a movie's gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many 
people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide 
some feedback.

I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We 
can call it "Dynamic bid-ask price process".
In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is 
submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final 
(clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last "tentative" price shown to 
the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the 
final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)

I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via 
EnronOnline.com.

Subject: calculating bid-ask prices


I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to 
forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, 
we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some 
positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the 
studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the 
price easily.

One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange 
system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading 
period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post 
"tentative" bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their 
acceptable buying or selling price. These "tentative" bid-ask prices get 
updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw 
their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we 
calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower 
selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer 
who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask 
price. Next week, we repeat the same process.

This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a 
broker where we don't take any position at all. We make profit from those 
bid-ask spread. We don't have to worry about forecasting accuracy and 
insiders' trading because we don't have to take any position. Let the market 
be the one who decides the price. 

If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual 
gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers 
with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the 
mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

Thanks,
-Chonawee

Subject: some more input

Hi Rich and Key,
Again I think your idea is very good. I think that we, as a market maker, can 
reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the "mark-to-market" 
charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the 
gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way 
as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the 
couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money.
In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined 
from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price 
should go up.)
We can offer other derivative products such as options as well.

Vince-

I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the "transaction dollars" 
on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index 
trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isn't, inadvertently, 
recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the 
contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis 
trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to 
them of the "price" as the basis, times the quantity.

I'm sorry I wasn't ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accuracy 
very seriously.

Vince,

Before I contact the London staff about next Wednesday's meeting, I was 
wondering if we could move it up a little bit.  The reason is that by 2pm in 
Houston it is 8pm in London and I thought it might be difficult to round up 
the crew in London at that time.  Please let me know if we have plans to 
change the time.

Thanks,

Eric

Subject: Petrochem Desk

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

>From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Vince and Vasant:

For the record, the April HH future closed last Monday at $2.72, and is now 
trading at $2.97, a 9% rise in less than one week.

For the record, Enron's technical "experts" strongly advised selling this 
contract last week, predicting a "collapse."

Badri,

In the event DPC signs the contract, we would need to make it Indian tax 
efficient. PLease suggest the structure/clauses/information required by which 
we need not pay withholding taxes. If you need more info on the scope of work 
contemplated you can talk to Wade/Neil/Sandeep.

Subject: Re: CA for Henwood engagement

Wade/Mohan,

Please find below the last draft copy of the Henwood Consulting Agreement.  
We need to sign this asap so as to not be in violation of ENE policies.

As you will see, the draft Agreement is made out with Enron in mind, even 
though we have left the company name blank in the agreement.

Mohan - Last when we spoke (Friday), you were going to explore the tax 
aspects of having DPC be the signing company.  Please tell us if that works.

Separately, you and Wade may need to consider how DPC lenders may look upon 
some of the information emerging from this study, and whether you want all of 
it in lender domain.

Based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be EIPL, ENE 
Houston, or DPC.  We could also have a version where ENE Houston is signing 
the contract on behalf of DPC.

Please let me know what you decide, and we will proceed accordingly.  If you 
would like someone in EIPL/DPC to be signing the contract, please let me 
know, who the signing authority is.  I suspect, that even I could sign on 
behalf of DPC or ENE ??  If so, I will be in Houston on Wednesday, and sign 
at the time.  If not, you can assign someone to sign.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Please find attached a revised version of the draft Consulting Agreement with 
Henwood.  FYI, I am attaching both a clean version and one marked toshow 
changes from the last draft I sent you.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions or comments on the agreement or the most recent changes.  

 

WHat is the status of Henwood?  Do you still want to engage them and what is 
the timeframe for their work (the dates in the draft may need to be 
corrected). 

Bruce and Lauren:  please advise on which Enron entity should be the party to 
this Consulting Agreement.

Jeff,

We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the 
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from 
what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that 
John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact 
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not 
allow it, so he was using 0.999.

We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If 
you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just 
let me know what time would be convenient.

Mark & Todd

Vince and I have been working along those lines and have narrowed the search 
to (1) Scripps Institution of Oceanography, (2) Lamont-Daugherty Earth 
Observatory, and (3) COLA - Center for Ocean, Land and Atmosphere.  We have 
contacted the principles at each of these institutions, made on-site visits 
to the facilities, and verbaly explored preliminary research program 
proposals.

Perhaps we could meet next week to coordinate this effort.

Subject: Re: Benchmarking Study  

I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their 
thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.  
Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by 
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the 
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and 
I will follow through on that if you would like.  

Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good 
one for you.  --Sally

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for Enron's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have Enron participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,

I am trying to retrieve some analysis that I did while I was in Houston. It 
is very imporatant that I get these files asap as I need to continue the 
correlation analysis for the UK Power/Gas desk. I have put in a request to 
the Resolution Center in Houston to try and get a back up but 
would like to know if anyone has any further suggestions? I was not told that 
the files in this folder were periodically deleted.
I think Tanya should have a copy of these files but do not know where she is 
likely to store them.
Thanks in advance,

Michelle,
The project is progressing. Helen has done a great job,  finding various flaws
in the initial design (Ken's design) of the Access table, and has been going 
back
and forth with Ken to modify the table. Since Helen can't devote full time to 
this project,
Chris has hired a contractor, Cecil Stradford, to do the coding. I have 
spoken with
Cecil just now and he says no coding has been done yet. I am trying to 
arrange 
a meeting today with Cecil, Helen, Christin (the one who's overseeing coding 
process in Cecil's company) and myself.  Will report back to you on what
is discussed in the meeting. 

Best,
Alex

Subject: cost sharing of subscription to Poten's Fuel Oil Report  

All:
Ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many P&L's as need the 
report, minimizing everyone's cost by sharing a single subscription. 
Please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so, the RC 
code & co# for me to allocate your cost share.  Please indicate your choice 
of the three cost choices.

Attached note below clarifies Poten's proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription.
Essentially we have three choices:
1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly 
"special feature" article)
2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly 
"special feature" article, as in three attached examples)
3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for 
36 months.

Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No 
one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an 
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to 
others in the corporation.
The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles:
99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean
99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere
99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile
One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.  Some may 
be useless, others perhaps quite valuable.  Your call. 

regards
Guy

Dear Guy,

It was a pleasure speaking to you today.

As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part
fuel-oil related service:

(1) a one-year subscription to Poten's Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium
Edition), and

(2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest
Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S
FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would
be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price
projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be
accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over
the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.

The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal
installments

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Larry

Subject: Poten's Fuel Oil Report

Niamh & Doug & Margaret:
I want to chat about this and will call you, but the essence is:

Can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to Poten's Monthly Fuel Oil 
Report? 
Attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month 
price forecasts.  The cost is $3800/yr.
As an added service for a total of $10,000/yr, Poten will include a quarterly 
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and FO prices with a brief 
justification for their view.  This would include the standard monthly price 
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24 
months for Far East, Med and NWE.  (I expect a more descriptive email from 
Poten, but I think this is the essence of their "custom" offer.)

The example copies attached include the following Special Features:
99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean
99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere
99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile
These type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects 
related to fuel oil.

I have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price 
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself 
regarding the utility of such a report.  The best way to show your 
recommendation is with money.  If it is not worth any money to anyone else in 
ENE, then I have to question its validity and utility to me as well.  Doug, 
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure 
to FO prices?

best regards
Guy

Bob,
Here are a few comments on this note:
1. Deal with seismic company was done by a Mark Peterson who is still with 
Enron.  I haven't caught up with him for details but it had to do with 
underwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey.  Timing is important.  
Interest may have picked up in new surveys and the survey company decided 
that they didn't need Enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no 
sales.  

2. 3-D surveys will happen where there is an abundance of E & P activity or 
be spurred on by successes in a given basin.  While activity continues in the 
Gulf of Mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the 
deep water.  Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and 
worked for years - they were accessible with the extraction technology of the 
time.  I don't think that deep water sedimentation /depositional systems were 
completely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water.  
Concepts have evolved quite quickly.  The point is that many deep water 
accumulations are incredibly large - billion barrel accumulations.  These 
sizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companies 
were drilling surface structures.  The large reserves are needed to pay for 
the corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development.  
I believe that finding and development costs ($/barrel) are at least two to 
three times shelf f & d costs in the Gulf of Mexico.  This differential is 
probably large with international projects (and that doesn't take into 
account political risk). 

I'll look forward to more involvement if and when this project /concept goes 
forward.  Feel free to forward this to all participants.  

Greg

I am preparing a summary or our Thursday discussions to be used as a 
background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders.  I will 
circulate this for review/correction later today, or ,at the latest, Monday.

Greg, you mentioned that Enron had participated in a speculative survey in 
the Gulf of Mexico that was successful.  It might be useful to get more info 
on this.  Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not 
continued to do this, etc.

Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3-D surveys are in deep 
water.  I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep sea 
drilling/extraction project in the Gulf.  What oil price is required to make 
these kinds of projects viable financially?

Thanks for the clarification Vince I appreciate it. We have a significant 
resource problem here in India, given we have a renegotiation about fall in 
our laps. Anshuman is one of our key analysts and we are very proud of his 
abilities and future potential for Enron. Once we have Dabhol off the "life

Subject: Anshuman

Neil,

I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman.
We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion
regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep
every few days).

Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month
to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request). The lawyers advised
me that we need an L1  visa  for him, irrespective of the duration
of  his stay.

Sorry for the confusion.

Grant,

Can Research in Houston put together a comparison of the long-term volatility 
curves for gas and power in North America and Europe?  Based on where Europe 
is marked (especially for the UK), I think we'll find a significant 
difference out beyond 10 years.  Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term 
vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.

Has Research done any work on this in the past?  If not, we should study this 
since long-term vol feeds into the VAR-based position limits.

Give me a call so we can discuss.

Thanks

Dale

Vince,
The PSerc meeting Lance and I went to was both interesting
and boring. PSerc has 11 school members  and 30 industry members. Its Research
Program consists of three stems:  Markets, Transmission and Distribution,
and Systems. (Enron's interests probably lie mainly in the first stem.) 

In morning of the first day, researchers from universities
presented their project proposals. I found some of them 
quite interesting. For example, Shmuel Oren, Fernando Alvarado,
Tim Mount (of Cornell) propose to study "Market Redesign: Incorporating
the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market
design,"  Shijie Deng, S. Oren et al propose to study " Power asset
valuation model in a market-based and reliability-constrained electric
power system." The first got funded but the second did not. 

In the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their
own discussion. I went to the academic discussion and Lance the
industry one.  I hope my presence there did not make things worse, for
the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion. 
The proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants. 

The proposal process goes as follows: researchers first write a short 
proposal to appropriate stem committee (no industry participantion, it seems 
to me),
each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4. The 
selected
proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry.  Industry then
gets to vote which proposals get funded.  However, some researchers were
very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process. There were
accusation of self-ranking, communication between stem committee and
member schools breaking down, and so on. Some were even asking for 
some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before  wrting it 
(the arguement was "Then it was a waste of our time to write proposals", 
which I found quite amusing). 

All in all, I found the process was not taken seriously enough by university 
researchers. PSerc has been established for 5 years now and it still does 
not have a proper proposal screen process, which is hard to believe. Also, 
the communication among university researchers, between stem committee 
and member schools, and most importantly, between researchers and industry, 
are not  smooth as all.

Since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members, the "right"
projects may not get funded. Too many participants also make the decision
process very indecisive and quite painful to watch (Lance can comment on
this better).  They also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which
made the voting a less authoritive.

I believe Enron will not get much returns from join PSerc (price tag is 
$40,000
per company per year).  If we find some projects interesting, we can sponsor
the schools in the form of summer interns, the schools claim that most of the 
fund
goes to support students anyway.

Subject: Introduction


Vince:

   As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then
about CDS,
the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest
privately owned
manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing 
its
finances,
so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual
revenue and
to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the
business of
manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))
food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other
products.

Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that
emphasizes the
long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win
solutions with
its suppliers, customers and partners.

As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its
expenses
goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of
researching
those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand
(people
eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).

CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very
successful,
with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in
these arenas.
CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports 
the
purchasing
function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a
multidiscipline and
multinational team with a lot to offer.

Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based
on
manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in 
this
area.
Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to
talk to.

In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to
anything
at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to
pursue the opportunity
we discussed in the future.

I am looking forward to our video conference call.

Kind regards,

Avi

Hi Maureen,

It was good to meet you last week and hear your presentation on the metals - 
full of advice on what to think about and all the various things that affect 
the market place.  I am only sorry I had to dash off to the airport - good 
job I left when I did though as check-in took ages!

Anyway, please could you send me through a copy of that presentation either 
on email or if it is located on the network somewhere then I could access it 
over the intranet?  I will be joining the LME conference tomorrow so am 
currently trying to do a bit of reading in preparation.

Thanks very much in advance & look forward to seeing the presentation over 
here in London.

Kind Regards
Alison

Subject: Good news - Cabinet approval for Power Trading

Team: Today Union Cabinet has approved the proposal of Ministry of Industry 
to allow foreign equity participation in power trading. This was conveyed by 
Secretary (Power) during his meeting with Wade. In normal course, the 
proposal was slated to be coming up for Cabinet in next few weeks. Keeping in 
view the developments of DPC invoking State Guarantee, perhaps Cabinet has 
hurried it up. 

The exact proposal approved was - "to allow foreign equity participation 
through automatic route upto 100% for trading in power sector, subject to 
prevailing laws." 

Irrespective of urgency of this approval to us, the best thing is that we are 
getting the approval without Draft Electricity Bill, 2001 being finalised. As 
most of you are aware, initially the proposal was stalled at FIPB level 
pending finalisation of Electricity Bill. Then it has gone to Group of 
Ministers who had taken a positive approach and now the Cabinet has cleared 
it. 

Now FIPB either issue an approval to Enron LLC or advise us to avail 
automatic route. We will have one of it, culminating great team work.

Seethayya

John,

Congratulations on a career move.

Yes, we were contacted regarding geophysical data gathering/transmission 
project.
We asked our geophysicists for help and are shooting for
a meeting on  Thursday to run our ideas by them.

Vince

consulting

Good Morning Vince:

1) We met with some geophysical data gathering/transmission people last 
week.  I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of 
the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data 
driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of 
broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.  

I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.  
Have they contacted you yet?

2) I'm converting to consultant - I've had a great year here but need to get 
back north more often (family).  I will be converting to consultant status 
starting next week.  Do not hesitate to call me if there is anything I can do 
for you or your team to help out.

Jeff,

We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the 
numbers you have 
requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on 
the power situation in India
published by The Financial Times. 

The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting 
millions of people.
One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due 
to  power
shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost 
of power produced
by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230 
million people.

The second article is Enron specific.

Vince

               
    
                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India 
                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By ANGUS DONALD

                     Tens of millions of people were left without electricity 
in northern India
                     yesterday after a power grid breakdown. 

                     Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and 
most parts of the
                     capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply 
expected to be restored
                     by the end of the day, according to power grid 
officials. 

                     The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(Assocham), a
                     leading business organisation, expressed "deep concern" 
and called for a
                     mechanism to prevent future disruption that could 
"cripple the economy". 

                     The power failure across eight Indian states, including 
New Delhi, disrupted
                     train services, water supplies and the telephone network 
and forced
                     hospitals to switch to emergency generators. 

                     The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides 
electricity for 226m
                     people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana, 
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
                     Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu 
and Kashmir. 

                     A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, 
India's most
                     populous state, caused an overload of power on other 
lines, which then
                     failed as well. 

                     Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals 
systems were
                     damaged. New Delhi international airport was also 
slightly affected before
                     its own power supply could be engaged. 

                     "We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is 
most likely to be a
                     technical failure, but we will investigate why it 
happened," Suresh Prabhu,
                     the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust 
of India. 

                     India suffers regularly from power problems because of 
lack of funding to
                     upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big 
problem. Thirty per
                     cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according 
to analysts. In New
                     Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen. 

                     Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh 
and Delhi for
                     hours. 

                     Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing 
industrial demand
                     would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's 
inefficient power
                     sector. "The slow progress, particularly in 
strengthening the transmission
                     and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will 
contribute to
                     worsening the power supply situation further."

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Energy group launches image offensive: 
Enron has a
                     plan to reverse its reputation as a profiteering 
multinational
                     operating in India, writes Khozem Merchant 

                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By KHOZEM MERCHANT

                     Enron, the US energy producer and a constant target of 
criticism in India, is
                     hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a 
profiteering
                     multinational. 

                     Its "myth and reality" offensive in local newspapers 
follows the west Indian
                     state of Maharashtra's decision to review the tariff it 
pays the Texas-based
                     company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating 
plant at Dabhol is
                     India's biggest single foreign investment. 

                     Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993 
and is three times
                     greater than that charged by other independent power 
producers (IPPs).
                     The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the 
rupee against the
                     dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha 
fuel. The state also pays
                     a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, 
reflecting the
                     huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of 
consumption. 

                     A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six 
years ago that
                     damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former 
official of the World
                     Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is 
emerging "as the East
                     India Company of the 21st century" - a reference to the 
British trader that
                     colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th 
century. 

                     The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power 
sector. The UK's PowerGen
                     and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, 
frustrated by long approval
                     procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of 
higher
                     returns elsewhere. 

                     "India has lost time and opportunity and has driven 
returns down by six
                     percentage points," says Gerry Grove-White, former India 
general manager
                     of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat 
to China Light &
                     Power of Hong Kong. 

                     India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says 
generating capacity
                     must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 
1992, IPPs have
                     added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under 
construction. This is
                     insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 
per cent economic
                     growth. 

                     Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, 
winning fast-track project
                     approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant 
fuelled by expensive
                     naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a 
Dollars 1.87bn plant
                     of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied 
natural gas (LNG),
                     will be completed this year. Only two of seven other 
fast-track proposals
                     have achieved financial closure. 

                     From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating 
in Maharashtra's
                     then nationalist government cancelling the project 
before renegotiating
                     terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister 
of the successor
                     government, says the power purchase agreement is 
unaffordable. 

                     Enron, whose attackers also include cultural 
chauvinists, wants to maintain
                     good political relations in a hostile but lucrative 
environment. Enron views
                     India as a testing ground for its evolution from a 
traditional manager of
                     power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, 
such as energy, gas
                     and bandwidth. 

                     To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy 
between power
                     surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed 
this year. It is building
                     an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural 
gas. And it is
                     laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth 
space in a country
                     desperately short of this new economy commodity. 

                     In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight 
contract. It is supported by
                     many that believe any subversion of the contract would 
confirm investor
                     perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and 
industrial hub, as an
                     unreliable destination for investment. 

                     Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his 
predecessor, which
                     threatened to "dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea" - is 
under pressure from
                     radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options 
are limited.
                     Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an 
economically troubled state
                     that would have to compensate shareholders. 

                     Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility 
and Enron's main
                     client, is obliged to dispatch or "off-take" 90 per cent 
of Dabhol's output. Yet
                     MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take 
has averaged 60
                     per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has 
been paying a lot
                     more while consuming a lot less power. 

                     One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough 
new regulator has
                     told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the 
tariff would be
                     Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But 
with off-take a
                     third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and 
often higher. In
                     October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take 
was about 49 per
                     cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, 
run on cheaper
                     LNG, starts. 

                     These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only 
half of a 30 per
                     cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the 
balance and
                     mandated bankers to find a buyer. 

                     Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, 
which have failed to
                     deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared 
they would never be
                     paid by state generating boards that have become a 
byword for corrupt
                     management of power. 

                     Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic 
pricing means
                     industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as 
transmission and
                     distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and 
technical losses, is
                     overdue. "Given the limited resources, money would be 
better spent on T&D
                     rather than on new plant," says Oliver Blackaby, 
managing director of N M
                     Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the 
privatisation of its
                     distribution network. 

                     For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to 
satisfy the
                     competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay 
Bhatnagar, chief
                     executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade 
magazine, one of the
                     key lessons learned from phase 2 is "having flexibility 
to deal with
                     externalities".

Maureen,

Hope  all is well .Thank you for your coverage last week. I certainly 
appreciate the value-added that you provide in your research.I had a quick 
question for you regarding any anticipated Japan central bank intervention at 
the 15,000 level in the Nikkei.
If I am understanding the mechanism correctly, BIS reserve requirements fall 
below certain threshold and banks can no longer lend money and meet BIS 
lending criteria due to improper reserve base. And this roughly happens at 
15,000 level?

Reason I ask is Goldman Sachs put out an article suggesting that 
break-evenpoint for bank holding of stocks is roughly 12,000-12,500 a 
different index level than the one you have mentioned. 


I can appreciate the difference between reserve liquidity and actual 
break-even on equity positions, but just wanted to clarify this point with 
you, as we are trying to gain a complete understanding of how a trigger would 
effect Japanese capital markets. And so, as I currently understand it, there 
are (2 ) trigger levels to watch:

15,000 where banks fail BIS criteria and hence cannot extend new loans with 
BIS stamp of approval. Clearly ctl bank would have incentive in restoring 
this or else financial system would be thrown into turmoil.

12500 where banks begin to take an actual loss on equity holdings

Is this right?



Thanks Maureen, take care,
Darren

Subject: Improving option valuation precision in ERMS

Allan,

Paulo Issler in our group, working with Eric Moon in structuring, recently 
tracked down the reason for a slight mis-match in option pricing in ERMS vs. 
the structuring spreadsheets.  It is due to the fact that the option 
valuation functions in ERMS use a slightly less accurate approximation for 
the cumulative normal distribution.  We would be happy to work with the right 
person to update the ERMS code in order to close this discrepancy.   Please 
let me know how you would like to proceed.

If you are not the correct person to address the mainenance of ERMS, please 
let me know who to contact.

Thank you,

Stinson Gibner

Hi Bob,

some comments :
1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights.
2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.  This again mainly applies to limit orders, as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution (something to check).

Vince/Stinson,

Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as 
well as the revised statement that can be made to press.

The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of 
the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the 
gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating 
in homes, and commercial establishments.

Hope ths helps.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Vince,

I'd like to get someone to sit with one of team for a couple of days.... To 
help with reviewing code.

There seems to be two view of how this is currently working.

Your team seems to think Winston group is not being co-operative enough.

Winston's team seems to think they are co-operating...

I'd like to resolve this.

If my suggestion above doesn't work (putting some in your team for a couple 
of days) , I would like for us to sit down with Winston, Nilay and Tanya and 
try to work out what's happening.



Regards

Steve

The review of Eric Groves' LNG Model spreadsheet has been completed.  No 
independent model was available for use in the comparison; however, the model 
appears complete and accurate in representating all important cost and 
revenue elements.

If this financial model is coupled with a optimization model for planning 
ship usage in the future, additional variables may be needed to represent the 
variability of trip times, weather factors, etc.  A reference describing 
these possible additions was provided.

Stinson and Vince,

Please see Wade's comments below.  It is critical that we start the exercise 
quickly, and as metioned, it should be structured so that DPC foot the bill.

Also, as mentioned, please have them desist from using the word viability 
with reference to Dabhol.

Thanks Sandeep. Engagement needs to be structured so that DPC will pay for 
this key study. Have them address the study to DPC and invoice DPC. 

Second, on the cover, the reference is to "...... and Dabhol Plant 
Viability." Please instruct them to immediately cease discussions about and 
use of term Dabhol viability. They can use the term they use later on, which 
is Dabhol Plant Operations.

I sent you an email a couple of days ago to inquire if we might get together
at your offices on July 5 or July 7 in Houston to follow up our earlier
discussions.  I notice I have two email addresses for you, so I am sending
this to both.  I am not sure the earlier transmission got to you.

Would you be available the afternoon of the 5th or the morning of the 7th to
continue our earlier discussions?  Give me an email or phone shout at

I trust things are well in Houston.

The reason for contacting you is to inquire as to your schedule during the 
week
commencing Monday 18th September.   I and several of my colleagues would very
much like to meet up with you, however, we are tied up at a large conference
between Tuesday through to Friday of that week.

Is there any chance in meeting with you on Monday 18th?  If so, I will brief 
you
more fully on our people and will contact you to discuss an agenda.

Regards, ALLAN

Subject: UK RAB Multiples

I talked with Keith Harris, our CFO at Wessex, about the RAB multiple graph I 
gave you.  He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and 
that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but 
very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of 
100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB 
multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down 
by 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer 
to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keith 
if he has not yet contact you.

John:

Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed 
jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and 
semis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a 
simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average. 

The results show a good R-square between the general index and individual 
jackup categories - on the range of 0.7 - 0.8. Only one category displayed a 
poor R-square - about 0.3. For semis of 4tht and 5th generation, however, we 
noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - R-squares about 0.2 - 0.3. 
You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (AX2 on Analysis). 

Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages, 
12 month swaps on gas / crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates. 
We will forward the results as soon as we finish. 



Please call me or Claudio if you have questions.

Ken of RDI and I have gone through his model together and I have a clear idea
of how it's going step by step. I believe we can almost start recoding now. 

I need a C programmer who's familiar with Access data base.
I.e., he (or she) knows how to extract data from an Access data table (of
certain format) and output the results into an Access data table of certain
format.  Once the programmer is assigned, I will go through the model
with him and incorporate his ideas and Ken's, then we can start coding.

Vince,

I must apologize.  I have not had time to look over the proposal in any 
detail.  When I first spoke with your friend, it was apparent that he was 
still pre-business plan stage.  He has since sent me some ideas and 
information.  I think the concept has merit, but there are so many political 
issues that I am concerned about the ultimate business viability. 

Give me the weekend to look over the information.

Thanks,
Mark

Vince:

   As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then
about CDS,
the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest
privately owned
manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing 
its
finances,
so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual
revenue and
to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the
business of
manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))
food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other
products.

Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that
emphasizes the
long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win
solutions with
its suppliers, customers and partners.

As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its
expenses
goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of
researching
those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand
(people
eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).

CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very
successful,
with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in
these arenas.
CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports 
the
purchasing
function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a
multidiscipline and
multinational team with a lot to offer.

Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based
on
manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in 
this
area.
Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to
talk to.

In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to
anything
at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to
pursue the opportunity
we discussed in the future.

I am looking forward to our video conference call.

Kind regards,

Avi

Tracy,

Attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both Black-Scholes and 
American option valuation models.   These are the generally accepted methods 
for valuation of options on equity.   The "European" option prices assume 
that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity, while the 
"American" style options can be exercised at any time during their life.   

I have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market 
value of $13.00 and that the options are struck at this level.   The 
volatility input is the other main assumption.   EOTT has been trading 
recently with a volatility ranging between 30% to 40% although looking 
further back, the range is much wider.

To run the model, you must be linked with the options library.   I am not 
sure what lan you are connected with, but you can coordinate with Zimin Lu 
(x36388) for help with loading the option library add-in module.   On the ENA 
lan it is located under  O:\research\exotica\xll\exotica.xll.    This is 
loaded in excel using the Tools/Add-Ins and Browse to reach the add-in 
location.

--Stinson
x34748



P.S.   I will mail you a hard-copy of a plot showing recent EOTT volatility 
as well.   If you would like us to help you in running specific examples, 
please let me, Vince, or Zimin know.

Can we think about later this week? I promise it will be worth it to you. The

Bob,

Please find the price sample simulator, and run different scenarios with
different trend assumptions.


Vince and Stinson,

Bob and I will show you some results by the end of the day.

Vince,

A quick project update.

1.   Sandeep and I spoke with  Robert Schenck in Adelaide.   He will email a 
Henwood proposal to us.  They already figured that we must be interested in 
modelling Dabhol.
2.  The WTI EOL trading simulation had an error.   We were counting a 
mid-offer spread profit on each trade, but we actually would make the spread 
on each round-trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close).    I 
modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to Greg Whalley (he is the 
one who caught the mistake, so there goes my bonus for the year.) and John 
Lavorato.   I should probably re-run the earning volatility numbers, and 
update Ted Murphy as well.

I suspect that Enron India LLC would be the entity to use.  However, is 
anyone from Tax involved in this?  If not, we need to get someone in the 
loop.

Stinson,

Please find attached a revised version of the draft Consulting Agreement with 
Henwood.  FYI, I am attaching both a clean version and one marked toshow 
changes from the last draft I sent you.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions or comments on the agreement or the most recent changes.  

 

WHat is the status of Henwood?  Do you still want to engage them and what is 
the timeframe for their work (the dates in the draft may need to be 
corrected). 

Bruce and Lauren:  please advise on which Enron entity should be the party to 
this Consulting Agreement.

Thanks, Bonnie

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the 
documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this 
almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on 
Exotica documentation ?

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" 
parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating

He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see 
the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new 
input parameter 'Sig' is.

Vince and Stinson,

We met Bill Bradford yesterday, the credit model modification turns out to be 
three projects.

1) Potential exposure calculator
   
   This requres forward curves simulation and revaluation of all deals over 
the tenor (typically 20 years).
   It needs multi-factor HJM and gas-electricity joint factors of loading.  
Output from this model is the maximal loss amount and
   its confidence interval.
 
   Expected delivery time: 1 month

2) Include Asian option model into the current XLL calculation engine.

    This is more concrete and simly to do.

    Expected delivery time: 2 weeks.

3) Incorporate Krishna's "EAM" option valuation into the credit model

    This one is not yet urgent.


I may need more resources to accomplish these tasks.   Paulo has difficulty 
to commit himself to even to the second task, 
citing that he has other things to do.  Therefore I need your help in setting 
the prorities. 


Thanks,


Zimin

Subject: Hello from Chicago

Hey guys, I just wanted to update everybody on what's going on up here in 
Chicago.  We've finally got our computers hooked up, so we are off and 
running now.  Actually, we got quite of few projects going on up here (yes, 
these are real projects) and we are going to need the Houston Structuring 
group for support.  I don't know if you guys are still short-handed and what 
kind of projects you may already have lined-up, but I wanted list out some of 
the projects that we are currently working on.

GAS

LRG project -  Deirde is currently working on this with Russell

NSS storage - Sean Boyle helped value both their current and new NSS.  We are 
currently working on negotiating with People's for these, and I expect that 
there may be additional requests in the future.

Manlove Summer Withdraw program - Yes this is not a typo.  Surprise, 
Surprise... Manlove can do a lot more than we thought.  I've talked to 
Deirdre about it and created a simple model, but I would like to better 
analyze this with your help.

Capital Improvements - We've got People's Christmas list of capital projects 
that we are going to help them analyze and seek if any of these make sense.

Sendout model - We would like to help them better optimize their morning 
sendout taking into account current market pricing and the Enron supply deal.

PBR - We are not sure when or if  People's will file a PBR, but I think that 
there are a lot of things that we learned during our previous experience that 
we can do to help them prepare for a competitive marketplace (ie transport 
customers tariff restructuring)

PESC - People's is looking for assistance in understanding load following and 
helping them build models to optimize their retail gas effort

San Juan pricing - Evan has been working with the Desk to provide indicative 
pricing with regard to PEC hedging out some of their San Juan production 
reserves

Power

Power project development - we have several power projects underway and the 
CTG group (Billy Lemmons) is helping us create necessary models 

PESC - the retail power stuff lives.  I've think that Fallon has a new 
attitude on these deals and Enron has committed to help them figure out this 
market.

Power plant balancing model - we have in our portfolio and will be offering 
balancing/storage services for Chicago area power projects.  We would like to 
have a model or at least a better understanding to help us with this endeavor.


We have resources in Chicago dedicated to these projects, as well as the 
other stuff we're trying to do like negotiate contracts and set up the 
Chicago back office function.  We plan on adding our own structuring 
resources (in Chicago or Houston), but we felt that we ought to start by 
figuring out what support the Houston office will be able to provide.  I will 
be in the office this Monday (Jan 17), so I hope to be able to catch up with 
you and discuss some of these items then.  Feel free to contact me if you 
need to before then at 312.357.8876 or pager 800.778.0291.  Thanks

Richard

Stinson,

I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is 
large
and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
those trade earning the half of BO spread. 

I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we 
are 
ready to deliever the model V.1.

Vince-

Here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church.

First off, it appears from the data that a special "appeal" for fund giving 
was made (from the pulpit?) on April 19, 1998 and April 25, 1999, (perhaps 
tied rhetorically into Income Taxes?). Then, by going back and incorporating 
obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression 
analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:

giving this Sunday = $4403

+ a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since 
Jan. 5, 1997)

+ no pure effect from last week's contributions (i.e., denies first-order 
autoregressive effects)

+ $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas

+ $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999

- $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday

- $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving

- $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)

The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3 
years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for 
2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.

Thanks a lot for a very quick response. It looks fine.

Please, forward it to Margaret Carson. Please, explain the data source. She
may expect NYMEX as the data source for natgas and WTI.

Cecil,
I've spoken with Charlene just now and she sounds very helpful. 
Can you give her a call tomorrow morning to iron out exactly how
you want to access the Enpower Data base? I've left your name
with her so she's expecting your call. 

Best,
Alex

Michelle,

The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker,
5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.

I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level
of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable
time.

We are working on a project to model the economic viability of Dabhol under

Hi Vince,

 Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for 
each region from David Hoog's Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they 
explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy David's 
outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve 
to mark the non-firm position.
 My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but 
it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they 
have put the ball in David Hoog's court to build the curve if David wants to 
sell his product internally to the desk.  
 Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define "non-firm"?  
The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific 
generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of David's 
outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of 
non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to 
give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem 
anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a 
unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.  
Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the "non-firm curve for the 
region"?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or 
group of units.

Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.

Thanks,
 
Vasant

Dear Vince, 

Hi, I hope your having fun on you vacation!  I just want to drop you a line 
since we haven't talked in a while and give you a progress update.  First, I 
feeling much better.  Eventhough I was out last week, I finished the 
following curves:  

Canadian CPI
Phillippines FX and CPI
Mexican FX and CPI
Saudi Arabian FX and CPI
Guatemalan FX

We also helped London RAC with finding information on the UK inflation model 
to backtest it.  Gwyn and Yana kept me very busy last week.  Yana, who lives 
close by me was nice enough to drop off work at night.  Gywn and I worked on 
the curves over the phone.


Yesterday, I got a call from Terry Thorn, he needed economic information and 
a presentation to give to EGM management.  I gave him a copy of the 
conforming assets presentation, he was very pleased.  This week, I'm working 
on a urgent request from RAC.  The board has decided to resurrect Dragon 2, 
so we are preparing all the curves for the APACHI region.  I'm also working 
on the metals presentation.  See you Thursday.


Regards,


Maureen

HI Iris:

May 17th is fine.  He will probably need to come in the night before (the 
16th)
and he can make a hotel reservation at the Doubletree or the Hyatt and tell
them he is a guest of Enron and he will get a corporate rate.  We will 
reimburse 
him for room expense only.  He will need to pick up any miscellaneous room 
charges.   We will also reimburse him for his flight expense and cab fare.
The Doubletree Telephone # is:  713-759-0202 and the Hyatt Telephone is:
713-654-1234.

He can either leave his receipts with me when he is here or mail them
to me and I will have a check cut.  I will need his SS#.

If you have any more questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Michelle,
Chris, Helen and I met this afternoon and discussed about
the project.  We think the following course of action is appropriate.
The model interface will be in Excel Spreadsheet, with most
of the inputs (from Enron as well as from the consultant) hiding
in an Access data base. The Access data base can be update
when needed. The engine will be written in Visual Basis code and
be linked to Excel through xll (or dll). 

Helen has been discussing with Ken about various
aspects of the model and will finalize the Access data table
form with Ken. In the mean time, Helen and I will start working
on code this Thursday (she will be in training Wednesday). 

Best,
Alex

All:
Ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many P&L's as need the 
report, minimizing everyone's cost by sharing a single subscription. 
Please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so, the RC 
code & co# for me to allocate your cost share.  Please indicate your choice 
of the three cost choices.

Attached note below clarifies Poten's proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription.
Essentially we have three choices:
1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly 
"special feature" article)
2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly 
"special feature" article, as in three attached examples)
3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for 
36 months.

Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No 
one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an 
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to 
others in the corporation.
The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles:
99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean
99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere
99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile
One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.  Some may 
be useless, others perhaps quite valuable.  Your call. 

regards
Guy

Dear Guy,

It was a pleasure speaking to you today.

As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part
fuel-oil related service:

(1) a one-year subscription to Poten's Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium
Edition), and

(2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest
Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S
FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would
be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price
projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be
accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over
the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.

The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal
installments

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Larry

Subject: Poten's Fuel Oil Report

Niamh & Doug & Margaret:
I want to chat about this and will call you, but the essence is:

Can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to Poten's Monthly Fuel Oil 
Report? 
Attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month 
price forecasts.  The cost is $3800/yr.
As an added service for a total of $10,000/yr, Poten will include a quarterly 
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and FO prices with a brief 
justification for their view.  This would include the standard monthly price 
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24 
months for Far East, Med and NWE.  (I expect a more descriptive email from 
Poten, but I think this is the essence of their "custom" offer.)

The example copies attached include the following Special Features:
99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean
99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere
99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile
These type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects 
related to fuel oil.

I have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price 
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself 
regarding the utility of such a report.  The best way to show your 
recommendation is with money.  If it is not worth any money to anyone else in 
ENE, then I have to question its validity and utility to me as well.  Doug, 
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure 
to FO prices?

best regards
Guy

I will not be able to attend the meeting. Here are some updates:

1) I left a message to George Posey, I will follow up tomorrow (Tuesday),
2) I will follow up on the Credit Reserve issue ASAP, I will find out what the
present state of the models are and come up with modification requirements
to accomodate asset related projects.
3) This week I will need to spend much of my time in meeting with the 
breakthrough

We've had a request from AA to provide them with some sort of write-up or documentation from our research group on the valuation methodology used on the contingent issuance instrument for 18 million shares that was a part of the Raptor transaction completed at the end of March.  Apparently, this request has come from AA's expert in this area (I believe that his name is Dechundra, or something like that.  I've probably destroyed the spelling on that.  You guys are probably very familiar with him.)  Anyway, is there such documentation that we can provide them easily?  If so, let me know so that we can try to get AA finished with their review of the transaction.  In talking to our contacts at AA, I believe that their expert will be wanting to talk to you after he reviews the methodology documentation.  Thanks,
Ron

Speaking from experience, I think that it's critical for Tanya and Anjam to 
visit MG in New York
and establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk 
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions 
between IT and quants
 will be very helpful.

I think most of your queries can be dealt with on the phone - I'll be at MG

been covered with Anjam in any case.  I'm also attaching a file downloaded 
from Mercur (MG's risk aggregation system) showing monthly total positions 
for each metal in each entity.  You can fairly easily create tables and graph 
what you want to see.  We can talk today about getting a full deal download.

curves;
2. Information on exotic options structures (existing & potential);
3. The data flow (are we going to get data from London or NY).
4a. Storage of positions information at  MG. How to extract the positions 
info from
MG database into spreadsheets.
4b. Existing positions structure for each metal.
5. Introduction to concentrates trading business, key personnel.

Vince & Stinson,

The number comes out from the time series model is 42,  compared with Mike's 
61.

Last  year's number (true) was 41 (7/23/99), and 26 (7/30/99).  Therefore the 
curve is down-sloping dramatically.

Let us see  what happen tomorrow.

Marc and I spoke about the JCC Brent relationship. I don't know enough about 
JCC to have a view if putting JCC on EOL is a good idea. Would be interested 
to know the realtionship to Brent and learn more about it. Also spoke to John 
Chismar about JCC. It sounds pretty non-liquid acc. to John.

Let me know if there is something we can do.

Chris,

Thanks for the response. The comment about hedgeing JCC with Brent is right 
on if the exercise is to hedge our own LNG positions that we have tieds to 
JCC. Note that the high JCC correlation to Prompt Brent is not something that 
is obvious to non-Enron LNG-tied-to-JCC buyers. If you are an LNG-tied-to-JCC 
buyer, and you wish to hedge your purchases, wouldn't you want to be able to 
transact ona a JCC contract? My objective is to have a JCC contract on EOL, 
whereby we, Enron, take the JCC/Brent risk (which is why we asked Vince 
Kaminski's group to study the relationship and give us a hedge ratio to use). 
I'm attaching a model used to calculate JCC for Dabhol Power Co.'s Adgas and 
Oman LNG contracts. Basically what happens is that all the "raw oil" volumes 
imported into Japan and added up and the total price is divide by the total 
volume, and there is a Yen/US$ foreighn exchange component as well. That is 
JCC. It was designed by the Japanese so that they could tie their LNG imports 
to their average price of crude imports whereby the LNG would be cheaper on 
an MMBTU basis.

Comments?

Brgds,

Marc

regarding putting JCC on EOL I get a negative respons from our Sing office. 
It is not a very liquid market. Everyone is going the same way.
I understand there is good correlation between Brent and JCC. I know little 
about JCC, but if there is good correlation u should be able to hedge 
yourself with Brent. I need to know more about how JCC works in order to help 
u, if u require any help at all?

Chris,

Some of EGM's LNG Group's LNG is priced using a JCC-based formula. There's 
also a lot of other LNG contracts that use JCC as the pricing basis. In June 
we obtained sign-off from Vince Kaminski's group to hedge JCC using Prompt 
Brent (see the messages with the relevant hedge ratio below). Can we set up a 
contract on EOL, using the Prompt Brent-JCC hedge ratio, to hedge JCC? 

FYI, on a BTU conversion basis:


Therefore, to hedge 1000 MT of LNG, a customer would need to transact on a 
hedge for 9000 BBL of JCC. Can we list a JCC swap in 9000 BBL/month 
increments?

Thanks in advance,

Marc

Thanks for the information. For avoidance of doubt, please confirm:

That the  relationship means that to hedge ten thousand barrels of JCC in 
September '00, I would have to enter into a financial transaction for 6706 
barrels of Prompt (August) Brent, and;

That this email constitutes your groups (Vince Kaminski's) sign-off on using

Thanks for your help in this matter.  I dont want to be a bother to you.  I
know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between.

As you might suspect, I am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at
Enron because MarketPoint is just now being completed--U.S. and world oil
and gas and North American electricity.  We have just signed up our first
web provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American
electric generation data base over their website.  I believe we are an
integral part of their offering.  It wont be long before MarketPoint needs
the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
or offer fundamental forward projections from our models.  I a loath to do
so without the capitalization and staffing we need.  Also, I am loath to do
so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly
available.

I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the
discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly.
I plan to be there the last week in June.

Thanks again for all your help and support.

Dale

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

>From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Vince:

Thanks very much for your interest in our MarketPoint product, and thanks
for the hour you gave me this morning.  As promised, I am enclosing our
executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take
forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment
collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead
investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron
wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we
need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading
companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and
then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware
you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest
with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with
non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider
partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this
arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very
attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays,
and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move
forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks
again and best regards.

Dale Nesbitt

PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.  I spoke with
him after speaking with you about many of the same issues.

Kevin,

Thanks for the information. For avoidance of doubt, please confirm:

That the  relationship means that to hedge ten thousand barrels of JCC in 
September '00, I would have to enter into a financial transaction for 6706 
barrels of Prompt (August) Brent, and;

That this email constitutes your groups (Vince Kaminski's) sign-off on using 
this hedge ratio to hedge JCC and JCC-based products?

Thanks in advance,

Marc de La Roche

		 Subject: Seismic Data on Oil & Gas field Development via Satellite

Mike,

Using NASA satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a Houston 
Data Center to consolidate and centrally process 3D seismic data surveys for 
oil and gas extraction, exploration and development could save the petroleum 
industry more than $300 million dollars annually through reduced operational 
expenses.  Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the 
finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon 
$15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner)in 
revenue.  By re-selling this data to market analysts or by internally using 
this data for forecasting future oil/gas production Enron could increase the 
accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally.  By 
holding the data as exclusive (or partially exclusive), Enron would have a 
significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas.(Vince's team 
is quantifying the valuation of this information)

Attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data 
transfer via satellite, by a geophysicist at SpaceData - William K. Aylor, 
calculated using $22/barrel oil.

Based upon your availability, Jon Adler and I would like to make a 
presentation to you (or your designated representative) on the Enron 
potential of this opportunity, sometime next week (17-20 October).

Vince,

Good to hear from you and I'm glad you're available. How is Wednesday at
2:30?

I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to
say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because
of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman,
Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk
about a shotgun marriage!

If we have time next week, I could step you through our website --
www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art
WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for
PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity
judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the
results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).

Have a great weekend.

Ed

I have a copy of the article.
I agree with you. The model is
essentially the same (in intentions).

I shall distributed the copy of the paper
to the trades here. It explains  
well the logic behind the model and it's
an independent source.

Vince, 

I got the article.  I can make a copy for you when I get back.
The article is pretty much for marketing purpose.   My reading
from that paper is as follows:

1. solve optimal exercise bounday using stocastic DP;
2. runing price trajectory to tracking storage level to give average storage 
cycling;

Our model addresses the same issues,  althrough maybe the implementation is
not quite the same. 

I will fax to you if I can find the article here.

Hi Vince:

Number one below is fine...the more accurate the EBITDA model the better.  
Your "tweaking" of the model at this point won't create any Chinese Wall 
problems.

Michelle and Gary will talk about the programmer issue on Monday, and get 
back to you.  I apologize if there was any confusion.  We're certainly 
grateful for Alex's involvement.

Today is my last day of Associate rotation within the Financial Trading 
group, and I start at EES on Monday.  I handed off the project as best I 
could, and of course will be available if you need me.  My e-mail and phone 
number will be the same.

Have a nice weekend.

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.

Vince,

Here is a brief about the project with Maria Garcia.

Promigas, in partnership with others,  wants to acquire $80 MM TVCable 
company in Mexico.
Promigas's ownership would be 25%, i.e. , 20MM.  10MM of it would come from 
debt.
Enron wants to participate this deal by offer Promigas loan guarantee in 
exchange of call options
on 50% Promigas equity in TVCable.

Following suggestions have been made:

1) get a market quote for the loan guarantee;
    use credit risk model to price the guarantee internally;
    need to speak to Vasant

2) find a comparable company, study the volatility
    using company value histogram from economics model(crystal ball output), 
I can fit a lognormal
    distribution, then find the volatility

3)calcalte the call option value, find braek-even strike.


Any inputs are extremely welcome.

Zimin

Margaret,

I have an economist in my group and asked her if she feels qualified to make a
presentation on this topic. I shall keep you posted. I think It would help
Enron to oblige.

Subject: Speakers for a CEO Meeting with Governor Johanns

Hello Margaret.  We are looking for a speaker for a meeting that is being 
arranged with Nebraska Governor Johanns during the first week in April.

The potential topic is a national perspective on pricing pressures/trends on 
natural gas, electricity and oil and their impact on agricultural production 
costs, as well as types of risk managment tools that are being used to offset 
the price fluctuations.

Do you know of anyone, either within the Corporation or outside, who would be 
available to travel to Omaha to make this presentation?  

I would appreciate any assistance that you could provide, Margaret.

Thanks, 

beth jensen

Cecil,
I've spoken with Charlene just now and she sounds very helpful. 
Can you give her a call tomorrow morning to iron out exactly how
you want to access the Enpower Data base? I've left your name
with her so she's expecting your call. 

Best,

Michelle,

The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker,
5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.

I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level
of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable

George is fully enthusiastic for a seminar by Research on these ideas and 
resource tools. Any afternoon is fine to him- we can probably push the time 
up to 3:00 or so so everyone who needs to cheat to get away from work early

Allan,

Paulo Issler in our group, working with Eric Moon in structuring, recently 
tracked down the reason for a slight mis-match in option pricing in ERMS vs. 
the structuring spreadsheets.  It is due to the fact that the option 
valuation functions in ERMS use a slightly less accurate approximation for 
the cumulative normal distribution.  We would be happy to work with the right 
person to update the ERMS code in order to close this discrepancy.   Please 
let me know how you would like to proceed.

If you are not the correct person to address the mainenance of ERMS, please 
let me know who to contact.

Thank you,

Stinson Gibner

   Hi again,


        I had lunch today with some of the guys in my group who work on
   agriculture-related deals and on weather derivatives.

        I mentioned to them about Bernard's working at McKinsey and
   specializing in the agriculture area.

        We thought it might be worthwhile if we all had a chat and/or met
   to discuss possible collaborative efforts.

        Will you please forward this email on to Bernard to see if this
   might be of interest to him?


   Thanks,
   Iris

Andrea,

We computed the HC historical volatility for last 3 years, it is 47.2%.

Using this volatility, the costless collar call strike is at 83.32.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

>From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Amy:

Below are the individuals Vince wants to include in this meeting.  Do you
want me to send the email out or is it better coming from you?  I have
reserved EB19C1, however, since most of the guys are located on an
upper floor we may want to see if we can get something up there.

Let me know.

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for Enron's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have Enron participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,

Brad,

With your success in automation of the testing, we can go ahead to test 
storage cycles as follows

April 95 - March 96
April 96 - March 97
April 97 - March 98
April 98 - March 99
April 99 - March 00

This way we can collect 5 years data for further analysis.

Zimin, thanks for the meeting yesterday, your help is going to be very 
valuable for the analysis of our deal.  

Below you will find the names of the comparable companies you can use for the 
study of the volatility:

Cablevision
Comcast
Cox Communications
MediaOne Group
Rogers Communications
Time Warner

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter published a memorandum on  January 5/00   "US 
Investment Research: Cable Television"  where you can get detailed 
information on the performance of these companies


We will be working on the histogram during the weekend and we will be sending 
the results to you as soon as possible.
Regarding the quotes for the loan guarantee we will be getting them on Monday.

Please let me know if you will need any  additional information for the 
volatility study


Thanks and Regards,  

Maria Elena

Vince:

Thanks very much for your interest in our MarketPoint product, and thanks
for the hour you gave me this morning.  As promised, I am enclosing our
executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take
forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment
collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead
investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron
wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we
need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading
companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and
then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware
you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest
with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with
non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider
partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this
arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very
attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays,
and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move
forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks
again and best regards.

Dale Nesbitt

PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.  I spoke with
him after speaking with you about many of the same issues.

Vince,

Since you are not here today, I just sent out the presentation of the model I 
prepared for John 
for his feedback.  I would appreciate that you review it before we make the 
final version. 

Obviously, this simulation model is going to make a big impact on our online 
trading.  And I am happy
that we have accomplished this task effciently and elegantly.

Subject: WTI trading simulation model - presentation



John,

I put together a presentation of the simulation model for WTI market maker 
for you. 
The P/L results are investigated by assuming different scenarios.

The key variable is the number of trade per day, therefore is varied  from 
200 to 1000 trades.

Scenarios are generated by different spreads, net open position allowed, and 
time period.

Take a look what I have prepared, and let me know things you want to add or 
delete.
If you have any questions, I will be happy to discuss with you.



Zimin

PS: this presentation is only for the open-close trading.  I will produce 
exact the same
sequence for the continuous trading (close-close) once you approve the 
content.

I am with the EBS Venture Capital group. We are looking at evaluating an

proposition involves certain patents on genetic programming. Are you familiar

Vince,

The Sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option 
to participate in building a wind farm. Should this proceed, we would like to 
mark this option "to market".

Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and 
remarking real options? Alternatively, do you have any suggestions as to the 
best way to value, and book, real options fairly?

Regards

Mike, 
Here is third version of the program. It gives better results than the 
previous versions you have. Sorry for the delay, these past 2 days I have 
been busy meeting with people on the new EBS project. I think the result 
looks reasonably good. You can try it. (To run, type cow filename.jpg m)

Folks,

I am forwarding this in order for the team to focus on the naphtha issue.  
Please note that:

As Phase II comes on line, Blocks B and C will first have to run on naphtha 
for a period of 3-6 months
This will hit us some time in 2001, hence is a more urgent issue than LNG, 
which is still a year away
If there are delays in the commissioning of the Regas terminal, the period on 
naphtha could further prolong
The naphtha market is more volatile than the crude market, and is not as 
deep, hence we need to take small positions early on to test the market
DPC Board has already approved a Risk Management Policy that allows for 
hedging.  We may need to look into options that are costless (selling put and 
buying call) to begin with, and test while only Block A is in place.
Close coordination will be required on this with the Global Markets group, 
and I propose someone like Anshuman should actually be seconded onto the group
A whole plan on tools to manage the fuel risk need to be worked in close 
coordination with the team on the ground

These are just some of my thoughts.  With 50% of the tariff being fuel price 
dependent, this is an area that requires close attention.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Subject: Naphtha hedge for 2001

Current level of naphtha prices and the crude futures curve being 
backwardated provide an opportune time for DPC to enter into a hedge for all 
or a portion of its naphtha requirements for the year 2001.  We (EFI) would 
like to explore this possibility before this situation passes.  Please 
advise.  Best regards,

Jim/Wade,

As you are aware, I have been working with Vince's group on the Henwood model 
data.  The target was to have data on all India plants collected by Jan. 15th.

We all know that getting power out o Maharashtra holds the key to being able 
to solve the Dabhol challenge.  With all of your help, this model can become 
the tool that tells us exactly how that can be done, and at what prices.

We are a substantial part of the way there on data collection, and have got 
data of some 1500 plants across the country.  The spreadsheet for the same is 
attached.  This will help you answer any questions that come up in calls 
about the various plants.  Please note that we are located in the Western 
Region, or WR in the spreadsheet.  We will be further scrubbing the data and 
getting more recent and accurate information, especially on Maharashtra over 
the next 2-3 days.  

The Henwood team will be in India on Sunday, and will compare notes with the 
team here.  I am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it will 
do.  

Wade - It would be good if a broad section of the team attend, including 
Neil, yourself and Mohan.  I will talk to you about a convenient time for you 
in this regard.

Neil & Mohan - Over the next week (Monday and Tuesday) I will need some time 
from Vivek, Anshuman, Ravi, and a few others, to interact with the Henwood 
team.  I will be abliged if you can make that possible.

The first phase of model runs (which will be done by Jan. end) will just give 
us some more basic information, but I will need all of your inputs in order 
to ask the right questions.  The idea is that as we go along, this model will 
be used to answer all types of management questions concerning Dabhol, and 
power evacuation out of Maharashtra.

This will be critical for the team going forward.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Lloyd,

Yes, this would be very useful. I was told that we should not do any official 
business with
MG until July 15. I don't want to violate those rules of engagement and go 
beyond casual contacts.
After the 15th all the stops are off.

I met Maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within 
Enron.  I think it would be very helpful to promote the Research group 
function of the company, particularly given Maureen's background,  if she 
could be introduced to some of the main traders down at MG.  Unfortunately 
she won't have time to meet with MG unless we can schedule some meetings on 
Monday.

Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till Monday to allow the 
meetings to take place?

Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson

Bill,
Attached are the spreadsheet for the Credit Exposure model and the XLL file.  
We have
performed some tests and the numbers looked reasonable. However, more 
extensive
testing using realistic data is needed. We would like to pass the model to 
you so you can
have someone check it more extensively and compare the model  with what you 
are using.
Also, please kindly inform me of any suggestions to improve the model as well 
as
any problems you may find. 

I can be reached at 31631. 
Best,
Alex

Fred, 

I have finished a model we talked about a few days ago.

The option we try to price is a digital on on an Asian Strip.
If the average price of the prompt month crude oil in a specified time window 
falls below the strike price, the option pays a lump sum of money secified by
the "digital payout" in the model.  

 As a comparison, I also included European option on the Asian Strip.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Vince,

Please find below a note I had prepared for Wade Cline who is meeting with a 
representative of the Prime Minister's office tomorrow.

I think you may find these points useful.

Additionally, I am attaching a copy of a small presentation I made, Saturday 
in Mumbai on roadblocks in the power sector with special reference to wat 
needs to be done to start Trading (& its benefits).

I have been working with the Henwood team that arrived today, and I think a 
good part of the data is now in place.  I will be arranging meeting with some 
officicals from the transmission side and gather any additional data there 
too.

Krishan got in last night (I conveyed your best wishes to him).  We will 
hopefully have a useful day with Henwood folks tomorrow.  I look forward to 
being in Houston, possibly by the end of the coming week.

Hope you and the team are doing well!!

Regards,
Sandeep.

Subject: Points for Singh Meet

Wade,

Please find below a brief note on what I feel your tack should be with 
N.K.Singh (who is supposed to be a hard negotiator).  I am assuming here that 
this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out 
the other.  The two meetings I had arranged over the weekend, would 
hopefully, have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two 
people o the issue.

Incidentally, in the Indian system, the Governor of any state is a Central 
government nominee.  He is the eyes and ears of the Central govt. in the 
state.  Please see Basak's meeting in that light.  The message he takes will 
likely go directly to the PMO in Delhi.  I will therefore be working closely 
to convey the right impression.

For N.K.Singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey:
A description of the problem, 
Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough, and
Conveying the fact that there are win-win solutions well within the GoI's 
power to implement, that would in fact enhance his reputation and the 
country's as one that lives up to its reputation

I would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any 
value, but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB, GoM, and GoI needs, either 
through financial re-engineering, or through getting direct access to the 
market in some areas.  This will also fly well with Enron management that is 
more comfortable with market risks than political.

Describing the Problem

DPC has a PPA, backed by GoI & GoM guarantees for one of the most high 
profile projects in the world 
(World's largest gas fired power plant, India's first LNG terminal, gateway 
to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India, development of 
Konkan)
With coming of Phase II (due end-2001) cost of power from Dabhol will be more 
competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant 
(low heat rates, larger turbines, spreading of infrastructure costs over a 
larger base, use of LNG as fuel)
(Our average tariff at 90% despatch is Rs. 4.02/kWh for Phase I.  This goes 
down to Rs. 3.30 - 3.70/kWh with coming in of Phase II.  Compare this with 
NTPC's own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs.3.32 - 4.01for same range 
of crude prices ($21-28/barrel).  Hence DPC power is competitive, our 
standards of performance are higher, penalties for non-performance are 
greater, and as a private player, our place in the waterfall seems to be 
lower (quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by 45-60 
days, MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments).
However, monthly outflows could be as much as Rs. 450 Cr./month; MSEB's 
monthy collections not improving - are in the range of Rs. 900 Cr./month 
 MSEB, and GoM clearly do not have the resources, in the short run (3-5 yrs.) 
to meet these obligations; hence Central intervention is needed.
In a grid of 13000 MW (Maharashtra grid size), absorbing an additional 1440 
MW (Phase II) at one go is difficult; however if we take Western Region, grid 
size is 42000 MW.  Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much 
easier.  
To this if we add Northern and Southern grids, we can probably evacuate out 
another 500-700 MW through the interconnects.  Hence, there is definitely 
value in looking at this issue at a national level.
Additionally, it is not just solvable at that level, but actually answers to 
the crying need for power in the country, and hence is a boon for the govt., 
and should be treated as such.

Consequences of Not Solving the Problem
We can call upon the sovereign guarantee, which will cover our partial 
payments.  However, this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of 
the country's credit rating - put back incoming investments into the 
Petroleum sector (where private participation program is about to be unveiled 
in 25 O&G blocks), telecom sector (where a new policy has been announced 
months ago, and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing).
It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks, 
including export credit agencies of US, Japan, and Belgium (an EEC member).
It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks (Indian lenders to 
the project include IDBI, ICICI, SBI, to metion just a few)
Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector, where there 
is urgent need for funding (especially te new initiatives in transmission)
There is a timeline for solving this, since our project is coming before 
year-end 2001, and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take 
place at the SEB and state level. 

Win-Win Solutions Exist
Northern region is power starved, south needs power badly.  Hence it is a 
boon to have this power made available in the timeframe.  With Central govt. 
intevention, it is possible to solve th problem to everyone's mutual benefit.
1440 MW (incremental Phase II) is only 3.4% of the capacity existing in the 
Western Region, and can be easily absorbed.
Win-Win Solutions exist by:
Restructuring some of the guarantees
Adding some central govt entity (including those from the petroleum sector - 
IOC or GAIL, interested due to LNG trml.) to the equity mix at par
Back-ending tariff and other financial re-engineering solutions that could 
involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt. et. etc.

Bottom Line: 
Time is of essence; we need to get someone to negotiate with.  Please use 
your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes 
Central, State govt., and SEB representatives so that we can work on the 
solution.
Without active participation from PM's office, we are likely to waste 
precious time bouncing between the SEB, GoM, and various Ministries of GoI.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
Sandeep.

      Hi again,


           I had lunch today with some of the guys in my group who work on
      agriculture-related deals and on weather derivatives.

           I mentioned to them about Bernard's working at McKinsey and
      specializing in the agriculture area.

           We thought it might be worthwhile if we all had a chat and/or
   met
      to discuss possible collaborative efforts.

           Will you please forward this email on to Bernard to see if this
      might be of interest to him?


      Thanks,
      Iris

I am preparing a summary or our Thursday discussions to be used as a 
background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders.  I will 
circulate this for review/correction later today, or ,at the latest, Monday.

Greg, you mentioned that Enron had participated in a speculative survey in 
the Gulf of Mexico that was successful.  It might be useful to get more info 
on this.  Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not 
continued to do this, etc.

Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3-D surveys are in deep 
water.  I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep sea 
drilling/extraction project in the Gulf.  What oil price is required to make 
these kinds of projects viable financially?

Vasant,
Vince and I spoke with Gary Hickerson and Michelle Cisneros about the
consultant's power plant model this afternoon. We will take their model's
interface and recode the calculation engine, incorporating useful insights
from the consultant. IT help will be available
via Gary's group.  So I will spend the next 4 weeks working on this.

Michelle,
I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not
realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and
run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results.
This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like
we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but 
does not solve the problem. 

In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is optimal.
I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C,
but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Best,
Alex

Subject:	Generation Earnings Model

Hi Alex-

Danielle and I were talking to David M. today regarding running the model for purposes of back testing the results. Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations. 

We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process?

Thanks,
Michelle

Stinson, 

Henwood can help us with the project in our time frame (end of January). The 
Henwood person who will coordinate the project is David Branchcomb, located 
in London. He will have to involve the Henwood ?manager for Asia, who works 
out of Australia. 

I told him that you would call him Wednesday morning on his cell phone to set 
up a conference call later the same day with the guy in Australia. Given time 
difference it may happen late afternoon. 

They expect that we shall give them the specs of the project. It makes sense 
to involve Sandeep at the conference call: he will be very specific about our 
needs. I sent you his coordinates in an earlier message. Sandeep may have to 
come to the office: I don't know if Anita knows how to set up a conference 
call. 

David's phone numbers: 

44 207 242 8950 
44 787 942 5375 (cell). 

I may be at the office in the morning for an hour or two. 

Vince

Hi Vince,

Thank you for sending me the email from Don Reid regarding the Turkey FX and 
CPI curve.  I received the same email last week and the request has been 
taken care of.  In fact, he had a very short time line for the request  and 
had subsequently used outside forecasts for the bid.  If the deal goes 
through RAC, I'm sure we'll get another request for the curve, but for now, 
Don said that he doesn't need a forecast from us.  

Regards,

Farouk Z. Lalji

Stinson,

I am trying to contact our data base experts at the moment to clarify some
issues with the region and may need another day to get something more
concrete in front of you.

What I would like to know is the extent of your company knowledge re the
following

Generation units' nameplate capacity, fuel type, efficiency, O&M costs, fuel
costs
Location of generation units
details of HV interconnectors between regions which have individual load
forecasts (capacity in MW, losses)
Details of Hydro/pump storage location, capacity and Historical outputs

many thanks

Robert

 Hey Ding.  If you recall, we looked at Southern Cone during July, as this 
was the feedback that we got from our presentation in late May.  The Cuiaba 
gas and power volumes may be found in several different places since there is 
more than one model.  The models do not necessarily agree with each other.  I 
have attached a few models that should contain the necessary info.  I also 
have a summary sheet template that was to be attached in MAPS.  Enjoy.

-Kevin K.

Chaim,

I received a number of phone messages from you.
The project is now in the hands of John and I shall
be very happy to assist him when he is ready to move.
He is looking at the licensing agreement right now.

Till then, I have to wait for him to make  a decision.
My role in this project is one of a facilitator, technical
consultant.

Thanks so much for getting back to me.  We remain keenly interested in doing
the preliminary project for you so that you can know how MarketPoint works
and how it might help you.  We are ready to go on the test process as soon
as you and your people are ready.

You heard from Dr. Chaim Braun, Altos Vice President, who called you at my
request to inquire about your demonstration project.  I will mention to
Chaim that you expressed your interest via email to me.  There is no need to
phone him back until you are ready to go.  Chaim's email address is
chaim.braun@altosmgmt.com and he can be reached at the main Altos number
650.949.3541.  My personal phone number is 650.218.3069.

I look forward to working together.

Dale

Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your North American
Gas Model.  I am however still interested in setting up a test process to
familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.

I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in December
and will be back in touch soon.  I need to discuss this further with the
business segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on
the Long Term gas model.

Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced
his name and number.  I thought that an e-mail response would suffice for
now.  My apologies.

Regards,

John Goodpasture

Hi Steve,

I plan to spend next week building relatively simple long term (1-2 years) 
demand forecast - it will be a starting point and will allow our guys to work.

For more detailed analysis I will need more information, particularly on 
recent changes in demand in the Sates (California).
I tried to contact Vince, but probably he is very busy right now.

Please, could you help me to find somebody in the Houston who may provide any 
help.

many thanks,

Andy,

Sounds good. One comment: Vasant is swamped with work coordinating
several high profile projects. 

Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support
internally from other members of the group: this contribution
may not be directly visible but it will be still very important.

We appreciate your hands-on involvement. It's always the most
important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent 
interaction
with the customer. Look fwd to working on this project.

Vince

Guys,

Here is what I took away from our meeting:

1). Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline 
data.

2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data

3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort, 
presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am 
flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with 
its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this 
require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the 
right track.

If this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can 
discuss.

Thanks,
Andy

Subject: Forward oil prices  


Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

Subject: Daten


Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources
made available some proprietary historical forward price curves
from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were
used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine
years"

Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

Olaf Korn


p.s. Bei Rueckfragen stehe ich Ihnen jederzeit gern zur Verfuegung

Thanks for your help on content for EOL phase 2.

An additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is 
an options calculator.  This would be an interactive tool to teach less 
sophisticated counterparties about options.  We would like to collaborate 
with someone in research to refine our approach (and make sure we're using 
the right formulas).  Who should we contact in research for this?

Attached is a mock-up of what we have in mind...

Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your North American Gas 
Model.  I am however still interested in setting up a test process to 
familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.  

I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in December and 
will be back in touch soon.  I need to discuss this further with the business 
segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on the Long 
Term gas model.

Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced his 
name and number.  I thought that an e-mail response would suffice for now.  
My apologies.

Regards,

John Goodpasture

Stinson,

Thanks a lot for so much work you have done for the simulation model.
It seems that our work will make an impact on EOL trading, that is very
exciting.

Could you e-mail me the spreadsheet model so that I can catch up with
the changes you have made ?   

I read a few books during this vocation. Especially a stochastic processes
book, I finished the entire book.  The queueing theory is very fascinating,
 and hopefully we can apply the theory to a real EBS project.

I will take my family out to see the Nature Bridge Caverns near San Antonio
tomorrow.

See you on Tuesday. 

Happy New Year !

WHat is the status of Henwood?  Do you still want to engage them and what is

Hi Lola,

     As per our recent conversation, today we had a conference call with the 
Enron Research and Credit groups in the US and the UK.

     It was decided that we would require the folowing software to assist us 
in developing the Private Firm models:

  1.  Eviews statistical package
  2.  SPSS statistical package (The UK office already has an SPSS site 
license.)
  3.  TOPS software
  4.  Neural net software package (George in the UK developed this package).

     Please discuss submit these requests to Craig Chaney for his approval.

Thanks,
Iris

Vince,

Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -

I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been 
accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the 
information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his 
interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldn't be created from 
the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already 
made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.

I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform 
for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have 
looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I 
have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site, 
but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further 
suggestions would be appreciated.

I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications 
may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the 
websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a 
presentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.

Tom

Bonnie,

Thanks for getting back to me on Friday.

Enron will be contracting with Henwood for Henwood to provide an analysis of 
the Indian power system.   However, Enron will be providing a significant 
part of the input data used for the study including our views on the Indian 
market in the future and also very detailed information about our Dabhol 
plant.   We want to be sure that the information provided by us to Henwood 
remains confidential.  We also want to be sure that Henwood considers as 
confidential the results of this study provided by Henwood to Enron.

The Enron and related entities providing information are likely to include 

Dabhol Power Corp.
Enron India
also possibly Enron North America


The primary Henwood contact for the project is Robert Schenck in Australia at

Henwood Energy Services, Inc.
26 Greenhill Road
Wayville, SA 5034
Australia

The Henwood corporate office is in Sacramento:

Vince:  Apparently Neil McGregor became upset when he received Margaret 
Daffin's email.    He is saying, however, that Anshuman will only be in 
Houston for one month, and you had mentioned six months when we spoke 
earlier.   It really doesn't make any difference since he will need to get an 
L1 visa under either circumstance, but I thought you might want to see his 
email.

Subject: UK RAB Multiples

I talked with Keith Harris, our CFO at Wessex, about the RAB multiple graph I 
gave you.  He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and 
that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but 
very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of 
100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB 
multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down 
by 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer 
to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keith 
if he has not yet contact you.

Kevin,

Thanks for the heads-up. I'm doing face-time with a customer on Wednesday, 
but I'm in all day tomorrow, Thursday and Friday (I've a got a deadline to 
meet this PM). When would it be convenient to meet, and could we do it early 
in the morning so as to be able to conference Ansguman Srivastav (Enron 
India) into the meeting?

Subject: JCC

 Good morning.  I apologize for the response delay.  I've gone back through 
the analysis that I did back in April, and have thrown around some ideas with 
Vince and Stinson.  The issue may be summarized as follows.

 The hedge relationship was derived using JCC and prompt Brent, and is valid 
for JCC and prompt Brent.  No problems here.  However, it will not be valid 
for points far out on the forward curve.  Intuitively, this hedge 
relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve, but since 
there is no data, I can not statistically determine this.  One can imagine a 
term structure of heding ratios that start at 0.67 and move to 1.0, so that 
the back end of the curves would move together, but how fast it converges to 
one is anyone's guess.

 If there is a way of determining the historical JCC forward curve, then the 
hedge relationships may be estimated.  However, I have been unable to 
determine a rigorous approach to building the JCC curve.  

 I can explain this far better in person, and would like to talk as soon as 
possible at your convenience.

Folks,

Attached is a conservative (and fairly rough) estimate of the size of the 
petrochemicals and refining market that is potentially exposed to prolonged 
drought in southern Texas which could result in extremely low riverflows and 
possible curtailed production.   The total annual revenue generated by these 
assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the 
estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other 
facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.

Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial 
complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to 
experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties 
identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado, 
Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine 
whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.


Thanks,

Charlie

I think I will coordinate with Zimin, and have Guadalupe do some research on 
equities linked to corn price.  Initially, there will be some scenario

Shanbhogue yesterday and explained the deal and what we needed.  Should 
Vasant continue to work on it, or would you still like us to loop in Zimin

Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of 
credit support for MG and PaperCo.

My approach is as follows:

1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.
2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.
3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the 
default option)  using Black's formula.
4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is 
treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back 
this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced 
rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two 
NPV's.

Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.

Stinson

Jeff, 

I don't think this transaction makes sense. We should not keep increasing our 
exposure
in one area, given that we can deploy our capital in a more efficient way 
elsewhere,
without taking illiquid, long-term positions.

Subject: Matthew Patteson, Inventor

Vince,

After reviewing the documents furnished by Mr. Patteson,  I do not feel that 
Enron should consider engaging in any testing, development, or licensing of 
his proposed generator for the following reasons:

1.  Enron is not currently in the business of developing or manufacturing 
electrical generation equipment and does not plan, as far as I know, to enter 
this business.   The one exception is our ownership in entities developing 
wind and solar, renewable energy.

2.  Enron does not have the proper facilities or expertise to test or develop 
Mr. Pattesons proposed generator.

3.  There could be substantial risk in testing this generator as it would 
involve boiling of a flammable material under pressure.

4.  I do not believe that the proposed generator will produce any significant 
quantity of electrical power.   The generator produces power by induction.  
That is, electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field.   The 
mechanism powering the changing magnetic field is the movement of magnetic 
dipoles which are suspended in a boiling medium.   As the boiling will 
produce a somewhat random movement of the liquid, the "movement" or change in 
the magnetic field will be highly random and thus not suitable for producing 
a steady or reliable electrical current.

I have asked Martin Lin to also review the documents to render an independent 
opinion of this proposal.

Respectfully,

Dr. Stinson Gibner
PhD. Physics
VP Research, Enron North America

P.S.   Kevin and Zimin:  If you have any interest in reviewing Mr. Patteson's 
proposal, please let me know.

Stinson,

Attached please find a draft Consulting Agreement for use with Henwood.  

You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section 
6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and 
Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if 
that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K. 
law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law, 
would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so 
I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).

I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwood's proposal, and 
believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in 
their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the "Business Conduct" and 
"Drug Policy" language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement 
allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.  
Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost 
plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Phil, 
The optimization engine is ready and the graphical user interface is almost 
done. Attached please find the updated network design optimization 
specification. It contains some additions and modifications to the old 
specification I sent you a while ago. The major changes are:
  1. The program now also supports Ring design. and it can solve to optimality
  2. The graphical user interface is handled by Visual Basic on a PC. (Not on 
the web browser as in the previous spec.). 
Please take a look at the specification document and let me know if there is 
anything you want to add/change/remove...etc.
Moreover, please do not forget to send us a test example. 
We are buying CPLEX and will install it on our network. Hopefully our IT 
teams can configure your machine to run it in a few weeks.

Michelle,
I've just met with Cecil and Christin. We have divided the code into 3 parts, 
and Cecil's
looking at the first part. Cecil, Helen and I will meet again tomorrow 
morning to go through
the logic of the other two parts. Since Cecil is devoted completely to this 
project, once he
starts coding, it should not take too long. 

Best,
Alex

I sent a message with information to several different units but no 
response so far. I think people need a specific need to focus
and I shall keep the Chicago Partners in mind when a relevant
project arrives. I shall resend the message with attachments on
CP in a few weeks as a reminder.

Zimin,

This is the course description I got from Hal.    Can you follow up with him 
to schedule a date for a high level presentation?    I think we should keep 
it to only 90 minutes or so.    Maybe you and Kevin Kindall can be the 
presenters.

Actually, I am no longer scheduled to speak at the Risk conference on M-C 
techniques.   We could probably put together an internal training for you if 
you want.   I'll bring this up with Vince at our staff meeting tomorrow.     
It would be helpful if you can describe for me the intended audience and the

Attached are the historical numbers for the Semi-submersibles 4th and 5th 
generation day rates.  Their price is 155,000/day for the next 4 years.  I 
would think that a floor of $100,000 would be the place to start Jan 1, 2001 
through Dec 31, 2004.  We need to know the Call strike that would make it 
costless.

I plan on making some examples discussion purposes to discuss with them on 
Friday of this week.  I will update you ASAP on the balance of day rate 
prices.  Let me know what else you will need to prepare the statistical 
analysis.   The numbers include highs and lows; let me know your ideas on how 
to address this in the quote.

Thanks,

John

Bill,

Alex and I are working on the credit exposure model.  We finished the initial 
design issues regarding
input and output. We would like to have a meeting with you to seek feedback.  
We also preceeded
to write the underlying model.  So feedback at early stage can be important 
for the later development.

Paulo Issler is working on the short term enhancement to the credit loss 
model: adding asian option to
the model built by Vasant and Amitava.  

Let me know when is a good time for us to meet.

FYI.  This could be quite important for us.  Through forming a tradinf co. we 
could be brokering deals on behalf of MSEB, without letting them off the hook.

In this manner we could be doing short term deals and increasing despatch 
from Dabhol or other MSEB marginal units.  Any money flowing from these sales 
should go into an escrow account that goes directly towards payment of DPC 
bills.

In this manner we would be increasing the payment ability of MSEB.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Wade: The Group of Ministers on Foreign Investment had decided to recommend  
foreign equity participation upto 100% for trading in power sector, subject 
to prevailing laws. However, they left the final decision to the Union 
Cabinet. It is understood that a note supporting the recommendation of GoM is 
being put up for consideration of Union Cabinet. Since Power Minister is 
willing to support the proposal and Industry Minister is already OK with such 
proposals, I don't anticipate any problem at the Cabinet level. Let us wait

Ted,

Enclosed is a corrected version of the historical simulation of WTI 
trading.    The earlier results were double counting the spread profit on 
trades closed intra-day.   The spread was counted on each trade rather than 
per round-trip transaction, so the new results show lower profitability.

I want to thank you for your compliment to the work that we have done for the 
Liberty 
County Storage facility valuation. 

You and your talented associate Ms. Tian gave me a lot of valuable insights 
to understand all
the aspects of the deal, so it was also a great learning experience for me.  

If you think the Research can help you in any way to your deals,  storage, 
transport, MTBE, real options, 
or whatever,  just let me know, we will get the job done. 

Zimin

Paige,

Thanks a lot for  your presentation. It was an eye-opener in many cases.

I shall schedule a meeting with you next week to discuss how we can help you

in this project. I have some ideas I would like to run by you.

Vince


P.S. Shirley, please see if Monday is OK for 30 mins?

John,

We finished the Version 2 of the simulation model which deals with the
open-close trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version.

I added the cummulative P/L as an output.   There are a few apparent trading
strategies from this model:

1) Higher bid/offer spread, more profit
2) More Daily # of trades, more profit
3) Smaller net open positions allowed, more profit

1) and 2) are obvious, but 3) is more interesting.  It means that we are 
better off
if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day.  In a trending 
market,
this makes an intuitive sense, for example, in the case of bull market we are 
short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price
by keeping zero or small net short positions.

I have attached the model with this mail, and I'll  be happy to discuss the 
model
in more details with you.

Stinson and Vince,

I finished the second version of the model which deals with Open to Close 
trading.
The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open 
price which
will affect the P/L.

I also added the output features that John wants to see.

The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has
a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.  (the anomaly I 
discussed 
with Vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further 
examination).

Could you review what I have done before we talk to John again ?

Last night, I tested our new system for real-time surveillance and messaging 
of the weather, and it delivers the data to desktops throughout the building 
more than 6 1/2 minutes before the National Weather Service updates their 
webpages. Our current technology was web-scraping these pages via ftp, then 
parsing into a database. The impact of these 6 1/2 minutes for the hourly 
power traders is enormous- the weather stations upload their data around 53 
minutes after the hour, and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later. 
We can now re-estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour, 
when hourly power trading begins. Otherwise, we would not have model results 
until around 15 minutes after the hour. Notably, hourly power trading is, for 
all intents and purposes, concluded by then (they trade for 10-15 minutes and 
manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes). So, effectively, we may 
now be one *hour* ahead of where we were just a few days ago, in terms of 
information. People are very excited up here, from the CTO on down- thanks 
for letting it happen.

George,

We shall be able to accommodate one or two extra people
in the first round.

We shall be glad to repeat the seminars starting soon for a 
bigger group. We would like to learn form experience how to run
it.

By the way, we had an option training for EES (roughly 150 people,
over a few weeks). I can give you the materials and
we can repeat it if you think it's useful.

Vince

Deirdre,

I run two senarios using two different curves.

I got $1.39/mmBtu per year for IF-CNG/North, and
$1.41/mmBtu per year for IF-CNG/N_CITYGA.

Therefore if we look at 20 years time horizon, the storage
can generate  $1.40*1.4*20=39.2 MM dollars.

Let us discuss if you have any questions.

I have attached a background piece to brief oil traders on this subject prior 
to a possible meeting with them.

Please give me any comments on 1) accuracy  2) completeness and 3) coverage 
of the areas we want to explore.

As a side note, I found some info on the web stating current proven oil 
reserves are 1,000 billion bbls.  Discovery of a 1 billion bbl field would 
add only 0.1 %.  While we will pursue the trading advantage option, it is not 
looking promising that it has great short term value, given the long time 
frame and high cost of bringing deep water reserves to market.

Clayton,

Great news. I would like to sit down with you, Tom and Stinson and review 
where
we are with  this project. Also, I would like to talk to you about your 
status (finalizing
the transfer to another group).

Dave Delaney called an hour ago. He needed a statistic from EOL that the EOL 
folks couldn't give him (it seems they had a database problem in 1999), and 
the grapevine had it we had the data. Tom Barkley was able to give him the 
data he needed for his presentation, within a matter of 10 minutes or so.

Hi Trushar

Please find attached our draft analysis.  It is still very preliminary as we
have not been provided the latest version of legal documents and so the 
analysis
reflects our understanding of the economics of the transaction as outlined to 
us
based on discussions with Enron and available prior draft documentation..

The analysis uses the Enron share price as of March 28, 2000 ($72.81) and
assumes the LJM2 distribution is based on $30m or 25% IRR.  We anticipated 
that
this might reach 30% IRR based on Enron discussions with LJM2.

Please call Steve Stampf's phone number for tomorrow's conference call at 
9.30am
our time on 212 597 3162.

Regards

I actually called Stan Horton's office yesterday to find out if they knew

informed me that Stan cancelled our associate membership with AGA effective 
January, 2000.  I called Jay Copan with AGA back and left him a voicemail 
with the information.  I asked him to call me if he had any questions and I 
have not heard back from him.  I'll considered it closed unless I hear back 
from him.

Dear Vince:

I was referred by Rita Hartfield of EBS. I am the Director of Marketing for 
the Digital Content Services Team (David Cox, Frank Bay, et. al.). We are 
identifying and evaluating features and functions that will be a part of the 
next generation Entertainment on Demand (EoD) product.

The e-mail I've excerpted below contains two links to a company that offers a 
"preferencing" service that we know is quite popular and important to 
entertainment consumers. I have some questions abouts the statistics, 
sampling methodology, explained variance etc. of the model that The 
StyleLogic group employs.

Do you have a member of your team that could assist on this project? 

Thanks for your help,

I spoke with David ealier today.  He is planning a meeting with Jim Tour to 
due diligence the technology.  

I would like to put together a team to drive MEC's strategy, including a 
consolidation in Houston.  We would trade this commitment for warrants in the 
company and a right to participate in future fundings.  Effectively, our team 
could help drive the strategy for the company and due diligence a possible 
investment at the same time.

Thanks,

I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 
years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation 
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest 
in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough 
to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you 
all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend 
some time with them.

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and

There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

Folks,

I have been a bit quiet here since reaching India, primarily because of the 
delay in the arrival of the Henwood team from Australia.

They are finally arriving on Sunday, and Krishna is joining me in Mumbai on 
Sunday evening itself.

I would like to fix a schedule to have a conference call with you on the data 
and the type fo questions that you all would like to ask.

Stinson - Could you please tell me what time would be a good one for you all 
to hae a confernce call, but not earlier than Monday evening, India time 
(Monday morning Houston time).  Please jot me a note on what would be a good 
time for the call.

I will work out an agenda for the call.  Primarily, it will be discussion of 
the data and on what runs we should do to begin with.

Another key part of this will be the Rate Case that MSEB is filing, because 
this will determine what wil be MSEB's paymet capability in 2001/02.  This is 
critical for us.  We have our in-house expert who has been working on this 
for some time now, and he will also present some of the material on that call.

Regards,
Sandeep.

PS::  I am forwarding the basic data that Henwood has sent to the whole team 
so that you have an opportunity to look at it, if you havent already got it.

Vince,

Here are four graphs I came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of 
interest:

The first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different 
counterparties -



(Note the large part that Aquila plays!)

The other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week 
between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM for different categories of product. 
Natural gas and power have their own graphs, as they have the largest traded 
volumes. "Products" is for the remaining categories.



There are still some things I would like to take a look at. The databeacon 
software is now available, and can be reached at the following URL:

http://sassy.ect.enron.com/eol/eol_all.html

Do you have any specific questions that you would like me to try answering 
regarding EOL?

I have also started doing some research on automated trading platforms. Are 
there any websites and/or papers you would recommend I read?

Thanks,

Tom

Margaret,

The forward power and gas price curves, unlike NYMEX futures prices,
are not publicly available and are a closely guarded secret of the trading 
desks.
We have no authority to release them without getting the head of the
trading desk involved.

Gentlemen,

 Spoke to Vince K today and asked if he would send Stinson Gibner to Sidney 
to be available on Monday to review the X system.
Paul, make sure our X friends are available and the Confidentially Agreement 
is signed.  Further, I spoke to Phillip B. about a technical going too.

G'day mates,

Gary

Jeff,

A short follow up on the P+ options.

Attached is a chart showing historical correlations for calendar spreads 
between futures contracts.   It shows correlation over four different time 
horizons up to the roll of the nearest contract in each pair.   As you can 
see the level is usually higher than 0.98 and often near 0.99.    If our 
current book of "index P+" options were re-marked at a 98% correlation, it 
would result in a  reduction in M-T-M value of about $78 million according to 
my estimate.

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

Vince

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John

Vince,

Here are the overview Powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
relationship management firm, Azure Capital, I mentioned in my voice
mail.  The transactions they completed in their past lives at CSFB and
already in the new firm, as well as their advisory board are probably
the strongest evidence of their capabilities.

Hope all is well.

Michelle,
I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not
realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked 
earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts 
and
run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results.
This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like
we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but 
does not solve the problem. 

In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is 
optimal.
I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C,
but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Best,
Alex

Subject: Generation Earnings Model

Hi Alex-

Danielle and I were talking to David M. today regarding running the model for 
purposes of back testing the results. Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days 
of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration 
run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of 
data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are 
concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be 
increased to at least 500 iterations. 

We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful 
than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to 
how we can improve the process?

Thanks,
Michelle

Subject: Request for natural gas technical analysis

Hello Mike,

I work in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group, focusing on 
developing energy management relationships with large volume industrial 
energy consumers.  Due to the volatility and high price levels of the natural 
gas contract, these consumers of natural gas are extremely concerned about 
this exposure, and they are asking for our assistance in helping them manage 
this exposure. One of the tools that these customers are requesting is 
technical analysis of the natural gas contract so as to determine entry 
points for their hedges.

To the extent you could assist us with this analysis, we can  proactively 
meet these customer requests and increase our deal flow.

Please advise as to the availability of your assistance.  

Thank you, Tim

Margaret,

First of all I apologize for not sending you the information to complete the 
chart that you gave me.  I have been travelling because of work and then 
vacation, maybe I spent 3 or 4 full working days in the office in the last 4 
weeks.  Now that I am going through my to do list I cannot find that page 
that you gave me .  Could you  please send it to me again?

On the other hand I was wondering if maybe within Enron possibly at Info 
Central or with one of your friends at the trading desk you could get me a 
copy of a book titled:                   Chicago Board of Trade Commodity 
Trading Manual 
                      ISBN: 1579580025
                      Publisher: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Incorporated
                      Pub. Date: December  1997
 It si not in stock at the dot com libraries and it will take them a long 
time to deliver.   I need this bbok in order to produce a document that Steve 
Kean requested from me a couple of weeks ago.

Thank you very much for your help.

Best,

Ricardo

Simon,

Please forward a copy of my Ken Rice presentation to Vince Kaminski.  Send 
him the version with the white background.

Vince:

Thanks again for meeting with me today and I am pleased that you are 
interested in discussing this opportunity in more detail.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.  As discussed, the 
Enron Media / Advertising idea is being developed under EBS, but should 
develop into its own business unit.  

Enron Media / Advertising:
- Advertising Risk Book
- Physical Trades, supported by excess inventory from Cable Networks, Radio, 
Network TV, etc.
- Media Buying Service 
- Alliances with Advertising Agencies to sell Enron's "eyeballs" from our 
customer / server - ISP relationships i.e., US West
- Agencies could endorse EBS to their customers (Ford GM, Procter & Gamble, 
etc.) and become an Extended Enterprise for EBS and our EIN applications  
- Enron's Capital, to fund Content Development for the networks and 
Hollywood, which in turn would provide content for our pipes with licensing 
and syndication rights.
- An Enron On Line B to B opportunity (You may want to review the following 
sites: DoubleClick.com, Agency.com, AdAuction.com)

Mark and Kal:

Vince and I are meeting on Tuesday, March 28th @ 3:00 PM to further discuss 
the development of the Enron Media /Advertising concept .  Can you join us to 
provide a Customer and Agency perspective? 

Regards,
Michael P. Horning

Bill,

Alex and I are working on the credit exposure model.  We finished the initial 
design issues regarding
input and output. We would like to have a meeting with you to seek feedback.  
We also preceeded
to write the underlying model.  So feedback at early stage can be important 
for the later development.

Paulo Issler is working on the short term enhancement to the credit loss 
model: adding asian option to
the model built by Vasant and Amitava.  

Let me know when is a good time for us to meet.

Zimin

Subject: Exmar Purchase Decision


I just got off the phone with Jeff Skilling to make my pitch for doing the 
Exmar deal.  He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but 
simply
wants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a 
reiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply 
ask Vince's team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand 
alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price 
movements.   This would
be much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly 
look at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we 
could look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and 
also estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market 
(although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the 
ships because they will be treated as leases).

Subject: Exmar Purchase Decision


John,

After spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil 
groups, I have a slightly different angle on the Exmar LNG vessel decision.  
I would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do 
power and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and 
sometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can 
provide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:

1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship 
represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years 
and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also 
confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far 
East buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners) 
have reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has 
suggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant 
period.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow 
for a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million 
cost of this vessel.   

Pierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an 
illiquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG 
shipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a 
distressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a 
long term basis at a value of up to $200 million.  

2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to 
solve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a 
merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating 
leverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not 
this decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plant's time line 
and the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas 
Natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear 
threat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve 
our negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going 
forward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere 
in the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think 
that this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.

3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million
     Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  million

I would do it.

I will leave the rest to you.

Joe

Vince,

Please find attached a small note I had prepared at Wade's request.  The note 
is to be used for a private meeting of the ex-Chairman of MSEB with the 
governor of Maharashtra.  In the Indian system, the Governor represents the 
Federal government in the state.  Hence any information he gathers is for the 
Central Govt.

This informal note is to be passed to him.  The focus as you will see is to 
see if we can engage the Central govt. through this route.

Krishna is here and sends his regards.

Regards,
Sandeep.

I have tried to give it the appropriate spin.  

Let me know if there is something you would like to do differently on this.

Vince/Stinson,

Please find below two attachemnts.  The Excell spreadsheet shows some 
calculations on the savings from using Dabhol power as against a diesel 
genset operating at a higher heat rate.  There is also a differential in 
price of diesel, as against naphtha used by the plant.  I have taken data 
from the Septemeber bill of DPC.  We do not want to give the actual numbers 
to the press, since they ar likely to have a field day with the 6 cent/kWh 
energy price of Dabhol that is reflected there.

The seond attachement (Word) has the wordings that I think we can send in to 
the press.  Please review the calculations and the note, ad if you find this 
satisfactory, please forward to Jeff/s.

I am availabel on mobile if you have questions o clarifications.  The number 
(610 MW) for total captive generation in Maharashtra) is taken from Mohan 
Gurunath's presentation on this.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Bonnie Nelson, who has drafted the attached contract for the Henwood 
engagement, feels that we should make every attempt to put a written 
agreement in place immediately.  Otherwise, we may be in violation of Enron 
policy regarding contract work.   Can you review the document prior to coming 
back to Houston, so that it can be sent to Henwood?

Brad,

As we discussed, it's very difficult to find drivers of the ENE stock's 
behaviours.  We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market 
indices, and three energy commodity indices.  Regular regressions as well as 
regressions with different legs and leads were performed.  Some variables 
show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods, 
but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different 
or longer time periods.  
Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and  DOW Jones Utility 
Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a 
summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file 
"outputSummary").  But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%.  Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation.?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?it's hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock.  ?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock,  which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.  To capture, at least  trying to capture,  its ?characteristics in the new phase, we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ?market date.??Let me know if you need me investigate more variables or you come up with ?some new thoughts.????Vincent??

This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movie's gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback.

I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We can call it "Dynamic bid-ask price process".
In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last "tentative" price shown to the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)

I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via EnronOnline.com.

Subject:	calculating bid-ask prices


I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily.

One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post "tentative" bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price. These "tentative" bid-ask prices get updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price. Next week, we repeat the same process.

This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we don't take any position at all. We make profit from those bid-ask spread. We don't have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders' trading because we don't have to take any position. Let the market be the one who decides the price. 

If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

Thanks,
-Chonawee

Subject:	some more input

Hi Rich and Key,
Again I think your idea is very good. I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the "mark-to-market" charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money.
In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.)
We can offer other derivative products such as options as well.
-Chonawee

Zimin,

Andrea Reed asked for our help in looking for end-users of steel which might 
be used to take a commodity hedge position.    She will work on identifying 
potential equities or indices which might be used, and then we will analyze 
them for correlation or co-integration with steel prices.   Andrea should be 
contacting you next week regarding the project.     Hector has done 
co-integration analysis in the past and has the tools to do this project.

Thanks,

Anrdrea:   We will also need you to identify which steel prices/indices 
should be used in this analysis.

Gentleman:
        The ERMS system, as you know, has an excellent capability for 
decomposing option P&L into the following components:

new deals
curve shift
gamma
vega
theta
rho
drift
2nd order adjustments

What i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars.  
The unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position 
is being associated with specific prices.  These prices are the effective buy 
or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position.  

Stated differently, the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price 
variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma's 
standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs.  This is something I dont 
understand.  To date, inquiries to the risk management accounting group has 
further revealed that the gamma component of P&L is not well understood.  

This is what concerns me: Bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures (NYMEX 
and Gas Daily).  Both books dynamically hedged its positions during 
yesterdays large price move and, through anticipitory hedging in advance or 
during the large price move, secured sufficient coverage to neutralize 
expected changes in delta.  However, our P&L from our underlying position did 
not offset our gamma P&L.  Consequently, I have to ask WHY?  Im hoping that a 
brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which 
will better guide our hedging decisions.

Any help is appreciated

Steve,

Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards 
understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no
bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated
credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the 
code.

Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points. 

1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work
and she does not have the
necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help. 
It's
not that the work is beneath her.

2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston.
He effectively told them to go away and work on the "research projects"
and that he would take care of the IT issues. I don't think that it's just 
Tanya's issue,
though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.

3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on 
Tanya and
me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively
disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the
demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya
to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.

The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and
Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that 
it happens.
Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and
the system cannot fail.

Vince

Vince,

I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking 
about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular 
distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of 
multiple languages etc....

Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous 
occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?

The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current 
system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main 
development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved 
and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had 
a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation 
to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something 
they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I 
believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical 
people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively 
meaningless metric like portability.

On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted 
by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei 
is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working 
with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to 
find a common Valuation piece between the systems.

I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some 
time over the next few days?

Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our 
discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to 
all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. 
Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.

She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could 
get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would 
measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by 
inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling 
tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping 
through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that 
studying documentation wasn't enough. 

About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to 
psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. 
(in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and 
Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT "working together" document, 
which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.

Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do 
all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to 
do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT 
guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as 
it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is 
claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she 
continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and 
doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could 
be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and 
an IT issue and ask for help from research.

I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.

I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together 
over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their 
progress on Friday. 

In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that 
doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer 
term solution.

Regards

Steve

Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some 
typos.



Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread 
is $1 for simplicity, we take 5
 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is 
(-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading 
volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one 
trade, the total MTM is 
-5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading 
strategies is $10,000 for that
particular day.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by factor of 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change in millions.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

Vince-

I spoke with Tom, and I completely agree and would like to hand all this EOL stuff over to you.

We need a Sun server to take over the task. As it happens Martin Lin has one in his office he's not using and up to the task. His box could serve SAS to Enron, as well as handle listening in on the EOL feedds and maintaining its database.

Martin's box technically belongs to EBS, but I think they are downsizing and wouldn't mind giving it up.

In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody over the data and any work you do with it. I needn't be involved, and you can know your work is completely confidential.

I'll make SAS and the EOL software available, as well as the necessary RAM the server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some SysAdmin resources to finish the job. There is a fine Unix guy named Ben Thompson who will support you, I'm sure.

Task:

1) Upgrade RAM on Martin's server
2) Install newest Solaris OS on server
3) Install Tibco and GNU software on server
4) Install SAS on server

Subject: Sacramento Weather Station

Hey guys,
 We're talking to a contractor(s) that can build us a weather station 
(hopefully very quickly) for placement in Sacramento, California.  For a 
variety of legal, contractor, and operational reasons, I need to confirm some 
of the following requirements as soon as possible so we can proceed:

a)  You need rainfall, snowfall, and temperature measurement from one, 
high-accuracy commercially available weather station.
b)  You need a daily feed of this data to Enron's weather desk:  Does this 
mean one data dump at a set time per day?  Alternatively, will you need to 
check the data real-time, perhaps at varying and multiple times during the 
day? 
c)  We will be installing this station near Sacramento, California:  We will 
need to know exactly what areas in/near Sacramento are suitable for the site 
of the weather station.  (What again was the name of the town that you 
mentioned Mark?)  In the interest of time, I recommend that your weather 
expert accompany our landman to select the site, which will allow our landman 
to more quickly lease and install the station.
d)  You desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect 
tampering. I suggest given the very short time fuse, that we first install 
the station and then develop security measures.
e)  We will feed the data directly to the Enron weather desk.  Will any other 
parties require real-time access to this data?

Please forward responses directly to:  Chris Clark/NA/ENRON and myself. 
Thanks,  Scott

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and

There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

Vince/Vasant,

It has been some time since we spoke at the San Antonio conference.  
Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and 
had to be in bed for a long time.

In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to 
another state out of the Dabhol plant.  I have developed the concept whereby 
we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm 
power sale during the monsoon.

The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below 
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in 
Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the 
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.

I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will 
catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can 
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get 
some help from your end.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Please go through this and run the sensitivities and get a good idea of way 
to structure thsi.  Having gone through the comments, I feel that it maybe 
necessary to get some help on the structuring side.  I will try to get you 
some structuring expertise asap.  In the mean time, I would like you all to

Subject: Firm Power sale from Phase I - Issues

As discussed, please find enclosed  a word document which essentially 
discusses most of the issues involved with a Firm Power sale of 50 MW from 
Phase I, which would have to be sorted out with MSEB. 

Vivek & I have also worked out a methodology for computing tariff for this 
firm power sale during the peak period. In doing this, we have tried to keep 
the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to 
the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation; 
will put the tariff formula in the next mail)

The tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement, 
before we discuss it with MSEB.

Looking forward to your comments on both the issue list as well as the tariff 
computation.




regards,

Rajesh S

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

>From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Stinson and Vince,

I finalized the presentation for John Lavorato, he said he is ready
to present it  to Greg.  He is happy with the work we provided.


I will be on vocation starting next week.  I attached the simulation models
here in case that you need them.  The OC version deals with open-close
trading and CC version deals with continuous trading.


Should you have any questions, or need to run different scenarios, please
call me at home.  Otherwise, I will see you next year.


Merry Chrismas and Happy New Year !

Zimin

Subject: Changes in option valuation in Enpower

Sanjay

Wanted to confirm the changes to the option valuations in the Enpower we 
discussed yesterday evening.

1. Currently the trader volatility inputs are the daily vol curve and the 
intra-monthly vol curve. The monthly options get marked directly to the 
monthly curve (plus the smile) and the monthlies get marked to a time blend 
of monthly and intra-month vol (plus the skew).

We want to change the valuation (for the Eastern books) so that the dailies 
get marked to the intramonth curve (which we want to call the daily curve) 
and the monthly gets marked to the monthly curved. There will be not vol 
blending done by the Enpower system for the daily and monthly option 
valuations. We want to make this change very soon (by early next week)


2. Currently there exists one smile for every region, which is specified in 
terms of volatility additive  for specified dollar difference from the 
underlying. Since different months in a region can trade in a large range 
($35 - $150) - this cannot result in accurate skew for all terms.  What we 
need is a system which has skew per month.

We suggest, for the short term, the skew should apply only to the summer 
daily expiration options. We need to make this change by early next week.

However, we need to start modifing  the system so that for every region we 
can enter a grid which has a percentage scale and specifies the skew 
differently for each month.  Research, has implemented this in our pricing 
model, and we would like this grid to be input into the valuation system.  I 
am enclosing the pricing model (which we both discussed yesterday) for 
reference. This model is however, work under construction, so pls call Alex 
Huang for clarifications.

3. The vol input system is complex and confusing.
I would very much be interested in moving to a direct database interface, 
which accomodates the skew inputs per region as in <2>. We should implement a 
UI which can input the dailies and monthlies at the moneys and the skew grid 
directly - so that we do not need to go through multiple iterations.
I am very much interested in what we currently are releasing in Delphi and 
would love an early implementation for options.

On all these issues, I am speaking for the East desk. I am going to touch 
base with West guys and see if they are on board with these changes.


Thanks

Hi Vince,

	Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for each region from David Hoog's Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy David's outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve to mark the non-firm position.
	My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in David Hoog's court to build the curve if David wants to sell his product internally to the desk.  
	Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define "non-firm"?  The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of David's outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.  Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the "non-firm curve for the region"?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or group of units.

Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.

Thanks,
	
Vasant

Below, I have summarized Henwood's work on the  India database to date. 
?
The "Inter_Regional Links.ppt" file shows the  topology and links between 
bubbles in the our model and  "Expand_India_Data_011000.xls" details the 
existing station information that we  have compiled to date.?Total resources 
closely match reported resources as  shown in "L&R_0110.xls". Reported India 
total in 1997 is 86,000 MW and that  in the Henwood database is 84,000 MW 
through 1997.

Vince,
 While I was at HSB, I designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model 
that HSB uses for new product development, pricing different reinsurance 
strategies, computing stochastic earnings forecast, and estimating 
probabilistic maintenance & repair costs. The code, written in Visual Basic & 
MS Access belongs to HSB, and I want to replicate it here for our use at 
Enron. I would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps 
Vasant who was briefed on the model, about how we can use your group for the 
analytical and programming support to get this model re-constructed.
 I have screen outputs from the code and Vasant thought the re-design and 
construction here at Enron is a problem that your group can do. Could you let 
me know when we can setup an hour to discuss?
Thanks,
Rick Jones

Lenny,

I believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit 
issue.  However, it may
make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed 
in the future. 

I am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit, which is built into 
the strike price for the
digital option. With the tax credit,  it is most likely the option will be 
exercised.

Paulo  Issler is the person who worked on this model initially. He will be 
back this Wednesday.
We can talk to him about the standard deviation he put into the model.

Zimin, 

Thanks for your e-mail.  Sorry for the late reply, I was travelling last week.
I'm under the impression that the with the new administration, there is a 
greater chance that Section 29 will be extended beyond 2007 than repealed. If 
this happens, we contractually have the right to extend this contract. We 
have not valued the chance of this happening, so I don't think we should 
value the chance of this not happening.

Anyways, let me speak to my supervisor on this and revert.

In the meantime, I looked over the amendment you made with regard to adding 
the second strike of the tax credit and think this is now reflective of the 
deal and am happy with it. I still do not understand a few things re:  where 
did the St. deviations come from. I believe you said that someone who works 
for you put this together but was away last week.

Please revert with his/her name so that I can get together and understand 
this.

Thanks.

Subject: Synfuel option valuation



Lenny,

I think we had a good discussion about the deal valuation. 
One thing, I think you are prefectly aware of it, is that the economics
of this deal is driven by the tax credit ($25.03).  The risk on our side
is that if the tax credit is removed, AIG will not deliver the synfuel 
 and pay $4.55 to us.  

Vince mentioned that Congress might act  quickly enough to eliminate 
the tax benefit.   I just want to remind you we should take this risk 
into consideration. 


Zimin


PS: 
I changed the results in sheet1 slightly. The values in column A was shifted
by 0.5.  Use the attached model.

Could you plug in these numbers to the loan guarantee model ?
Promigas is rated as BB.

Lance and I spoke with Tim Heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for 
the West Desk.  The differences in the markets between East and West are, in 
Tim's opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated 
as the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits for 
which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loop 
flows are also not considered a major issue at present.

In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extension 
to an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also done 
little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.

John,

Sorry for the confusion.
This is a second  tanker on which very few details
are available . The LNG group is working as we speak
to provide some information for Joe Sutton before
his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon.
There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte
on Monday to send me one and was not told that
he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest
substitute.

Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision 
has to be
made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals 
have already
been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or 
two.

Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

Vince

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John

Michelle,
The coding is progressing nicely. Cecil and David have the first part of the 
code
almost done (there are 3 parts of code), and they expect to have the first 
two parts
completed by next Tuesday or Wednesday.  If Ken's needed, that will be in the
testing of the third part of code,  which should be sometime next week or 
later. 
I will inform you of the status change as soon as possible.

Best,
Alex

HI Iris:

May 17th is fine.  He will probably need to come in the night before (the 16th)
and he can make a hotel reservation at the Doubletree or the Hyatt and tell
them he is a guest of Enron and he will get a corporate rate.  We will reimburse 
him for room expense only.  He will need to pick up any miscellaneous room 
charges.   We will also reimburse him for his flight expense and cab fare.
The Doubletree Telephone # is:  713-759-0202 and the Hyatt Telephone is:
713-654-1234.

He can either leave his receipts with me when he is here or mail them
to me and I will have a check cut.  I will need his SS#.

If you have any more questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley

Vince/Stinson,

The note below gives us the authorization to proceed.  I have received no 
comments from Wade on my signing, but I have his approval for the study, so I 
will proceed on that basis.

Since we do not have any format of confidentiality agreement from Jim, let us 
use the one signed by the legal team for the Japan study by Henwood.  In this 
reference, could you (Stinson) get this from either Heather Mitchell, or John 
Viverito (who is the lawyer involved with Japan, reporting to Alan 
Aronowitz).  We could use that as template and proceed before Friday on that 
basis.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Wade/Jim,

My apologies for missing the conference calls yesterday and today.  I was not 
able to download my messages in time for the calls, but I will be on going 
forward.

While I am still on vacation, I have been in conversation with Vince and the 
Research Group following up on the Henwood study we had spoken about.  We 
have received a formal proposal from Henwood, and they are wanting 
authorization to go forward.  The study will get us the despatch forecasts 
for the next 8-10 years, and will deliver the results by January end, per 
Henwood.

Vince and I have reviewed the proposal, and feel that we should proceed.  We 
will be fine tuning the assignment as we go forward.  The big issue there is 
the data for the model/s, and at this point Henwood is relying more on us to 
provide the data.  We spoke to Henwood yesterday, and I will be on another 
call with them on Friday.

I need your confirmation on the following:

That I have your approval to proceed ahead with the study 
That the study shall be paid for by DPC, and if so, is it OK for me to sign 
the authorization being sent by Henwood
We will need a formal confidentiality agreement to be in place by tomorrow 
(Jim - if you have a particular format, please let me know)
I am leaving the issue of hourly rates and cost to the Research group since 
they have more experience in dealing with groups like Henwood.  They feel the 
costs are reasonable, and I will leave it at that.

We will need to collect data from the different sources we have in India, and 
I have proposed that there be a formal session in India between Henwood and 
the ENE team in India in the week between 10th and 15th.  This is important 
to insure that there are no disconnects, and that there are no illusions on 
the quality of the data that will be available.  It will also help us 
formalize the scope and better define the issues.  In order to meet the 
deadlines, the data will have to be in place by January 15th.

I will call Jim later today (I had called but you were on a call).  I am here 
till the weekend when I leave for India.  Please let me know if this 
arrangement is OK.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Michelle, 
Cecil and David's code was correct but could not match Ken's spreadsheet
output due to a slight mis-specification in Ken's Excel spreadsheet. The code
was then modified to conform with Ken's specification and results very close
to that of Ken were obtained. As of now Ken's modifying his spreadsheet to
re-run the results, the original correct code will be restored, and we will 
see what
happens then. Anyway this is rather encouraging. 

Best,
Alex

The model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of
power plants of Gencos. It is to give trader a better insight as to whether 
the
market is overvaluing/undervaluing certain Genco stocks, and trader can
act accordingly.  I'm still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use 
it. 

Modeling details:
The model takes in all Gencos' locational power forward prices and fuel 
forward
prices, and uses GARCH model to simulate one year daily prices, and then
uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices.  GARCH model 
parameters
are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and 
are updated twice a year, and it does not matter whether the simulation starts
in January or September. 

Using these prices, it will determine whether a unit at a particular location 
will be dispatched
or not depending on A) spread of power and fuel prices, and B) whether the 
start-up
cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours.  The unit can be dispatched at
minimum and peak levels. Fixed O&M, SOX and NOX (I don't know what the last 
two stand for)
are taken into consideration. 

With the simulated dispatch schedule, the model calculates the value that can 
be generated
by this unit, then sums it up across all units.

The final value is the average of 100 simulations.  And it takes about 16 
hours to run for about
200 units.  

After our conversation, the consultant promised to look into A) how to make 
the model more flexible,
say, to allow a different time horizon, B) reduce spreadsheet overhead by 
doing calculation one
unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information (as of now it 
saves everything 
on the spreadsheet).

Assuming the GARCH process is modelled correctly, I believe the methodology 
is OK, though 
it does not capture most of  the optionality. 

My concerns are:
Whether the price processes are modelled correctly. I have to get more 
details before making
any conclusion.

100 simulations are way too few. Unless we convert the algorithm to C, I 
don't see how spreadsheet
can handle more simulations. I guess that's why they contact us. But again, 
if Enron's buying the
model from the consulting company, why should Enron do their job for them?

How trader's going to use the model output. For this I phoned Jeff (the 
associate who initiated all
these) and am still waiting for his returning call.  A related questions why 
the model horizon is one year. 

We can either
Oversee the conversation, but not doing actual coding for them.
Or
Redo the model for them. (The problem still remains that how trader's going 
to use the output).  But 
in view of the Great Wall of China separating the business units, should we 
do it?

As of now I have a simulation model taking start-up cost, fixed O&M, rump-up 
delay into consideration.  
It simulates monthly prices (using GBM) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run 
10,000 simulations for 
one unit for ten years (120 time steps).  It can use forward-forward vol and 
incorporate seasonality into
it (I understand this is debatable). (One interesting observation is that 
when using forward-forward vol
simulation, the standard deviation is about 0.5%, while standard deviation 
using forward vol is about 
2%. Also, incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1.6%). Since 
most of the time-cost 
occurs in price simulation, and we are to simulate about 20 price processes,  
I hope the full model 
(if we build it) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units. The main 
task will be interfacing, i.e., 
getting data from data base, and outputting the results. This is where I need 
most help if I am to do it.

Please advice the course of action. I am supposed to talk to Michelle 
Cisneros today. 
p.s. I never promised to oversee a programmer in our group (see the message 
below). 

Best,
Alex

Subject: Margin Collar

I wanted to give you the status on the BP margin collar deal.  We submitted a 
bid to BP yesterday where BP would pay Enron just under $5 MM to assume the 
contract.  We have yet to have further discussions, so there's not much more 
to report than that.  We greatly appreciate your help on this project.  I 
feel like we put together a very good bid, and measured the risks 
appropriately with limited time.  I will keep you informed of how the 
negotiations proceed.

Thanks again,

Lee Jackson

Subject: Introduction


Vince:

   As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then
about CDS,
the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest
privately owned
manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing 
its
finances,
so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual
revenue and
to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the
business of
manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))
food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other
products.

Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that
emphasizes the
long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win
solutions with
its suppliers, customers and partners.

As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its
expenses
goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of
researching
those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand
(people
eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).

CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very
successful,
with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in
these arenas.
CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports 
the
purchasing
function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a
multidiscipline and
multinational team with a lot to offer.

Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based
on
manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in 
this
area.
Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to
talk to.

In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to
anything
at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to
pursue the opportunity
we discussed in the future.

I am looking forward to our video conference call.

Kind regards,

Avi

Dwight and I are working to develop an updated valuation for the MTBE and 
methanol business segments.  We would appreciate assistance from your group 
in assessing the market over the next 3-4 years.  

With the octane shortage this summer, and the strong gas and oil price 
environment, MTBE prices are well above budgeted levels.  How will 
political/environmental issues affect MTBE prices over the next few years.  

Methanol prices are also now very favorable, but it would seem that North 
American methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in NA remain 
higher than the rest of the world.

Your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most 
helpful.  Both Dwight and I are available to meet with you or a member of 
your group as soon as convenient.

Thanks, sorry we missed you today.

Paulo,

I have talked to Vince and Stinson about the Credit Model enhancement and 
extension.

We will pull other reseource for the Potential Exposure model, so you will be 
relieved from this more 
challenging part of the project.

Due to our limited manpower, everyone is overloaded with multiple tasks.  So 
we still think you
are the best person for the short term project which is adding the asian 
option to the existing model (ask
Amitava for help if needed).

I do not mind if you want to re-negotiate with the customer about the 
delivery date, but keep in mind that EES
has done deals requiring the asian option valuation in the credit model.

Subject:	Petrochem Desk

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

>From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Vince,

Sorry, I was not able to take your call this morning, to avoid distractions I 
was editing a technical coner article on PPP out of my office.  Last Friday, 
I called Robert Johnston immediately after you told me to contact him to 
brief him on nonferrous metals.  I let him know that I was scheduled to speak 
about Metals in our research meeting on October 12th.  I also talked with him 
a few weeks ago that I would like to meet with him and Scott Tholan to brief 
them on metals.   Robert did not arrange the meeting.  I arranged a meeting 
for 10:30 tomorrow to take them both through the metals fundametals speech.  

The London Metals Confererence sounds great, since I have five years 
experience in metals fundamental analysis and pricing, I would also like to 
attend.  Many of my new research group customers are asking for my expertise 
in this new business for Enron.  I could certainly help our customers better 
by getting the latest information on metals.  Please let me know if this is 
OK with you.


Regards, 


Maureen

Mark,

Steve's comment has many merits. I think Stinson Gibner and Grant Masson 
(physics Ph.D.'s) can help to identify
academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims.

On the other hand, even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in 
their time estimates, the technology
they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous 
potential payoffs. It make sense to 
stay close to them and  to explore potential investment opportunities.

Vince

I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 
years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation 
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest 
in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough 
to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you 
all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend 
some time with them.

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and 
Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.  
There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

Bob -

Thanks for your help on this - it is exactly what we were looking for.  I 
also wanted to let you know that I will be revising some of these numbers and 
asking you to rerun the probability table.  I hope that this is not a problem.

thanks again

		 Subject: Re: Joint Probabilities

The attached spreadsheet has been updated to include probabilities for 
exceeding stated stock prices in each year.  

These numbers represent the probability for all combinations of RAB ratio and 
exchange rate.  For example, 2003 shows a stock value of 7.38 for a RAB=1.1 
and Fx=1.5.  We previously showed the prob of exceeding a stock price of 
7.38, AND RAB > 1.1, Fx > 1.5 as 14%.  The probability of exceeding 7.38 for 
all possible values of RAB and Fx is 35% (interpolating between 40% and 27% 
in the price table).

Neil,

You must have already gotten my earlier mail of clarification.  Going 
forward, I agree with you that we should start the assigment early rather 
than late.

However, I would not necessarily like to wait till even Feb 5.  The bids for 
LNG must go out by the 15th of Feb, and we need to do a lot of fuel based 
analysis before then.  Hence, if it is possible for Anshuman ot be available 
before then, I would greatly appreciate it.  Perhaps even as early as Monday 
or Tuesday if possible ??

Regards,
Sandeep.

Thanks for the clarification Vince I appreciate it. We have a significant 
resource problem here in India, given we have a renegotiation about fall in 
our laps. Anshuman is one of our key analysts and we are very proud of his 
abilities and future potential for Enron. Once we have Dabhol off the "life 
support system" we could look at a longer assignment. As far as the present 
one month assignment is concerned, I would rather go for an early start say 
5th Feb till 5th March. Is this convenient to you and Jeff.

Neil,

I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman.
We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion
regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep
every few days).

Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month
to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request). The lawyers advised
me that we need an L1  visa  for him, irrespective of the duration
of  his stay.

Sorry for the confusion.

Andrea,

We finished the the costless collar valuation. See the spreadsheets for 
details.

We checked the Bloomberg for volatility assumption. The 100 days volatility is
around 50%.  Since the option is for 3 years, the volatility should be 
somewhat smaller.
So we put an array of calculations, with the volatility ranges from 20% to 
60%.

If you have any questions,  please call me or Bob Lee.

Zimin

Jeff,

I got 20 cents for the swith option per Dth. My assumptions are as follows:

price curve assumption:
Waha   --- IF-WAHA
La Plata Pool  and TW(Ignacio)   -- IF-EPSO/SJ
California Border -- NGI-SOCAL

Correlation assumption:

Waha- SJ  95%
Socal-  SJ  90%

See the attached spreadsheet for more info.  Call me for questions.

Zimin,
We're trying to price out a "live" options deal.  Here are the parameters:

Volume: 32,000 Dth/d
Term:  Jan. 1, 2002 through Oct. 31, 2006 (58 mos.)
Price:  One part rate, $0.2175/Dth, plus applicable fuel 
Primary Receipt/Delivery Points: (East - to -East Transport)
 Receipt: La Plata Pool (use San Juan, Blanco price equivalent)
 Delivery: Waha area 

Option:
 Alternate Delivery Pnt.:  California Border (East - to- West Transport)
 Price:
 Floor-  $0.2175/Dth, plus 4.75% pipeline fuel, plus 50% of the difference 
between the California Border index
  price and the San Juan Basin index price.  Specifically, we'll use:
      (SoCalGas large pkgs. minus TW (Ignacio, pts. south))

An important things to consider:
This option is only for Alternate Firm deliveries.  Alternate firm is really 
just a glorified version of interruptible.

Can you run the option model and tell me what is the dollar value of this 
rather "unpure" option?

I appreciate it.  Give me a call at 3-1521 if you have any questions.  Also, 
can you get us an answer by Friday, 10/13/00?  We're looking to get the 
proposal out to the customer by the end of the week if possible.  Thanks.

meeting all these people involved in F/X trading activities. 

I just want to ask you if you could send me over the mail the latest forward

will contact Pushkar going forward.

Thanks again and I look forward to talk to you again.

Hi all,
The scheduled Wednesday (Nov. 8) presentation has to be cancelled.  Even 
though in his earlier message
Mike said Wednesday is ok, now they will have problem sending people. 

I will try to reschedule the presentation to a later date.

Best,
Alex

Subject: RE: WeatherDelta demonstration scheduling


Alex, I'm glad that we had a chance to talk today about a WeatherDelta
overview.  The 8th is not really going to work well for us, due to recent
reschedulings.  Several members of the WeatherDelta team will be in or near
Houston on the 14th and 15th of November (I know that you said that week was
tight), and could arrange to be in the several weeks following those dates.


I have attached our standard non-disclosure agreement, which we will need to
execute prior to the product demonstration.  I have also attached a reprint
of a recent article, describing WeatherDelta's approach and functionality.
As soon as a meeting can be scheduled, a list of attendees would be very
helpful to us in preparing the appropriate materials.

Thank you again,

Michael Denton

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.


Vince

Vince and Grant,

I have been made responsible for all gas and power curves in South America 
(plus books development, reporting, .......).  I have somewhat started but, 
since I am new on the job, I'd love to receive advice, guidance (and at some 
stage help) from you.  Would you be available for a meeting next week, 
preferably Thursday or Friday?   I'm planning to be in Houston these days.

John,

I prepared the presentation in the way we discussed on Wednesday. 
In summary I have included the following scenarios:

Tenor:  1, 3, 5 years back from Nov, 2000
               1, 3, 5 years back from Nov, 1998
               1, 3, 5 years back from Nov. 1995

Number of trade per day:  200, 600,1000

Bid-offer spread:  $0.04 and $0.06

Net Open position allowed: 1,000,000 and 5,000,000

Volume per trade is fixed at 1,000 BBL.

All together, there are 9*12 =  108 scenarios included in the presentation.

I will be on vocation starting next week.  But I will check my e-mail and 
phone
messages to make modifications you need.    

Happy Holidays,

Zimin

Vince,
 While I was at HSB, I designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model 
that HSB uses for new product development, pricing different reinsurance 
strategies, computing stochastic earnings forecast, and estimating 
probabilistic maintenance & repair costs. The code, written in Visual Basic & 
MS Access belongs to HSB, and I want to replicate it here for our use at 
Enron. I would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps 
Vasant who was briefed on the model, about how we can use your group for the 
analytical and programming support to get this model re-constructed.
 I have screen outputs from the code and Vasant thought the re-design and 
construction here at Enron is a problem that your group can do. Could you let 
me know when we can setup an hour to discuss?
Thanks,
Rick Jones

Kevin,

Thanks for the information. For avoidance of doubt, please confirm:

That the  relationship means that to hedge ten thousand barrels of JCC in 
September '00, I would have to enter into a financial transaction for 6706 
barrels of Prompt (August) Brent, and;

That this email constitutes your groups (Vince Kaminski's) sign-off on using 
this hedge ratio to hedge JCC and JCC-based products?

Thanks in advance,

Marc de La Roche

 Good afternoon.  I have performed a review of the JCC data that you sent

and are available upon request.  Relevant charts are embedded in the 
Powerpoint attachment.  Questions/comments welcome.

Rick,

I read your memo regarding Global Risk Management Initiative.  I am sending 
you the
information regarding a related initiative on which I have been working last 
year and which
is moving now into the implementation stage. It's Enterprise - Wide Risk 
Management
and it's really an effort to measure business risks consistently across the 
company.
I hope my group can be helpful in designing the general approach to this 
problem.

Please, let me know what your thoughts are.


Vince

Great to hear that.  You are right, we should include Rho (done) and Theta 
(to do) for the cost term.

Zimin,

the model worked well today.  Hopefully it will continue the same in the 
future.

Do we need to make a similar change in the model to "Drift" to account for 
changes on the Demand Charges over time?

Maureen- thanks for your outstanding presentation on Friday.  Sorry again for 
the difficulties in scheduling.

I can see some excellent collection opportunities for our group as a result 
of your presentation and look forward to discussing them with you on my 
return.  We think we can get excellent info on production & exports in 
Russia, as well as good insight into anti-dumping out of DC and the WTO.  
Labor unrest, environmental problems, civil unrest are other possibilities.

FYI, the speeches from today's LME seminar will be posted on the LME website 
tomorrow.  You may be particularly interested in the outlooks for aluminum, 
nickel, and copper.
