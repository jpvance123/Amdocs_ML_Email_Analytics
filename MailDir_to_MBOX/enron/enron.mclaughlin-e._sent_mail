Subject: Mexico March Originations

Errol,

Please review the following file (the tab marked "2001 Summary") and help me 
answer the following questions for March:

1.  Two additional originations "corrections" of $379.50 each were granted to 
Mexico, but I don't think they belong to us.

2.  The $338,955 Vitro Corporativo Deal #QW8224 was not granted to Mexico, 
but my originator, Agustin Perez, says it should have been.  Please let me 
know if you are responsible for this deal.

I will be in Monterrey from Wednesday through Friday but will be checking my 
voicemails & e-mails periodically, so please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,

NHV

Hey Sherry,

Here is the spreadsheet with the Duke Energy Marketing deals that I need you 
to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  I need to get an 
invoice to them within the next few hours as they need to settle with us on 
Monday.



If you could go through your book and flip any deals between ENA and Duke 
Energy Marketing LP to the P& book to settle with ECC that would help solve 
some problems.  Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Just 
to let you know, Carole Frank took notes this morning when I walked her 
through running that download in TAGG.  It can be done for any counterparty 
in any book, so you can also run it for Duke Energy Marketing LP as well.

Thanks
Stacey

Durch,

It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly. Instead of deal QF9221.1 
netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.  I have killed deal 
NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.

Errol,

Check this in the system and see if he is being billed for the original deal 
and an unwind deal to net him to the correct position.
Let me know or contact Perry please.

John - Could you please alert your back office that they are still invoicing
us on a Nov-Mar strip that was traded on June 20, 2000 at $4.105.  That deal
was cancelled per our discussion and rebooked for half the volume in
November (I beleive it was November).  Your deal number on the rebook is
QF9221.1 I beleive.  I beleive Dutch Quigley on your end was involved when
we originally discussed the deal.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.

John,

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Sharon,

I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with 
the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change 
an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We 
will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them 
from the Structuring group.

The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market 
quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.

I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Sharon,

Robin Rodrigue and I tried to give you a call, but your voice mail says that 
there is no message recorded.  We looked at the October P/L and could not 
find an "Other" column with $9.2MM in it.  If you could, please give Robin a 
call at X5-7478, and she will be happy to answer your questions about this.

Thanks,

Errol

We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is 
extremely important that any deal booked to the East is communicated quickly 
to someone on my team.  I know it will take some time for the new names to 
sink in and I do not want us to miss any positions or P&L.  

Thanks for your help on this.

Errol,
I noticed a small mistake late last night.  Their is West orig on your Orig 
schedule that is not 0.  It is already on the west schedule so the value just 
needs to be taken off your orig schedule tab.  

The cells that need to be set = to 0 are p41 and q41

thanks,

The previous two nights I have attempted to split out the Positions and P&L 
as we discussed.  I now feel confident in the Positions part of this process 
(Mike's swaps in the Exotic book,  new blotters, etc.).  The P&L portion of 
the process has been significantly more difficult, but after working through 
last night , I will have the P&L completely split out by the end of today.

Thanks for your help & patience,

Errol

Hey Johnelle,

It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage 
the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk 
management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job 
and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are 
Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now?  
When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 
'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage.  
Call me when you get a minute!!

Errol,

We are trying to make sure that everyone that is trading options with us off 
line are aware that we have both GD and Price Options on EOL.  Do you have a 
list of companies that are trading with us? If not a post ID would suffice.  
I still have some queries that I can run from my risk days.  Thanks for your

Irena,

The team provides us with great service currently.  The only area of 
improvement I can think of regards new-hires.  I need to give you and your 
team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.  If we could come 
up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic 
supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that 
would help.  I know that the last few people that have come on were last 
minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.  Hopefully, we 
won't have as many space issues in the future.

I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.  I will work hard 
to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.

Thanks,

Errol

that the administrative team can do/improve for your group(s), that can 
cause  a substantial change for the best?  

 After I receive these listings, I will be meeting with each of you to 
discuss.

Thank you,

Irena

Errol,

There are two trades that were done with Mirant Americas through 
Intercontinental Exchange.  TAGG does not reflect these trades.  I faxed the 
broker statements to Sherry D. and she stated that she forwarded them to 
you.  Trade dates were on Nov. 13th and Nov. 14.  I also asked Joe Hunter to 
check into this and he stated that he had spoken to you some time last week 
or the week before and stated that you would be getting back with me on the 
TAGG deal numbers.
 
When I querried TAGG this morning selecting Intercontinental Exchange as the 
broker, no deals were found.

Can you please let me know the deal numbers as these trades need to be 
settled as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mechelle

Shannon,

I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you 
will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to 
split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and 
options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it 
done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not 
heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice 
mail.

Thanks,

Errol

Errol,

I received a book request for the NG Options Book (Code ZH). Will this be a 
new roll in the NG Price book, associated with the PG book code? Also, I 
noticed that the PG book has three DPR's in the February folder. Should I be 
using the 022001NG DPR or the 022001NGmike and 022001NGjohn? What did you and 
Todd decide to do with the January variance from the NGP&L? Too many 
questions!!

Thanks!

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by

Subject: Aquila Canada Corp. deals in your books

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks
Stacey

Vikas,

Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.  Each file has a tab 
for the swap position and the option position.  For the options I have added 
an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.  I 
apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an 
appropriate format.



Thanks,

Homer,

I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able 
to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the 
gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this 
issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can 
save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to 
Email.

Thank you,

The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue

As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital 
and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the 
NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are 
positive value to the book.

A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000).  
The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are 
awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.

Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last 
night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor 
behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all 
drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A 
few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the 
alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  

I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left  
Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite.

See you soon,

E.L.M.

Hector,

Monday, Nov 27, Joseph Taylor will be starting in my group - Risk Management, 
Financial Books.  Dutch Quigley was spearheading the effort with H.R. to 
bring Joseph to Enron.  Dutch has moved on to a new group and is currently on 
vacation.  If you could, please send me Joseph's Social Security  number, so 
that we can get him set up with phones, computers, etc.  

Also, who is my main contact in H.R. with regards to job postings, receiving 
resume's, interviewing, hiring, etc.

Thanks for your help,

Errol and Joey,
Just an FYI - 
The Middle Market - West gas orig group is changing it's name to Gas 
Origination - West.  Now when you enter Orig into the West file the Orig 
Group should be the new name.  
Also, on your Orig Schedule please start showing the West orig as Gas 
Origination - West so that everything will match when it is published to the 
web. 

thanks,
brad

Bob,

I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and 
options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be 
the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book 
administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should 
correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary 
worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel 
free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.




Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate 
Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not 
officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put 
together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every 
book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these 
problems can be fixed before the morning.

The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.

Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,

Errol L. McLaughlin

These annuities were paid to the counterparty after several deals we had with 
them were restructured.  George Gilbert (the originator responsible) has 
already confirmed the deals with the counterparty.

Jeff,

I wanted to give you an update on George's start date.  He is finishing up a 
project currently, and is looking at February 19th as a start date.  However, 
he feels that there is a strong possibility that he will finish earlty and be 
able to start on Feb. 12th.  I will keep you updated.

Thanks,

Hi, Errol:

I am doing great because I am going to join your group soon.  

I have a project in hand.  It was expected to be finished by mid Feburary and 
my current unit would let me go on Feb. 19.  
I am pushing hard to finish this project by the end of next week.  But I 
cannot guarantee it now.  Later this week I will have a better idea of 
whether I could report to you on Feb. 12.  Do you think this is OK?

I look forward working with you soon!  Have a great day!

Here is the information we looked at on Thursday .  It is updated for our 
current position.  Through looking at this you will see that our risk is to a 
significant up move in prices.  Currently, prices are not moving up 
significantly.

Thanks,

These deals were killed because we have terminated all deals with BP CAPITAL, 
T BOONE PICKENS, and PICKENS FUEL CORP.  Since there were so many deals we 
did not put comments in the deals.  However, deal tickets have been provided 
explicitely explaining what the Middle Market Group is doing w/ these 
companies.

George,

How are you doing.  Well, I hope.  Could you just give me a quick shout and 
let me know when you think you will be able to start in our group.

Thanks,

Frank,

I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I 
alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.  
This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still 
working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.

Thanks,

Errol

Sue,

I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after 
you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book 
administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the 
counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk 
are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail 
frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises 
tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because 
there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing 
up on your report.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

Frank,

After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great 
tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.  Previously when 
interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of 
questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my 
organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.

Deal Number QW8614.3 was put in manually as a trade with Dynegy Canada. 
However, I looked in Enron Online and it says that the counterparty is Dynegy

Derek stopped by after he talked to his wife over the phone and it looks like 
he will probably take the job.  He wants to talk to her again tonite, and he 
will let me know officially tommorrow.  So he can let Joe Hunter know -- any 
idea on when they'll want him to start?

Hi Errol,

I understand you are having some trouble getting into the view on the sample 
option trade from this morning. AI'm able to get in, so I have attached 
screen prints of the trade and its auto-hedge.

Please verify that these are correct and let either Dawn and Tara or myself 
know..

Thanks,
Torrey

Cecillia,

When we choose FIMAT as a broker in Exchange Capture, we can not save a deal 
because the account number section is blank.  Could you please fix this as 
soon as possible.  Please call me with any questions at X5-8274.

Subject: Option Logic

Now that the tagg test environment is running, I have tested the option logic 
with the new NG-Exotic book.  Please review the following deals in tagg stage 
and let me know if this is correct.

QQ7966 Call Option
QQ7967 Hedge

If this is the way it should be booked in tagg, it is all contingent on Mike 
Maggi deleting the current option suites active on option manager, recreating 
them and selecting NG-Exotic as the risk book under the auto hedge 
selection.  We will be more than happy to provide assistance, if needed.  If 
you approve, we will place this logic into production this evening after 
trading.

If this does not look correct or if you have any further questions, please 
contact Dawn (3-9353) or Tara (3-4523).  

Thank you for your help!

Dawn

Everything looks correct, except for Friday, November 23, 2001.  Truong had 
this day listed as a holiday.  It is not a holiday -- the exchange will close

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane

Sharon,

I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with 
the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change 
an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We 
will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them 
from the Structuring group.

The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market 
quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.

I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Errol,
I noticed a small mistake late last night.  Their is West orig on your Orig 
schedule that is not 0.  It is already on the west schedule so the value just 
needs to be taken off your orig schedule tab.  

The cells that need to be set = to 0 are p41 and q41

thanks,
brad

Mark,

Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch 
Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal 
tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were 
included in the information picked up Friday.

I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the 
Management book (P&L, etc.) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 
713-853-0430.

Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book 
for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001.



I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as 
soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards 
details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not 
have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron.

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Hey, man would you let me know when it is done? Thanks!!!

Subject: NCAA tournament

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

Jeremy,

John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and 
Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in 
the system.  We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, 
but tonight we see that we don't.  John is about one half million dollars off 
every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid 
our position might not be correct as well.

Please give me a call.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Subject: Vega Issue - Vol. Smile

John:

The reason for the large Vega numbers on the TopPage report, while there were 
no corresponding changes in the Volatility curves, is due to the change in 
the mid. price for the current day versus the prior day. The corresponding 
volatility skews that are added to the vols. for the 2 days is causing the 
large vega numbers.

For example, for deal number QV5087.2 (exp. date 01-Jan-2002):

  Current Day  Prior Day
Mid. Price 5.885   5.772
Strike Price 3.5   3.5
Mid - Strike 2.385   2.272
Vol.  0.555   0.555
Vol. Skew 0.03816   0.03635
Actual Vol. 0.59316   0.59135

Option value for prior day using current day's vol. =  7,616,935  
Option value for prior day using prior day's vol.     =  7,547,238 
Vega                =  69,697

Thank you,
Jeremy

How are you doing?  I hope your day is going well.

Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember 
anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot 
that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and 
was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 
minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember 
picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm 
so sorry!).

Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.

Subject: Windows 2000 Migration for the RM-Finance and Administration 
Business Unit

I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system. 
Currently Jeff Gossett is our pilot for this business unit and is testing out 
all applications associated with your business unit.  We expect to migrate 
Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week (4/4 - 4/5)
As a former member of T.S.G. (TradeFloor Support Group - EB31/32) - I'm well 
aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with. 
Therefore, I would like to start the migration process first with visiting 
with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more 
than 10-15min. Profiling can begin as early as today- so here is what I ask 
of you: 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with your current location, the number of 
PC's you have and the number of screens/displays you have attached to each 
PC, as well a date/time that I can stop by. Being that most of you sit in the 
same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no 
more than a few days. *** 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.

that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=

to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20

the NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20
example, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa=

Dallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota=20

=09Hodges Mitchell =20
=09
=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=
our=20
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=
=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=
=20
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were "move=20
=09
=09 the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=
=20
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=
e=20
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=
=20
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=
=20
with opponent's wideouts.
=09
=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=
 all=20
over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=
s=20
up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20
Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=
n=20
anyone at UT block?
=09
=09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim=

=09?? Andrew Bowen=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=
's=20
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=
=20
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=
=20
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=
y=20
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=
d=20
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=
s,=20
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=

about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=
d=20
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=
he=20
team.=20
=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=

have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=

early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20
constructively or destructively.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=
. I=20

in=20
the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=

y=20
question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=

where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=

recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20
=09?? Ernie McAnally=20

=09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=

perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=
n=20
time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=

is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=

Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the 
others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for 
everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and 
Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.

Thanks -- I know it's a pain,

Greg,

Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal, nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap.  Deal QE 
7484 was changed to a NYMEX swap today and QE 9432 was changed on 01/04/2001.

Subject: Gas Daily deals in dispute

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

I had the same problems with this that you all do.  That is why I told 
Gossett that if this is something that has to happen, then only people like 
Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY.

It looks like Saturday, November 18 is the best day for this event. I have 
heard back from the East, Texas, Central and Benchmark groups as to how many 
players they will have. I still need to hear back from the West and Price 
desks about this date. Please let me know by the end of the week so that I 
may book the field.

Thanks,
Pat

The ERMS folder is out of disk space again.  I managed to free up again 2 to 
3gb about 2 weeks ago but we are back down to 450mb.  I found a folder that I 
would like to archive but I wanted to check with you first.  

o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999   

I would like to archive about 6 or 7 months out of this folder.  The oldest 7 
are Jan, May, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, and Aug.

Otherwise I don't know what else to archive?  I am open to suggestions.

This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily 
position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position 
instead of a February Index position.  I am currently working on  the problem 
and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.  John is aware of the 
situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.

Thanks,

Agustin,

Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is 
selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received 
a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and 
basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.

Thanks,

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane

I just saw you call.  John Arnold is on my phone so I couldn't pick up.  How

Harassment Avoidance FAQ

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A "Refresher Course" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months. 

It is important to note, that unless you've recieved a confirmation, you are 
not enrolled.  

All remaining questions or concerns need to be directed to David Foster 
(x.54360) or by email (david.foster@enron.com).

Sorry Dawn, QS7544 is not correct.  This deal is an option and is booked to

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Dawne,

I looked at the Gas Daily swaps and they look good.  QV0345 booked as a June 
deal instead of May 01.  The NYMEX swap booked with NXB2 as the expiration.  
If I'm not mistaken, the swaps should be NX1.  

Thanks,

Errol

Subject: Harassment Avoidance Seminar

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful

potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.

Jim,

I really appreciate the offer.  Sorry for the delay in responding - things 
have been a little crazy.  I would like to accept the tickets for myself.  
Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is 
interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things 
settle down.

Thanks,

The ERMS folder is out of disk space again.  I managed to free up again 2 to 
3gb about 2 weeks ago but we are back down to 450mb.  I found a folder that I 
would like to archive but I wanted to check with you first.  

o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999   

I would like to archive about 6 or 7 months out of this folder.  The oldest 7 
are Jan, May, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, and Aug.

Otherwise I don't know what else to archive?  I am open to suggestions.

Subject: EES Request

Sherry/Errol:

I just got a request from Todd Lambert at EES to retroactively do a trade for 
expired months.  The details are:

EES sold NYMEX gas contracts to a customer named Springs Industry for futures 
months October, November, and December 2000.

However they were not supposed to sell to the customer directly at that 
point.  He wants to know if we can work out a deal where he instead sold 
those contracts to us and then have us sell to the customer.

There would be no net position and we would just serve as a pass through for 
their deal.

I'll come by later today to see if we can do it.

Vikas

Deal NL3722 is a deal between ECC and another counterparty.  It is not a John 
Arnold deal.  You will have to contact Ryan in Canada re: this deal.

Thanks,

Please disregard the first e-mail I sent.  I am sorry for the confusion.  
This file has the correct positions, both NYMEX and OTC, that you requested.

Kam,

$100 sounds like a good idea.  I'm not close to a golfsmith, though. (sorry)

Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that 
Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in 
Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 
was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any 
questions.

Thanks,

The deals in the worksheet below have been flipped out.  In the future please 
cc: myself on any of these E-mails and I will make sure they are taken care 
of promptly.  In addition, Laura will be out until Feb. b/c of maternity 
leave and Sherry will be out through Monday -- she is stuck in Arkansas b/c 
of the ice storm there.

Thank you,

Subject: NG-Price deals needing to be flipped right away

Hi guys,

I took the liberty of looking in the NG-PRICE book to see if any deals were 
missed,
and came across a lot.  Here are the deals that need to be flipped to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book before 2:00pm Houston time as I need to get invoices
off to the customers today.



There are about 40 other deals in this book that still need to be dealt with 
for January
settlement, but these ones need to be fixed right away.  I've left a phone 
message with
Laura, but haven't heard back yet, and I think that Sherry is still out of 
the office as she
hasn't changed her outgoing message to say that she's in the office.

If there are any problems with this message, please let me know.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey

Jeff,

For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who 
accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps.  
The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In 
addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and 
credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that 
needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let 
them change those deals too.

On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in 
late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact 
of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, 
and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to 
settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and 
Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape 
letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.

We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that 
create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.

BT is no longer a valid counterparty (according to TAGG when you go into the 
deal).  One can not save a deal w/ an invalid c/p name in the deal.  Jennifer 
Blay is currently trying to get us the correct counterparty name.

Thanks, Errol

Errol-

There are two Bankers Trust Deals that you changed to Bankers Trust 
International. I pulled the trades from EOL and they say Bankers Trust. The 
Deal Nos are QT6916 and QT7116. Were these changed in error?

Thanks. Julie
