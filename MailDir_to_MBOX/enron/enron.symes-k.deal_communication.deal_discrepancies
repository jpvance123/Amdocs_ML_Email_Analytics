That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. 
Mike's exact words were, "there's no way it's $258." So if anyone from Prebon 
is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as 
$258.00 on this deal.
559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

I'm a little confused - 559066 is a Prebon deal under Mike Swerzbin's book. 
559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike 
Driscoll and he said these both have the correct brokers on them and there 
were two deals. ????

Yes this is the first time I've seen unrestricted Mid-C on any of their 
confirmations.  Normally they have into Mid-C on the confirmations which I 
know should be Mid-C excluding the into part.  Anyway, I will wait to clear 
this two deals.  Keep me informed.
Below is the two confirms they sent me.

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Also, Bloomberg sent over some confirmations for deal 595472 and 595473 and

as unrestricted Mid-C because if so it's not a selection currently.   Just

Thanks!
The holidays for me were really nice.  All my brothers were home so they kept 
me pretty busy.  But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours!  Happy New 
Year!
On another, not so exciting, note, I have another question about the EESI 
deal #481619.  I just spoke with Judy and they say that the price is supposed 
to be $145.00 not $145.05.  Can you check on that one?  It's the only one 
still hanging out there from the mess before the holidays.

Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

For the two deals traded on yesterday with Tom and Mark the fee is showing as 
$15.00 flat on both confirmations.  Can you send revisions.
The numbers are 20010416410003 and 20010416410002

Thanks

That is not the case. I know what Mark and Tom trade, I apologize if I
misspoke. All daily trades, as well as hourly trades will now be a flat fee
charge of $15 per trade. This covers any size transaction.

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

The confirmation is still coming over with 32 hours a day, but I can fix it 
to read 16 hours a day as long as it is valuing correctly for you guys in the 
calc.  This is very strange.  I don't know why it is coming over like that.  
Let me know if they get it fixed, or if this is something we are going to 
have to know about when strips are deleted and we prepare a confirmation.

Thanks!

I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

Thanks,

Hi Kate,

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

Thanks!!

That is not the case. I know what Mark and Tom trade, I apologize if I
misspoke. All daily trades, as well as hourly trades will now be a flat fee
charge of $15 per trade. This covers any size transaction.

Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. 
Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

I talked to Diana Scholtes last night about this deal, and she looked at it 
this afternoon. She says the deal is definitely not entered correctly, but 
because it was done for the days when we got hit with transmission cuts, she 
wants to look into it a little further before she changes or kills it. She 
said she'd reconcile it tomorrow, and we'll let you know what we've done then.

Thanks for your patience,

Hello, I think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy 
resale instead of as transmission.  There are not any other transmission 
deals in the system with this counterparty.  If you would not mind looking 
into this and letting me know I would appreciate it.

540039, 541695, 541715, and 541737 are booked to Enmax Corporation.  I think 
they should be booked to Enmax Energy Corporation.  Wendy Conwell in credit

entity.  Can you check?

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Subject: Montana power

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

Hi Kate, Deal # 509086.01 is still in the system at the PX index instead of 
the Dow Jones SP-15 index.  This trade was done on January 30, 2001.  We just 
received the new index language from Steve Hall in Portland.  I was going to 
confirm this trade but it has the old index.  There is another deal done the 
same day that has been changed (509087) to the new index.  I know some of the 
deals that are not flowing have not been changed because Bob Badeer is still 
negotiating with the counterparties.  Is this one that can be changed since 
it started flowing Feb 1?

Let me know,

Thanks,
Melissa

just to be sure.  i am always usually in such a hurry when i talk to you.  
but, since it has slowed down a bit......i wanted to let you know you are 
doing a wonderful job, and you really are a pleasure to work with.  again i 
am sorry if it seems like i am always in a rush, just tell me to chill out.

To all:

I ran a minibook valuing the Merced correction (as of yesterday's curves), 
and confirmed that the LTNW book will lose approximately $6.8MM in value 
after the calc today.  This reverses the $7MM gain that was incorrectly shown 
in the LTNW book on yesterday's DPR.  Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

This was a futures contract done by Matt Motley, and I entered the forward 
deal. I wasn't aware that futures deals don't get confirmed. I only knew that 
when the contract expires, I need to enter a forward deal in EnPower to hold 
the trader's position. It looks like you've already added a comment about the 
trade going physical off of the NYMEX. Is there anything else you'd like me 
to add? If not, I'll just make a note in the comments section of forward 
deals entered in place of expiring futures contracts, and I'll mark "no 
confirm" on these deals as well.

Hello, 563928 is a deal that went physical off of the NYMEX.  I am not sure 
who entered the trade but if we could get you all to put a comment saying the 
trade went physical off of the NYMEX that would help us alot.  We do not 
confirm these trades.  We sent a confirm out to the counterparty for this 
trade and referenced the incorrect contract.

Thanks for your help,

Kate I will have to submit a code change to our Enpower guys to reflect the 
$15.00 flat fee change for 1 or 2 days deals.  Currently this can't be coded 
based on the duration of these deals because we currently have a code for 
daily deals(meaning 1 day only) and a code for short term deals ( meaning 
anything 1 day or more but less than 1 month) and a code for long term deals 
(meaning anything more than 1 month).   If the fee was per mw, I could simply 
go and edit the broker table fee but since this is a flat fee, the codes have 
to be adjusted to reflect such.

I have submitted a request and I am waiting on a response.  I will keep you 
updated.

Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Caroline,

Deal #420886 legs 3-7 have no price attached to the deal.  Would you please
add the DJPV index plus an offset of 5%.  On legs 2 & 8 the offset needs to
be changed from $5.00 to 5%.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
Katrina

No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having

a conversation about this in a minute when I come up for air from this whole 
California mess. In the meantime, I've changed this to Enron Energy Services,

Please check this deal.  It is booked under Coral for transmission.  We don't 
have a transmission contract with Coral and we don't usually sell 
transmission.  Let me know.

Kate,

 for ref 490710 ( Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the 
broker is showing Enron as the seller and Sempra as the buyer.

for ref 490640 (Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the broker 
is showing Enron as the buyer and Sempra as the seller

Can you check with Mike and verify this because I confirmed this differently 
with Prebon.

Thanks!!

They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

please Check that Deal_Schedule_yn flag to no on this.  

We need to fix the underlying bug when we get a chance.  I think it is more 
related to the cross desk deals done with EPMI LT WMGMT instead of EOL

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks for the phone list.  Kimberly Hundl is soooo jealous!

Kate, could you ask Matt Motley if he did this trade Monday or Tuesday. 
Powerex says Monday and we show Tuesday.

These deals have shown up on the not to be confirmed report.  Do we confirm 
them?  I am sorry there are so many of them, but with the new policy of 
confirming west daily trades, we are having a hard time figuring out just 
what should be confirmed.

The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter 
before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, 
Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

I just heard back from Jeff on these deals - apparently he's hiding his trade 
log now to keep his secrets safe! Well that didn't work too well for us 
today, because the two missing deals were right there at the bottom....with 
no deal numbers! Anyway, Jeff said he'd enter these in the morning, and if 
you hear anything from Prebon in the meantime, these are good deals.

Kate I spoke with Phil about this deal this morning and I just called but he 
away at lunch.

Per our Rhonda, can you tell him that deal 553645 should be changed Allegheny 
Energy Supply and that we should no longer do any deals under Merrill Lynch.  
Also, can you let the schedulers know about the name change of this deal. 


Thanks!

They need to choose the company that has the (US) in it.  Let me know.

Yes, please change to be confirmed.  The only thing you might need to do is 
tell the schedulers because you might get a message that warns that you will 
unroute this deal.  They just need to know about it.  Let me know.

wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 
transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be 
Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check 
and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales?  
Thanks.

This deal is against the NP index with an SP del point.  Is that what you 
want?

Thanks!

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Hope you had a great holiday!
These EES deals were all changed by Carla so they're all in "Pending 
-Revised..." status in the system.  It looks like Carla made some changes, 
but then changed it back.  Can you please ask her if we need to send revised 
confirms on any of these deals.

I've handed this over to Jeff Richter, who will speak with his contact at 
Aquila to sort this out. We were both confused about the discrepancy, 
however, because if the deal didn't exist there would have been problems in 
scheduling on Oct. 12; and so far we haven't heard anything. I'm sorry this 
didn't get taken care of more quickly, but Jeff was in a meeting this 
afternoon.

Thanks,

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Thanks!

Do you know what ever happened with this price? I never received a new 
confirmation with the price of $90 from FPL.

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new

They just had it as 12/5/00 in the system and with the deal being done 
direct, it is tough to have proof from my end when the deal was done.   Is 
this okay?  We just ensure the trade dates match up so it will ease the end 
of month check out, to make sure there was not more then one deal out there 
that it could be confused with.  But the deal on our end was done on 12/6/00 
correct?
thanks
Stephanie

Thanks for keeping me up to date. Out of curiosity, do you know why El Paso 
changed the trade date in the first place?

Kate, 
just fyi, El Paso struck thru our 12/6/00 trade date and placed 12/5/00.  I 
spoke to Chi, of El Paso and he said the 12/6/00 was okay.  I just made a 
note on the confirm and sending it to the fileroom to be executed.
Thanks
Stephanie

And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when 
they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by 
using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't 
exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm 
not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the 
information at their disposal. If they don't, or won't, let me know and I'll 
have our traders talk to them.

Thanks for your help,

Can you verify with Mark that there were two identical trades done on Jan 8, 
2001

Enron Sells Southern California Edison
100 mws
sp-15
165.00
jan 10-31, 2001

We received an executed confirmation letter from the cp but the deal number 
is not avaliable (the fax machine cut off the deal number)  {just collecting 
all the confirms for the California situation.}

the deal numbers I have located are 492137.01, 492152.01
Just making sure  one is not a duplicate.

Geir and Bill,

OK,

At MidC we are -2 on LLH,  we also show a 2 mw buy from MPC at Hotsprings.  
If we used transmission for this, we need to put it in.  Did you use our 
existing Benton?

Then all that we will have left is 16 mw's open for HE 23-24 at MPC system,  
and 2 mw's for the same hours at Mid C (SCL deal)

I reduced the EPMICALPOOL deals by an equal amount, and that gets us balanced 
all the way.

I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I 
noticed that the one you asked about, #481620, was part of an EES sleeve, so 
I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the 
incorrect energy type. It's holiday fever!

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
up.

Thanks,

This deal is in "Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty" status.  Some 
changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point 
with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or 
the energy type that is wrong?

There is an hourly trader named Geir Solberg whose trades appear on our 
reports to be confirmed.  We go into each trade and change them to not to be 
confirmed.   The other hourly deals do not appear on these reports.  I think 
perhaps his defaults are not set correctly.  Can you check with him on this. 
I don't know why his are appearing on the reports and not other hourly deals.

Thanks!

Kate:

Can you please modify that deal that you made the price $140 yesterday to 
make it for the 6th only?  The 7th is all at $150.

Thanks

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

the broker does not show these trades twice, already confirmed deals 534167

Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

Hi Kate, 

Can you please let Phil know that he should be testing deals in the enpower 
test database not the actual system.  

Thanks

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

Thanks,

Sharen,
I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

Kate,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880, 
523883, and 523884



Thanks!!

Subject: Re: 2/15 Bloomberg Checkout  

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

Thanks,

I just spoke with Jesse Bryson in Real Time, and he said this should actually 
be 2 buy-resales - one from Four Corners to ZP-26, and one from ZP-26 to 
NP-15. Let me know how that sounds to you, and I'll enter the deals.

Thanks,
Kate

Should this be NCPA, since we do not have transmission with them.  Or maybe 
it should be a buy/resale.  let me know.  Thanks.

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

Carla

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Thanks!

Hi Kate,
We had a deal with Hinson Power Company, Inc. yesterday that we ended up not 
confirming because the comments said that it was a buy-back of part of a 
one-off deal and that Legal would prepare a special confirm.  There are no 
comments entered for these deals that would indicate that they are the same 
type of deal.  Are they?  Should we prepare a confirm letter?
Thanks!
Kim

I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Kate, 
Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do 
not see it in system, although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I 
receive daily.
the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date 
1/8/01  Matt Motley trader

I've forwarded this e-mail to Christian and Greg. Unfortunately, the 
population of the office is quickly dwindling as the holidays come near. I've 
been told that one or the other of them will be in today, and I'll find out 
if something has been sent out already, and if not, how soon we can do that. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I talk to them.

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!
Kim

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as 
Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should 
it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde 
and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15.

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Hello, 563928 is a deal that went physical off of the NYMEX.  I am not sure 
who entered the trade but if we could get you all to put a comment saying the 
trade went physical off of the NYMEX that would help us alot.  We do not 
confirm these trades.  We sent a confirm out to the counterparty for this 
trade and referenced the incorrect contract.

Thanks for your help,
Melissa

checkout today and promise them another cookie tomorrow if they get their

Wow! That's so exciting to see the words "clean checkout" associated with OUR 
beloved brokers and traders. Thanks for your persistence with all of this - I 
know it gets frustrating. Please let me know whenever I can help - I'm trying 
to respond quickly to the e-mails coming from Houston confirms, but in the 
interest of accuracy I'm also trying to be thorough. So feel free to give me

Kate,

to cover my you know what.....this will be the new daily checkout for all of 
my brokers.  I am sending this to ensure a quality checkout to minimize any 
risks associated with our transactions.  Even if I don't have any errors I 
will still send a summary everyday of my checkouts for the west deals.  We 
have had several deals pop up from the brokers that we didn't know about and 
did not verbal the day of the trade and this will serve as proof of the 
previous days checkout. 


Amerex West Checkout 
No errors- Clean Checkout


Prebon West Checkout
No errors-Clean Checkout


Bloomberg Checkout

Thanks!!

If its just an internal move, then it doesn't get paid as far as I

These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

Prebon agrees now because the confirm is exactly what we have, however, can 
you change both strips to reflect 3/15-3/31 in enpower (deal 549052).

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Kate

This deal is in "Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty" status.  Some 
changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point 
with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or 
the energy type that is wrong?
Thanks for your help!

I have a question about how this deal is entered.  You have it entered as 
every day of the week including Sundays and Holidays for the hours 7 -22.  I 
think that will duplicate the off peak hours you have entered for Sundays on 
#533134.  It is already flowing Sundays, 24 hours on #533134.  Is this in 
addition to those hours or is it a duplication?

Also, do you want these two confirmed on one letter or as two separate 
deals.  If together, please put a note in the comment section of deal entry 
sp we will know to confirm both on one letter.

Thanks!

Let's start over: 


ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
deal 524248 and deal 524266
This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.


ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.


This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

Thanks
Evelyn

I've changed deals 581499 and 581605 to Sierra Pacific Power. They're suposed 
to be transmission deals, they were just in with the wrong counterparty name. 
And thanks again for working so hard to finalize this Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. thing.

Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 
transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be 
Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check 
and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales?  
Thanks.

This is to summarize our previous discussion:

EPMI took an assignment of ALL EEMC's (an affiliate of EES) deals with PG&E 
Energy Trading  - Power, L.P. (PGET) whereby EPMI is now buying all of the 
power from PGET.
EPMI then acts as "sleeve" for EES and sells the power to EES with a $.05 
sleeve fee
With respect to the specific EEMC deal # ACW672, EEMC originally was buying 
75MW from PGET at a price of $29.90.
After taking over EEMC's portfolio, EPMI, PGET and Avista Energy entered into 
a 3-party assignment, assumption and settlement agreement whereby EPMI and 
AvistaEnergy "took out" PGET of the picture for 50MW of the 75MW piece.
By doing so, EPMI thus is buying 50MW from Avista Energy and the remaining 
25MW still from PGET
The new 50MW piece from Avista Energy results in a purchase price of $29.80 
and a sale price of $29.85 to EES.  [the reason for the price decrease is 
because when we entered into the 3-party agreement, in order to "take out" 
PGET we had to pay them their profit in that deal stream ie monetizing their 
spread of $.10 per MW]
The remaining 25MW piece from PGET kept the SAME PRICING of $29.90 since we 
left that 25MW block alone.

If you have any additional questions, please call me.

it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.

This deal is in under Short Term California, not Long Term Northwest, and the 
trader is Phil Platter, not Mike Swerzbin, and there is no broker. Are you 
sure this is the deal in question?

Kate, for deal 297846 (Mike Swerzbin) Prebon says the broker fee should be

Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he 
said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May?

When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.

Thanks!

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

We are researching this deal and need your help.

Could you take a look at this deal?  I've pulled the audit viewer and the 
deal tickets.  My real question is - what deal do we actually have 
confirmed?  Leg 3 was the deal we carried on our books that had the expiry in 
March.  Since Modesto did not exercise, we realized a rather small fortune 
and want to make sure it was a real deal.  

I think we do not want to contact our counterparty but we do want to pull the 
deal records for confirm.  Can you help?

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

I show now two Smurfit Deals,

403522 for 25 flat, at 54.65,    and 246859.1 for 15  hlh, AND 25 hlh,   and 
246859 for 15 llh AND 25 llh.

I have zeroed out the 25's from 246859 in Scheduling, and we are flat now.  I 
did not change it in the deal because we were calcing, and I want to check 
with Diana first before doing it.

What I show in Scheduling is a sale to Smurfit for 40 mw flat, which is what 
is actually scheduled

Chris,
Good morning!  Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on 
was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal 
#576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/2001) according to APX's 
statement (not including 4/7/2001).  Therefore, the entire offpeak for your 
deal would be booked on Deal #572069.1 for the $150 price for 4/7/2001.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,
One more quick thing on 4/6/2001- APX is showing 2 different prices for 
offpeak ($140 & $150 - different MW per strip).  EPMI is showing $150 @ 12/MW 
per offpeak hours.  This difference amounts to a $144 difference (APX has 
lower invoice).  Can you verify?  Everything else is fine....talk to you next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
peak hours.  Which one is it?

Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Thanks!

I see several sales to Puget in Diana's blotter at a $375 price, only one 
with Amerex, and it's for 50 MW. I'll need to get ahold of her in the morning 
to verify the brokers on these. I'll let you know as soon as I do.

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows 
one off-peak deal like this and it is our reference 499390.

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Thanks,

Hello-
Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm 
energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, 
we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP 
15, and Zp 26 delivery points only.

Thank you

Kate, 
I received a call from Tricia Allen of Tacoma, and she was inquiring about 
two deals that happened yesterday:  Deal 491893.01, she agrees with
Deal 491916.01 she does not agree with  
I left her a message that they showed as good deals in our system and she 
called back and said she does not agree with Deal 491916.01.   Can you check 
with Sean Crandall and have the two traders talk. 
Thanks

checked with broker - Tom Alonso did not do this deal - Jeff Richter did a 
similar one but it is with Williams, not Reliant......???
CP is Reliant......you are correct


Jeff Richter
closest deal I can see is 569178 - all same terms except it's at NP not SP
Broker did say SP-15 but sent confirm over as NP-15....you are correct

Thanks!!

Subject: Re: 586775  

I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems 
valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average. So 
to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal 
each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the 
expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and 
putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775. Each day Heather will 
take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll 
average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day 
average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - 
doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's 
just split between two deals temporarily. 

Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another 
comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should 
be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any 
point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward 
deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value 
properly.

Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you 
more than less!

Thanks,
Kate

Can you check and see why we are not confirming this deal with Deseret?  It 
is on the not to be confirmed list.

I have changed the Index Multiplier for all of the days in January.  The days 
that were not at a mulitplier of 1.05 have been changed to that amount. Also, 
there was no deal in for 1/9, and 2 identical deals for 1/10.  I modified one 
of the 1/10 days to the 1/9 amount.

I will begin autoscheduling these shortly so the price will show.

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Kate

Hi Kate, Stephanie Checkout with Prebon because I was out last week and I am 
still trying to clear up some deals from the 14th.   The west checkout person

these discrepancies.

This deal is entered as 7 - 22, every day of the week.  Usually it is 7 -22, 
M - S or 1 -24, every day of the week.  Can you check into this and let me

We are long in Enpower for tomorrow due to a parking arrangement with EPE at 
PV.     We added this deal late,  so make sure that the EPE dispatcher knows 
of this late preschedule of energy to EPE.
We are long the following hours/mws:

He 7-10    3mw's
He 11-22     10mw's

The length is reflected on deal #476644 and this energy should be marketed 
hourly.    We need to communicate early with EPE and make sure that this goes 
as smoothly  as possible.     Once sold,  of course enter the sale( under ST 
SW book)  and route to the length.
This deal is completely ST SW in Enpower and we will share any profits with 
ST SW.

Thanks,
JMF

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

Hi Kate!
This deal has a strange delivery point -ZP-26.  Is that right?  It might be, 
but it's just strange, so I thought I'd ask.

Amerex shows this deal once and Mike Swerzbin shows it twice ref 477089 and

Judy at EES has different totals for these two deals.  For #498865 at NP15, 
she has total volume of 13,319.  For #497869 at SP15 she has a total volume 
of 8516.6.  Do you know of any reason that these total volumes would be 
different than what EES is showing?

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,

I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Can you have Mike double check the volume for the Sierra Pacific deal.  I 
looked back over my notes and I put 25 then I put 50.

Thanks!!

This should have said $1,728 for August.  Sorry.  kyle

Cara, thanks.  All the deals look good.  However, if at all possible, we 
really need to have annuities to reflect each months activity.  In order for 
each months activity to be correctly booked into SAP, we need it divided out 
this way.  Right now it looks like we have $4,928 for September.  We need it 
to show $1600 for Spetember and July and $1,728 for July.  Thanks.  Kyle

The annuity amount is reflective of the charge for the entire deal, the date 
is just the day it was put in the system.  If you multiply the volume of leg 
1 by .05, the amount of the annuity is the result.

The AutoScheduling for the July pieces is now done.  

360937.1  for 7/1-7/31
360940.1  for 7/10 - 7/31
360943.1 for 7/8 - 7/31

360940.1  for 7/10 - 7/31
360943.1 for 7/8 - 7/31

We also need to enter annuities for the two purchases to reflect the 5 cent 
charge for July and August.  There has already been an annuity entered for 
September.

Diana, we really need to get these deals fixed this week.  Joy cannot 
checkout with PGET and I cannot check out with EES for July or August until 
these deals are fixed.  Just as a reminder, PGET needs to have the price 
zeroed out from July 1 forward.  EES needs to have the price zeroed out, 
except for the 5 cent offset, for July 1 forward.  Currently, July 1 - Aug 21 
still have prices in them.  We also need to have the 5 cent offset corrected 
for EES on our purchase side (the offset is going the worng way).  Please 
call me to let me know what we can do to ensure this change takes place this 
week.  Thank you.  Kyle 3-7579

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?

This deal with Colorado River Commission is for calendar 2002.  We were told 
that we may need to enter special CAISO language for deals that extent past 
April 2002, but that the traders should be entering comments to indicate 
this.  Does Mike want us to include this language in the confirm letter for 
this deal?
Thanks for your help!
Kim

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

Brain glitch!  It was two legs of the same deal!

I also found #550042 and 550048 that look like it needs to be confirmed also.

Thanks!

I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: Not to be confirmed deals

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
me if you need to interpret this message!

Kate, I think Tom Alonso entered this trade under the wrong counterparty. I 
think it should be FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power and 
Light. I received a confirm from FPL Energy Marketing for this trade. Can you 
as Tom and then change in system if I am correct.

Thanks for your help!

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Power Marketing. They are in right now as FP&L. I have received confirms on 
these as FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please check on and update in 
ENPOWER. #516506.01, 517518.01, 517520.01.

Hi Kate,
I called Seattle City Light to verbally confirm this deal and they said that 
it should be Off Peak.  I spoke with Matt Motley who agreed.  Can you change 
this deal to Off-Peak hours?  If you want to check with Matt, that's fine.  
We're not supposed to make any changes to West deals otherwise I'd do it 
myself.
Thanks!

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly

Hi Kate, Lindy Conrad a trader from Seattle City Light called me today.  She 
thinks the price for deal # 537565.01 should be $360.00 instead of $350.00.  
She said that Sean Crandall was our trader.  

Let me know what you find out.
Thanks,
Melissa

Kate, This is a Tom Alonso trade. For these two trades they are entered as 
Florida Power & Light. FPL Energy Power Marketing sent a confirmation over on 
this trade. Could you ask Tom if he entered the trade incorrectly for both 
deal numbers. Secondly on #570450 the confirmation shows a price of $80. We 
have $85.00 in the system. Which one is correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly

Hi Kate, I know you are working on this problem.  This deal will not let me 
save it because it wants the schedule type filled in.  Let me know if there 
is a schedule type I can choose or if I should just wait until the problem is 
fixed.

it.  Let me know.

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Hello, Sierra Pacific Power Company called me and they don't recognize this 
trade.  Could it possibly be with another counterparty?

Thanks,

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Thanks!

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Thanks!

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Thanks!

He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but

Jeff,
Here is a spreadsheet with prices and deal #'s for yesterday.  We couldn't 
get the energy out of NP, and really didn't get a decent price for it in 
NP-15.
All the deals are flat for your book.  Wish we could have done better.  If 
you have questions, just let me know.
Thanks, 
Bill

Kate, 
#562373 was an EOL trade that Chris Mallory did. When it was done on line the 
delivery point was NP-15 now in Enpower it has been changed to SP-15. Could 
you check with Chris if this is correct. I thought that we were not allowed 
to change EOL trades. If he did then I will have to get with Legal to find 
out what our next step would be.

Thanks,

Kimberly

Yes, these are deals 478198 and 478199. Both are entered under Natsource, and 
should be for Q1-01. 478199 was entered with the wrong price (165.05). It 
should be 164.95, and I'll change it when the Risk girls are done with their 
calc.

This is a Tom Alonso deal; and it's for heavy load, and since 12/31 is a 
Sunday, the term will actually end on 12/30. I can change the end date in 
deal entry if that makes things less complicated; but either way the deal 
will end on the 30th. Please let me know.

Audrey,

Concerning deal #579038:  This was a mistake on my part, the price should in 
fact be $80 (as the APX is showing).  I've fixed the price in Enpower.

Concerning deal #581335:  This trade did take place between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Industries (not the APX).  I mistakenly put that deal in under the 
wrong counterparty.  I've fixed the counterparty in Enpower.

I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals.  Let me know if I need to 
do anything further.

Thanks,
Stan

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

Subject: Re: contacts  

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

Subject: Deal Changes - No confirm

Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these 
deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard 
time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page 
and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no 
confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:

1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask 
Jeff?

2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"

3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the 
counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?

4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed 
deals as well?

Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or 
if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. 
Thanks for your help!

Kate

I've never seen anything but a .005 broker fee on Bloomberg deals. Tom Alonso 
wanted to know when that fee changed.......we're confused!

And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on 
their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade 
needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with 
EPMI. Let me know if you still have problems with this.

Thanks,

Yes the fee is $15.00 Flat per Bloomberg's confirmation on both of these

Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do. Is that going to fly with 
Prebon?
I guess this is o.k. but they were insisting that this deal was done with 
Matt not Bob.

I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

Hello, can you check these deals and see if the counterparty name is wrong.  
They are in as Enmax Corporation and we are wondering if they should be Enmax 
Energy Corporation.  The contract did not come over correctly so we wanted to 
make sure the counterparty name is correct before we set up a new contract.

Thanks,
Melissa

Hi Kate, I just changed deal # 473100 from Monday through Friday to Monday 
through Saturday.  This deal was manually entered by us because it failed the 
EOL bridge.  When we manually entered it the wrong days were chosen.  I have 
fixed it and we will send a revised confirm to the counterparty.  I am not 
sure if you normally tell risk when you make a change.  

Thanks,
Melissa

This deal was done on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Jeff thought it 
was the same thing as Dynegy Direct. I've changed it to ICE as broker, but 
I'm wondering if these are different brokers, or why Jeff would have thought 
they were the same....???

Is Dynegy Direct the correct broker because I do not see this deal on their 
web checkout?

Kate, 
I called Alicia Izarraraz from Atlantic to verbal trades and she was 
inquiring about the term of trade, May delivery, she thought they were going 
to be for April delivery. Deals 576274.01, 576275.01.  Kate, can you ask 
Chris to call regarding inquiry.  Her cell phone is 949-637-4878, her desk 
number 562-499-3201 she said she will be out if the office soon.  No broker, 
done direct.
Thanks

These are deals for Jeff Richter traded 11-09-00 and the correct name should 
be Calpine Energy Services, L.P.   Please change the names and let the 
traders know that they should now be choosing this name instead of Calpine

Kate, I am working with Brooklyn Couch with EES on the March power activity 
and she has a deal referring to the schedule received from you.  Deal  # 
547478.1 we have peak @ $164.15, off peak @ $99.90.   EES shows per the 
schedule $174.15 & $109.90.

I spoke with Virginia and we agreed that variances which are listed as part 
of the schedule I will forward to you.  All others will go in to DMS.

Please let me know what you find out.

Thanks,

Mark

Hi Kate,
A few quesions about this one.  Why is it no confirm?  Why is it entered so 
funny (instead of just entering off-peak hours, it was entered strip by strip 
for sundays, which makes it come over really strange on the confirm.) It's 
not necessarily wrong, but whoever entered it needs to know that there's a 
much easier way to enter off-peak deals.  And finally, who is the contact?
Thanks so much for your help!  Hope you had a great weekend!
Kim

Kate,

to cover my you know what.....this will be the new daily checkout for all of 
my brokers.  I am sending this to ensure a quality checkout to minimize any 
risks associated with our transactions.  Even if I don't have any errors I 
will still send a summary everyday of my checkouts for the west deals.  We 
have had several deals pop up from the brokers that we didn't know about and 
did not verbal the day of the trade and this will serve as proof of the 
previous days checkout. 


Amerex West Checkout 
No errors- Clean Checkout


Prebon West Checkout

Thanks!!

Kate, I think these trades are suppose to be FPL Energy Power Marketing in 
Enpower. Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light. I received 
confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please talk to 
Mallory about the counterparty name.

Thanks!

That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

Prebon just sent over a confirm where Mike Swerzbin:
buys from EES 25 mw of Q2'01 Palo off-peak at $124.95.


Is this a good deal because they did not tell me about it?

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

Kimberly

NP-15. Let me know how that sounds to you, and I'll enter the deals.

Mirant checkout)

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

Thanks!

Happy Holidays!

We have a few problems with deals with EES.  We have tried to get them 
straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.  
Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and 
they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.

Deal #481619 should be $145.00 even.  The trader says the deal was done 
direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge

Deal # 480433 should be killed.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for 
the same hours.  This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount 
that flows that day which is 400.

Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas, ya' hear!

I have a question about how this deal is entered.  It is a 24 hour deal 
against an index.  Shouldn't it be split out and priced against the 
individual on peak, off peak and Sunday index?

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
me if you need to interpret this message!

Hi Kate!
I have two deals that extent past April 2002 (Deal #478879 & #478878).  The 
traders didn't enter any comments about special CAISO language to be 
entered.  Will you ask them if they want us to enter that language?
Thanks!
Kim

Kate, we have created the confirm that represented the original deal.  Total 
400 mws, we have sent the confirm to Idaho, broker confirm matches original 
deal, Melissa said we usually do not reconfirm deals that were cut.  We have 
put a comment in deal entry commenting that the deal was cut.  Just as long 
as you have all recorded on your side, with the mws.  Hope this helps.   
Thanks Sp

Subject: Re: Deal 565759.01  

I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but 
I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out 
what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the 
Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So 
Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market. 

Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better 
if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal was a sleeve done for EES, and we've had problems with the trade 
dates on these before. EES reported this trade to us on 12/6/00, and it was 
Matt Motley's understanding that the trade was executed the previous day. He 
doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe 
Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date.

In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be 
best? E-mail or call and let me know.

Thanks a lot!

Those are east trades and you probably don't have access to them.  I just 
bundled west and east so you can ignore them.

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Thanks!

 for ref 490710 ( Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the 
broker is showing Enron as the seller and Sempra as the buyer.

for ref 490640 (Mike Swerzbin) Prebon just sent over a confirm and the broker 
is showing Enron as the buyer and Sempra as the seller

Can you check with Mike and verify this because I confirmed this differently 
with Prebon.

They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Hi Kate,
Just checking on this deal.  Is this gonna be an exchange for physical and 
the counterparty name will be added later?  It's been "new" for a couple of 
days now, which is fine, I just wanted to make sure someone is working on it.
Thanks,
Kim

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Kate, please ask Sean Crandell if the following deals need the "special 
phrase" ..The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Transaction is 
connected with the transaction referenced in Deal No. 347356.1 entered into 
between the Parties on May 31, 2001.

Jack Wells of Conoco called and said that the phrase should be included in 
confirmations: 506549.01..506550.01..506551.01 and 507417.01 and 507430.01.  
Please ask trader if deals are related to the 347356.01.  Sharen has inquired 
once before and we were under the impression that the deals were separate and 
not included.  Please let us know.

Thanks

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.

These two deals do not have contacts but are coded to be confirmed.  Can you 
check and see if she does want them to be confirmed and if so, please add 
contacts.

We are still planning on confirming the daily deals in the west, but we have 
run into system problems so we have pushed the start date back a little.  
I'll let you know when we have a definite date.

Hello

Spoke to Tom, had to change CP from Pinnacle West Cap Corp to Arizona Public 
Service Co
Bloomberg cannot handle two names in their system, in process of changing.

Thanks
Stephanie

Attached is the FINAL report for Nov 2000.  The additions to the preliminary 
report have been highlighted.

Please note that on the preliminary report for this month, Sempra Energy 
Solutions, LLC  ("Solutions") was listed under old record information to be 
inactivated on 12/01/00, and Sempra Energy Sales LLC  ("Sales") was listed as 
the new record information.  For the documentation received, this information 
was correct, HOWEVER, there was a subsequent change for which there is no 
documentation.  I have verified with the Counterparty that "Sales" was a 
fictiticious name used to distinguish the Kentucky office from the California 
office.  Through reorganization, it was decided that both offices would use 
the "Solutions" name.  Since "Solutions" already existed and "Sales" is a 
fictitious name, they had no documentation to support that change.  The 
"Sales" record has been suspended pending inactivation on 12/01.







All short name changes will be made this afternoon, approx. 1:p CST, Nov. 
22.  


Records will be inactivated on Fri afternoon, Dec. 1.


Thanks,

Cheryl x3-3103


HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!!

Matt doesn't have any trade like this for 1/8. I spoke with Judy at EES, and 
she's going to have Jubran call Matt to duke it out over whether or not this 
is a good trade. I'll let you know what those guys decide. 

Thanks,

Kate, 
Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do 
not see it in system, although I see the deal on EES spreadsheet that I 
receive daily.
the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date 
1/8/01  Matt Motley trader
then Enron Sell EES  Q4 2001  25mws   $255.05

Should this be in the system and if so do you have deal numbers on the 
above.  I believe we sleeved the deal for EES and Pwx.  
Contact at EES, Judy (backoffice 7138535490)  Jubran Whalen is EES trader.

Thanks

Can you please get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty from 
Mike Swerzbin as soon as possible? -I need to get a verbal confirm on this 
deal so that we can send out the confirmation letter and the number we have 
in the system has been disconnected.  Also, we're checking on that other deal 
that I asked you about yesterday (I thought we confirmed it under the 
original deal # so I wasn't sure if we needed to confirm it again)
Thanks!

This is a unit contingent deal.  We have been told that we have to have the 
unit name to include in the confirmation when we confirm these deals.  Can 
you have the traders add the unit name in the comment section whe they do 
unit contingent deals?

Thanks!

I didn't realize Diana and Valerie are working on this with Sharen here in

it was an expiry date, he thought it was exercised upon daily, just double

This deal looks to me like it needs to be confirmed, but it was marked no 
confirm.  Do you know of a reason why it shouldn't be confirmed?  If not, I 
need a contact name so that i can send out a letter on it.

it is a certain guy that checks out at natsource, sometimes i wonder about 
him.  and the thing of it is, is that if they knew it wasn't ours, why didn't 
he call to tell me.  they don't care......thats just the way it goes with 
those brokers.  thanks again.

Natsource is going to have to give you a trader name on this because I've 
asked all of them and nobody recognizes it.

Kate, could you ask Tom if this transaction is suppose to be Firm in Enpower. 
Their confirmation says Non-Firm, Transmission Contingent. Could you ask him 
which is correct?

Hi Kate,

I think Mike traded  deal 516618 late because I did not confirm this deal 
with Prebon yesterday.
Prebon shows 16mw and Enpower has 10mw.

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!

This is the other side of the EES sleeve - Prebon gave Mike these prices, and 
he couldn't get ahold of them tonight, so we'll check in the morning.

If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to 
prepare a confirmation under this name.  If this is not ok, let me know.

Thanks!

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

Kate,

these are the following deals I have amended the time zones to PPT instead of 
PST and amended the strips to reflect the change:
534066
534473
534077
534078
534064
534058

Also, these are only the brokered deals between Tom and Mark.  There may be 
some non-brokered deals in enpower with a flow of April and the time zone 
needs to be changed to PPT and the strips amended as well.  Can you please 
run a query and check the other deals to make sure the time zone is correct 
because if not they will not be scheduled correctly for April. 

If you have any question please call me.  


Thanks!!

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the 
strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as 
$258.00 on this deal.
559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

Come to me first, and I can help you sort it out from there.  The only stuff 
that I have no clue about is the traders intra-book swaps.

Thank you! 

The itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when I can 
do things like that to make your job go more smoothly. I know the market got 
chaotic late yesterday; so I probably could have assumed that our net 
position would be off today and at least one other person would know that. 
But it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to 
breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line. So I 
thought I'd ask. In the future, is it you I should come to, or real time?

Thanks again for your help.

Kate

They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

This deal is part of a sleeve - we bought Powerex at 145.00 and sold EES at 
145.05. This is standard procedure for these kinds of deals, said the guys at 
the Long Term Northwest desk. They're positive that the deal should include a 
5-cent charge on the sale side; and Mike Driscoll said if EES still disputes 
this, they can call him to verify.

Please let me know if this deal continues to be a problem.

Thanks,
Kate

The holidays for me were really nice.  All my brothers were home so they kept 
me pretty busy.  But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours!  Happy New 
Year!
On another, not so exciting, note, I have another question about the EESI 
deal #481619.  I just spoke with Judy and they say that the price is supposed 
to be $145.00 not $145.05.  Can you check on that one?  It's the only one 
still hanging out there from the mess before the holidays.

Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!

These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - 
Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. 
(This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to 
let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days. Sorry 
about the hassle. I promise I'll get the hang of this soon!

Can you check and make sure this is the correct counterparty on this deal?  
We did a deal in February (#533916) with a little different name.  Also we 
will need a counterparty contact.

Kate,
Amerex has a deal on their web checkout traded by Diana on 2/14 where:
Enron buys from Coral 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 2/15-2/16 at $420.00

I do not see this deal in Enpower.  


When I checked out with Amerex on the 14th all deals were confirmed.  When I 
cleared their deals all deals were cleared.
It is our policy to go back and check their web site for additions, changes 
etc. once every week for the week before and this deal popped up.

Can you please check to see if the schedulers received any confirmation of 
flow for this deal from Coral?

Thanks!!

One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as 
Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should 
it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde 
and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15.

There are two deals that do not have contact names.  Can you check with the 
trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact 
name or it cannot be prepared.

Audrey,

Concerning deal #579038:  This was a mistake on my part, the price should in 
fact be $80 (as the APX is showing).  I've fixed the price in Enpower.

Concerning deal #581335:  This trade did take place between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Industries (not the APX).  I mistakenly put that deal in under the 
wrong counterparty.  I've fixed the counterparty in Enpower.

I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals.  Let me know if I need to 
do anything further.

Thanks,

Kate & Stan,
Deal #579038.1
Enron is showing $85 for the offpeak load on 4/13 & 4/14..... APX is showing 
$80 for offpeak on 4/13 & 4/14....please verify and correct if necessary.  I 
have also attached APX invoice per the internet website below for both days.

Deal 581335.1
APX is currently not showing that this deal occurred for 4/16 for offpeak 
load (see screen  below at the bottom).  Please verify if this is some other 
c/p's deal.  Thanks.

Good morning Ladies!
This deal has two different terms entered.  One says 12/1/00-12/31/00 (in 
which case, it needs to be changed to "yes/agreement" and the other says 
12/1/00-12/1/00 (in which case, we don't confirm).
Please let me know.
Thanks!  Glad to have you with us Kate!!!

Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

Thanks,
Kate

hi kate,
these sean crandall deals need contacts.  can you please get a good contact

Hello, I noticed that deal # 253768 is an index deal with EES that has not 
been changed from the CAL PX to the Dow Jones index.  Could you ask Valerie 
or Bob Badeer if this deal should be changed?  I was going to send them a 
revised confirm.

Thanks!

I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
as they are.

Thanks,
Kate

That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
double check with Bob for accuracy.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.

Hello, I think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy 
resale instead of as transmission.  There are not any other transmission 
deals in the system with this counterparty.  If you would not mind looking 
into this and letting me know I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

Hello, I noticed that deal # 253768 is an index deal with EES that has not 
been changed from the CAL PX to the Dow Jones index.  Could you ask Valerie 
or Bob Badeer if this deal should be changed?  I was going to send them a 
revised confirm.

Thanks!
Melissa

Mark's got the price in for deal #484076 as $325. He's gone now, but I 
checked with Tom Alonso, who also trades on the Short Term Southwest desk, 
and he said it's definitely 325. Let me know if the broker still disputes 
this. As for 484077, it's in the system as $350 - is that correct?

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, 
I called earlier to check out with Prebon, of course all the West guys were 
gone to checkout, I spoke to a broker on the NY desk.
Please check the price of deal 
484076.01 (Mark Fischer)   $325.00  (broker thought price looked like 330.00)
484077.01                                $350.00

Thanks 
Stephanie

Can you have Matt Call Prebon on this deal?  It has been a very hectic 
morning!!

Please let me know the outcome.

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from..

deal 517877 is a SELL for Q2 at COB AT $313............THIS DEAL HAS BEEN 
CLEARED.
deal 517876 is a BUY for Q2 at MID-C AT 300.


Here is the amerex checkout for Mike Swerzbin with the deals he traded on 
2/8/01.

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Let me know if there are further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

Kate

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

This deal is in "Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty" status.  Some 
changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point 
with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or 
the energy type that is wrong?
Thanks for your help!

Whatever you changed on this deal, it now reads that it flows 32 hours a 
day!  You have five strips in, each flowing for 16 hours.

Also, when you change a deal, if you could make small note about what you 
changed in the comment section of deal entry, if really makes things go 
faster.  We know what change to look for when we make the revision.

Let me know when it is fixed.

Thanks!

aware of the change coming in April-02, but weren't aware they needed to 
enter comments in the deal. I'm sending an e-mail out to all of them to

special language.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Kate, that would be me. I need to see if the New Counterparty is the State of 
California Dept. of Water Resources or if the counterparty name in Enpower is 
correct: California Dept. of Water Resources. If it is the second one then we 
can choose the CP in Enpower. If it is the first one then we need to set them 
up in Global. This is Kerri Thompsons broker. I am also copying her so she is 
kept in the loop. Please let me know.

Thanks,

You're on the job girl!  I just got your email.  Don't worry about all the 
errors, if they didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't have a job, and it's no 
worse now than it's ever been.  But you are very responsive and fun to work 
with -that makes all the difference!  Just a little positivity (can't have

I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I 
noticed that the one you asked about, #481620, was part of an EES sleeve, so 
I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the 
incorrect energy type. It's holiday fever!

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

have Mike talk to his Amerex broker tomorrow morning and clear this up. He 
just might get a sweet deal out of it!

Mike did a deal with these terms but a price of 380 - deal is #571917. But he 
said a price like $292.50 doesn't sound right for Sept. - possibly May?

Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and 
has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm 
letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is 
referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

2. Also,  We have a length at PGE system  PGE Buy at system

As you know, we do not have a contract with Transalta Energy Marketing Corp. 
but with Transalta Energy Marketing (US) Inc.  I am changing this deal to 
that CP.  

Let me know if you have any objections or if you prefer to make the change 
yourself.  Do you want me to continue to let you know of these changes?  I 
know Carla preferred to make the changes herself.

Hello!

These deal have NP/SP delivery points with firm energy.
576522
576512
576523
576517
576513
and 576511, but this one is also the wrong CP name.  Reliant HLP doesn't 
trade in the west.  I think it should be Reliant Energy Services.

Thanks!

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.

Thanks!

Subject: Re: Hinson Power Company, Inc.  

Apparently, these are deals we entered in an attempt to cancel an existing 
contract with Hinson - so they are not actual purchases of power, which I 
believe is where the confusion over the confirm letters began. Christian is 
working on the legal aspect of how best to confirm these "deals," but as is 
so often the case with these guys (and especially around the holidays), they 
slipped out of the office before giving me an answer. So we'll get this done 
tomorrow morning. I'm sorry for the delay!

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!

for deal # 404980 (the original deal).  Please double check the deal entry in 
the new deals you've created (#512726.1 and #512743.1) to substitute the 
original one, and let us know how things are going asap so we can correct our 
distorted P&L report.

Thanks,
Fran

yes- so this is what prebon is saying on this deal 549052:
Enron buys from Pacificorp 25 mw of peak BOM Mid-C at $141.00

Thanks!!

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!
Kim

If you would put a note in the comment section in deal entry, that would be 
great.

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no 
confirm"? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Thanks!

Can you check and make sure this is the correct counterparty on this deal?  
We did a deal in February (#533916) with a little different name.  Also we

564894 - changed to Bloomberg - but it's a buy, not a sale - is this the same 
deal prebon is missing?

Hello, we have a fully executed termination letter for deal # 508797.01.  
Holli Krebs is aware that this BPA deal was going to be terminated.  Are you 
all going to kill this deal?

Thanks,
Melissa

Kate:

The deal 412868.1 was changed per Stewart Rosman and Jeff Richter requests.  

The deal 412868.1 was entered wrong for Sundays as:
0100-0600  MTWTFSa 15MW 
2200-2300 MTWTFSa 15MW
0100-2400 Sun, H  15MW
0700-2200 MTWTFSa 20MW

where it should be: 
7*16 and 7*8

Therefore, I zeroed out all volumes in 412868.1 and basically created a new 
leg (412868.2) to make the deal as what it should be.  

However, since today is 3/8 and the power for 3/4 (last Sunday) has already 
flowed/liquidated according to the wrong deal entry (412868.1 for 15MW, where 
it should be 20MW) and the trader told me the counterparty will make up the 
5MW this coming Sunday (3/11); therefore, I entered two new legs to account 
for these adjustments we need to make:

412868.3 LT-CALI sells 5MW  for 3/4
412868.3 LT-CALI buys 5MW for 3/11

We will need to confirm with the traders if we need to re-confirm these new 
deals/legs created.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Fran - It looks like you either made changes or added legs to this deal 
today. Do they need to reconfirm this? Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Can you find out if we are supposed to confirm the legs of this City of 
Roseville deal that were input today.  And what it is exactly that they are 
doing with these legs.

Thanks!
