San Francisco Muni Attempt Poses Additional Challenge for PG&E

Backers of a plan to create a publicly owned power system in San Francisco
and Brisbane, Calif., got a financial boost recently with a panel approving
$754,250 in taxpayer money to study public power and related issues. Most
of the money will be used to study how the proposed municipality district
would work and how it would be financed. The Board of Supervisors Finance
Committee approved the spending, but put $400,000 of the money on reserve,
pending the selection of contractors to perform the study and determine
the scope of the work.

ANALYSIS: This news item circulated about two weeks ago, but it still deser=
ves
attention as this could have tremendous impact on PG&E. The announcement
of the municipalization study comes at arguably the worst possible time
for PG&E as the utility already faces a multitude of financial and public
relations problems. Yet, in fact, the issue has been developing for several
months. Back in July, supporters of municipalization in PG&E's service
territory turned in a petition with 23,500 signatures calling for the creat=
ion
of a municipal utility district (meaning that electric service would be
provided by a city rather than an investor-owned utility).

First, let me provide some brief context regarding PG&E's current condition=
.
The utility is in debt of over $3 billion due to uncollected fees related
to the price spikes of last summer. PG&E's objective is to bill its custome=
rs
for this debt, and toward that end has petitioned to raise its rates with
the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  Under PG&E's plan,
average residential monthly bills reportedly would increase from about
$54.50 to $63.50 on Jan. 1. Naturally, consumer activist groups such as
TURN that carefully monitor PG&E's every move have contested the rate=20
increase,
arguing that the utility alone is responsible for the debt it currently
faces. Since it is uncertain if the CPUC will grant PG&E's petition,=20
speculation
that the utility will become financially insolvent has begun to grow.

Both San Francisco and the smaller city of Brisbane to the south are includ=
ed
in the study because municipalization must include two separate cities
in order to take effect. If municipalization is ultimately approved, these
two cities would form a new district and elect directors who would then
attempt to purchase PG&E's power grid in the area.

Proponents of the muni bypass effort say that the cities can provide less
expensive power to customers than PG&E, as the utility must pay dividends
to stockholders and compensate well-paid executives. PG&E has already start=
ed
damage control in response to the study, arguing against the formation
of a municipal utilities district. First, the utility has said simply that
it is not for sale, but more importantly it is PG&E's contention that=20
customers
would not necessarily save money if the cities in question were to=20
municipalize
their electric districts. In addition, PG&E says the cost for the cities
to buy its assets=01*necessary power plants, utility lines and other=20
infrastructure=01*would
run about $1 billion, which in fact would make the project more expensive
in the long run for customers.

Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield is spearheading the municipalization
effort and is using the problems in San Diego as a means to support his
case. His name may sound familiar, as Rosenfield has been involved in many
seemingly anti-investor owned utility (IOU) measures in California. Back
in 1998, Rosenfield led the fight for Proposition 9, which would have=20
essentially
put a screeching halt on deregulation in the state. Although Prop. 9 was
ultimately defeated at the ballot, had it passed the measure would have
stopped the three California IOUs from charging customers for the costs
associated with $6 billion in bonds they had sold to pay for the 10-percent
rate cut that customers began receiving in January 1998. Prop. 9 would
have blocked the utilities from recouping any of their stranded costs,
which of course SDG&E has now accomplished and reportedly the other IOUs
(SCE and PG&E) are close to doing so as well. Rosenfield was a key particip=
ant
in Californians Against Utility Taxes (CUT), which lobbied repeatedly for
electric rates to be reduced by 20 percent for small consumers (as opposed
to the 10 percent that was included in the state's restructuring bill).

Along with this study related to specific cities, there reportedly is a
simultaneous movement from Governor Gray Davis for a state takeover of
the power transmission grid, power plants and government-sponsored=20
construction
of new generating plants. In early December, an internal memo was leaked
indicating that the governor was considering these measures as a response
to the tight supplies and high prices seen in San Diego last summer. Includ=
ed
in the plan would be a restructuring of the state's power system wherein
the grid of transmission lines and power plants would be placed under state
control. Among several points on which PG&E and the governor disagree,
Davis has proposed an extended rate freeze for customers of all of the
three state's IOUs. While PG&E is pushing for a rate increase, California's
highest official reportedly would implement an indefinite rate freeze that
would further complicate PG&E's plan to pull itself out of debt.

Municipalization attempts in cities across the United States have increased
over the last two decades. Just last week, the city of Hermiston, Ore.,
was granted the right to acquire, by condemnation, the distribution facilit=
ies
that Pacific Power uses to serve parts of the municipality. The Umatilla
County Circuit Court has upheld the city of Hermiston's right to acquire,
by condemnation, the distribution facilities Pacific Power uses to serve
parts of the municipality. The city has been trying to acquire those=20
facilities
since 1998, with the intent of forming its own utility to serve the 4,000
commercial and residential customers now served by Pacific Power. Of course=
,
even though this is a significant ruling, it will remain embroiled in court
for some time. A jury trial to set the dollar amount of compensation for
Pacific Power's facilities won't start until March 12, 2001. Other=20
well-publicized
municipalization attempts have taken place in Lakewood, N.Y. (failed) and
a number of cities across Florida.

However, despite the rise in muni bypass efforts, the fact remains that
no contested municipalization effort of any significant size has been=20
successful
since the one that occurred in Massena, N.Y. back in 1982. At that time,
the city of Massena offered low-cost hydropower and tax-free financing,
which made the municipalization attempt beneficial to citizens. Today,
cities rarely can offer such advantages, which had made it difficult for
muni bypass efforts to succeed. Statistics show that, when given the option
to develop a city-run electric system by dissolving the incumbent utility's
authority, citizens across the country have chosen to retain the IOU model.
Of course, arguments could be made that in such cases the IOU lobbying
force has been a formidable component, wielding the capital necessary to
wage a successful campaign to protect its business. Yet, at the same time,
a case can be made that the benefits of municipalization just have not
been proven and that explains why citizens generally have opted to retain
the IOU model.

There is both good and bad news for PG&E related to this particular study.
The bad news is that studies such as these most often recommend=20
municipalization,
which makes it very difficult for local politicians to resist a takeover.
In other words, because the wheels have started turning toward=20
municipalization
in the area, it is more than likely that PG&E will have to engage in a
battle to preserve its business. Even though past history shows the attempt
probably would not be successful if PG&E contests it, the bypass effort
would result in PG&E spending a lot of money and time to fight the effort.

The good news is that time is on the utility's side. Municipalization is
usually a long and involved process. The fact that the Finance Committee
gave the green light to proceed with the study is only the first in many
regulatory checkpoints. The next steps are the full board's consideration
of the funding request for the study, and subsequently a decision whether
or not to put municipalization on the local ballot. Then the hard campaigni=
ng
would begin to sway public opinion one way or the other. Thus, even if
muncipalization of the two cities were to occur, PG&E still has some time
to potentially resolve its debt situation and construct a strong opposition
to the muni attempt.

However, from a public relations standpoint, this is just the last thing
that PG&E needs at this point. The utility continues to spin media coverage
to convey that it is only trying to recoup a debt that it accrued on behalf
of its obligation to serve customers. Adversaries such as TURN and Harvey
Rosenfield, however, are just as aggressively working to convince the publi=
c
that PG&E is trying to unfairly stick customers with a $3 billion tab.
To now have discussions emerge about whether or not city government could
more effectively provide electric service is another fire that PG&E will
have to extinguish if it wants to remain operational.

Europe May Need 69,000 MW by 2005; What Generation Mix Will the Continent
Use to Reach that Goal?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five
years may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity
to be built, according to a new report from Financial Times Energy. The
additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through 2004,
but also includes Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
At the same time, concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being
exacerbated by Germany's plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power.

ANALYSIS: If FT Energy's projections for necessary generation additions
in Europe are accurate, I think there are some real challenges that the
Continent will face in reaching this goal. First off, for perspective,
let's be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming
Europe will need by 2005. The figure of 69,000 MW is roughly equivalent
to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system
in Texas. When we consider also that the United States consumes about double
the amount of power that Europe consumes, the projection that Europe will
need an additional 69,000 MW of new generating capacity is a staggering
proposition.

Granted, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption
has grown over the last two years. According to data included in its report,
FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from 2,409 
terrawatt-hours
(TWh) in 1998 to 2,446 TWh in 1999, an increase of about 1.5 percent per
year. While this may seem like a minimal increase, it is important to note
that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average. For instance,
estimated new capacity additions through 2005 are mainly concentrated in
Spain, France, Germany and Sweden. The growth in demand, coupled with market
liberalization, has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction
or purchase of generation assets.

Although reportedly 60 percent of the electricity market across Europe
has been liberalized to date, the Continent remains rather disjointed as
it is composed of 16 national markets that are all approaching privatization
at different speeds. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their
privatization movements in the early 1990s. Spain required its state-owned
utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February 1999, a process
that will continue through 2007. Germany decided to open 100 percent of
its market all at once in April 1998. And France resisted efforts to 
privatize,
and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European
Union. Consequently, although Europe may in fact need the 69,000 MW of
new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected, the type and extent
to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on
the energy policy of each independent nation. A variety of restrictions
may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount
of capacity.

Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization
and, by extension, its approach to generation development. I can't examine
the policy of each country in this forum, but I think a look at Germany
is warranted, both because it is a major component of Europe's total energy
market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact
the Continent as a whole.

Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation,
due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened
to competition. It follows that generation coming from Germany should 
contribute
a large percentage of the Continent's future power needs. However, a large
percentage of Germany's power has come from nuclear power, but that has
all changed over the last year. After the Social Democratic Party formed
a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party, nuclear energy became an
unacceptable energy source. The German government has essentially put a
moratorium on nuclear power, and in fact decided to eventually shut down
19 nuclear power plants in the country. Just last month, Germany's two
largest power producers, RWE AG and E.ON AG, announced plans to cut output
from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has
developed since Germany liberalized its market. The measures amount to
a reduction of about 10 percent in Germany's overall power generating 
capacity.


Moreover, nuclear energy has generated over one-third of Germany's nearly
500 billion kilowatt-hours of annual electricity demand, and one-third
of Western Europe's total electricity supply. As the future of nuclear
power in Germany looks rather dim, big questions surround what will replace
nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europe's
energy industry.

Coal currently produces about 50 percent of the power generation in Germany,
but as a result of the country's attempts to lower emissions, coal also
appears to be on a decline. Also, in Germany, as in the rest of Europe,
coal-industry subsidies will come to an end as early as 2005, making it
less economical to invest in coal-fired plants. At the same time, other
countries like France are exploring clean-coal technologies, but it is
questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand
across the Continent.

Generally, natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will
take the place of nuclear power in Europe, given the seemingly abundant
supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea. However, as demand
across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases, this may
impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe. In addition, there
are no effective rules across Europe for third-party access to private
pipeline grids, also putting into question the future of natural-gas supplies.
Also, as we have seen in the United States, as demand for natural gas 
increases,
so will the prices, which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary
power source.

As a result, much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable
energy. In fact, the German government wants to double renewable energy
output to 10 percent of total energy demand by 2010, using such forms as
hydroelectric and wind power. This seems consistent with what the rest
of Europe is doing. The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate
10 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2010. Scandinavian
countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and 
low-emission
forms of energy, with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of
the Nordic region's total electricity production.

Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western
Europe, with projects in Germany, Denmark and Spain ranking among the 
fastest-growing
in the world. Again, according to the U.S. DOE, wind power is projected
to grow by 1.9 percent per year in Western Europe. This growth prospective
is pretty dismal, and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will
be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe. Renewable energy works fine
when planning overall energy needs, but it rarely can be relied on to meet
peak demand. The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to
and the sun shines when it wants to, which can make peak planning based
on renewable energy difficult if not impossible. This being the case, many
critics say Europe's current move toward renewable energy is completely
unrealistic, arguing that it would take nearly 2,000 wind turbines to equal
one nuclear plant. In addition, the growth for renewable energy is plotted
over the course of ten to fifteen years. FT Energy marks the year 2005
as the point at which Europe will need the additional 69,000 MW of generating
capacity.

In addition, despite the fact that coal-fired generation poses pollution
problems, it is still a comparatively low-cost form of generation. This
will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence
of a strong worldwide commitment. The U.S. Department of Energy projects
only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of
energy through 2020, just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain
a slim 8-percent share of the total world energy consumption.

So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for
new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources
that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs? First, keep in
mind that I've focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role
in Europe as a whole. However, the restrictions on nuclear power are not
necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries. For
instance, the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by
opening a plant in Temelin. The question is, without Germany's contribution
of nuclear power, will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other
power sources and other countries? Although the 69,000 MW goal seems very
ambitious, Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use
of merchant plants. As competition continues, wholesale power buyers are
demanding shorter-term contracts, which in turn is supporting a growing
trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent. Presently, only
the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power, but there
are signs that the trend is extending to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
and even Germany. In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear
power, merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europe's
natural-gas market. Yet, as we have seen in California, the plant siting
process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles, and it is not clear
if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries.
Plus, the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily 
natural-gas
fired, which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source.

Moreover, just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter
due to our own brand of energy supply problems, we are finding that the
problem is not limited to our part of the world. It is, of course, unknown
if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of 69,000 MW by 2005.
Yet, at the same time, it is clear that demand on the Continent continues
to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline.

UL Approval for MTL 7000 Series Barriers


Many of you have inquired whether MTL barriers and isolators held UL
approval, and we are most pleased to report that Underwriters Laboratories
has granted UL 913 (Intrinsically Safe Applications) approval to all MTL
7000 Series Shunt Diode Barriers -- this adds to our FM and CSA approvals.

The 7000 series has been categorized by UL as "Process Control Equipment for
Use in Hazardous Locations." The barriers are suitable for use in Class
I/Division 2, Groups A/B/C/D hazardous locations with intrinsically-safe
connections to Class I/II/III, Groups A/B/C/D/E/F/G hazardous locations.

MTL barriers are used more often than those of any other manufacturer of
Intrinsically Safe Devices, and you may already be aware that Control
magazine has once again cited MTL for its Readers' Choice Award - this
continues the succession of recognition in 1997, 1998, and 1999.

The MTL 7000 Series Barriers offer exceptionally high packing density (.28
in.), about half the size of conventional barriers -- this nearly doubles
normal packing density, reduces weight, and delivers a significant savings
on cabinet space.

Another advantage is the integral disconnet facility for isolating safe and
hazardous area circuits. The line can be disconnected without disturbing the
wiring just by swinging out the replaceable fuse. This allows significant
potential cost savings by enabling the MTL 7000s to function as a field
terminal in many instances.

Finally, the MTL 7000 Series improves flexibility and reduces installed
cost, since the barriers are clamped and grounded simultaneously on a
standard DIN-rail.

To discover how you can benefit from an MTL solution in a variety of
applications, visit us at www.mtlnh.com, www.mtl-inst.com, and/or
www.telematic.com. You may call MTL at (800) 835-7075 for the location of
the MTL Representative nearest to you.

With the completion of the Enron SAP implementation known as "Apollo & 
Beyond" in August 2000, a new organization, the Integrated Solutions Center 
(ISC), was formed. The ISC is a support organization for Enron-wide back 
office information systems which, of course, includes SAP users and the SAP 
system.

The web is an integral form of support for our customers and as you may know, 
the ISC recently launched a new website in order to better serve its 
customers and to reflect the widening scope of services the ISC has to 
offer.  

>From Friday 1st December 2000 sap.enron.com will route to isc.enron.com in 
preparation for the final closure of the "old" website on Tuesday 5th 
December 2000.  

All due diligence was taken when verifying and validating documents that were 
migrated from the old to the new site.  In order to assist you in navigating 
around isc.enron.com, please note the following navigation tips:

- Online forms reside at isc.enron.com > Online Forms

- Non-online forms (formerly at sap.enron.com > Quick Ref Tools) reside in 
the Document Library at  isc.enron.com > Online Forms > Other forms

- Documentation (ie User Procedures, quick ref cards, step-by-steps) reside 
in the Document Library at isc.enron.com under Get Help > Document Library

Please take a moment today to visit http://isc.enron.com and familiarize 
yourself with the new site if you haven't already been able to do so.

Judy Weakly and I delivered 89 stuffed Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes to 
the Omaha distribution point yesterday .  It was quite a sight to see 
thousands of gaily wrapped shoeboxes against the back wall.   Northern Border 
paid the shipping costs - thank you Northern Border!   From here the boxes 
will go to Minneapolis, and from Minneapolis they will be shipped around the 
world.  Volunteers, like you and me, will place them in the hands of precious 
children in pretty tragic circumstances, giving them a bright spot they will 
probably never forget .

Thank you so much, everyone, for your selflessness.  You just HAVE to be the 
greatest!!  J

Subject: Re: TW Fuel  

 First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who 
were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done 
today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal 
Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from 
Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a 
(slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream 
sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have 
come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done 
in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the 
sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies 
that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps 
get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control 
should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented 
if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we 
actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure 
management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are 
appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, 
Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF

Subject: TW Fuel

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF

*********************************************************

Warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the foc=
us=20
in the
gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growi=
ng=20
sense
that supplies might just prove adequate. The result has been a steady and=
=20
steep
decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into
the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t=
he=20
mid-
$5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua=
l=20
fuel oil
in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20
inventories
will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade=
quate
supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to=
 a=20
quick
return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap.

Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe=
r=20
20
accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif=
t=20
in
market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima=
tely=20
3.8
Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and =
58=20
Bcf
above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob=
er=20
22.
With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20
expected
next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o=
n
October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table=
=20
1).

Is this inventory level "enough"? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter=
=20
under 15-
year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf=
=20
above
the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20
withdrawals in
the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo=
ve=20
last year=01,s
withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac=
e=20
of a
return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul=
d
bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and
growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20
winter,
holding withdrawals down requires both of the following:

* Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol
producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices
must remain shut down. These markets represent
approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return,
should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol.

* The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning
residual fuel oil must remain off of gas.

In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,=
=20
particularly
as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20
demand can
be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c=
an=20
be held
reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar=
ch=20
1996
and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag=
e=20
of
$3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was=
=20
nearly
4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa=
s=20
lower,
and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20
customers in
the United States.

Market fundamentals in CERA=01,s view still support gas prices above those =
of=20
resid,
which as of this writing is pricing in the $4.75-$5.00 per MMBtu range. War=
m
weather throughout November and into December could reverse this=20
relationship, but
a warm October alone is insufficient, and any cold weather within the next =
few
weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the=20
market.
CERA=01,s price outlook for November--an average of $5.50 at the Henry Hub-=
-
stands for now.

Endesa Receives Green Light to Move into France
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Endesa (NYSE: ELE), Spain's largest power utility, has signed an agreement
with Charbonnages de France (CDF) to acquire a 30-percent interest in the
French electricity generator Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Thermiqu=
e
(SNET). The transaction has been authorized by the French Government. The
agreement includes Endesa's right to increase its interest in SNET in the
medium term in order to strengthen the cooperation between both companies
and allow Endesa to carry out its industrial development plan in France
and Europe.

ANALYSIS: The approval for Endesa to acquire 30-percent interest in SNET
cements the company's move into France, which is a major component in the
aggressive expansion efforts Endesa has been implementing this year. SNET,
while a comparatively small company by American standards, is still the
second largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity=
,
and third largest in terms of electricity generation. SNET owns five coal
plants totaling 2,600 megawatts, which generate about 6,838 GWh annually.
This is a very low output, and in fact SNET accounts for only 2.5 percent
of the market share in France. However, given the fact that France's larges=
t
energy company, EDF, still has a hold on about 90 percent of the market
in the country, any acquisition of the next-largest company is a major
coup. The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of
the company's experience in coal-based electricity=01*which still is the po=
wer
source for roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent=01=
*and
its progressiveness in terms of technology.

Presently, SNET sells the bulk of its electricity output to EDF under a
long-term contract between the two companies. The rest of its generation
is sold to eligible customers. In addition to its current assets, SNET
is also planning a new 350-MW gas-fired station in eastern France and is
the front runner to build a new clean-coal plant in the heavily industriali=
zed
Rhone Valley. Thus, as France slowly opens its market to competition, SNET
could emerge as one of the major providers. Endesa was able to beat out
other bidders for SNET, including France's Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and
Germany's RWE, due to the positive valuation of Endesa's industrial and
commercial projects and the economic value of its offer.

Endesa already entered the French market last month with a three-year=20
exclusive
agreement to serve the energy needs of SEB, a small appliance company.
The company's move outside of Spain resulted from several factors. First,
the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the domestic growth of
its largest electric companies, essentially land-locking the domestic growt=
h
of companies like Endesa and forcing them to look outward for growth=20
opportunities.
In addition, growth in countries like France and Germany is probably appeal=
ing
to Endesa because their central location offers additional expansion=20
opportunities
into Italy and Eastern Europe. Just within the last year, privatization
has come to the major European countries=01*either all at once, as in the
case of Germany, or in forced increments, as occurred in France. There
has been little question that Endesa would like to develop generation=20
interests
across the Continent, and has taken advantage of competitive opportunities
as they have emerged. In fact, Endesa disclosed that it plans to become
a leading European power player through the swap of assets with other=20
electricity
customers and through acquisitions. Rumor has it that Endesa is also lookin=
g
to acquire the generation assets of Enel=01*Italy's state-owned power and
the biggest European rival to EDF.

However, as Endesa expands abroad it continues to face significant problems
in Spain, due mostly to its proposed merger with the second largest=20
electricity
provider in the country, Iberdrola. Just last month, Endesa announced that
it had entered into a "friendly merger" with Iberdrola. Together, the two
companies will gain a hold over 80 percent of Spain's power market with
a combined market capitalization of the equivalent to $32 billion. Reported=
ly,
the merger will create the world's third-biggest electricity company, after
Tokyo Electric Power and Enron. However, Spanish oil company Repsol, which
lost out on the bid for Iberdrola to Endesa, continues to contemplate renew=
ing
a hostile takeover of the company. Repsol claims that it in fact offered
1.2 more euros per share than what Endesa has promised to pay for Iberdrola
in their $13 billion merger, but that Iberdrola did not even consider the
bid. Both Endesa and Repsol are partially owned by the Spanish government
(only 33 percent of Endesa is publicly traded), so presently negotiations
are being held to see if a compromise can be reached. Reportedly, the merge=
r
between Endesa and Iberdrola can occur only if some of the companies belong=
ing
to the merged company are sold, as per the Spanish antimonopoly legislation=
.
Ironically, this could benefit Repsol as the company plans to invest in
any companies that are divested due to the merger.

France has been criticized by other European nations for delaying energy
liberalization across the Continent. In fact, France has only opened its
power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the European Union.
While other European countries have opened 100 percent of their markets
to competition, France has opted for a phased-in approach, opening a third
each of its power and gas markets by February 2003 and August 2008,=20
respectively.
Thus, although Endesa is certainly pushing through barriers to obtain entry
into France, it is questionable when true competition will emerge in the
country. A report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency, issued
just last week, contends that France's power liberalization law restricts
power trading and allows EDF to keep its market advantages.

However, even though Endesa may face expansion limitations in France, it
is important to remember how large the company is in its home country.
Endesa produces about half of Spain's electricity (22,500 MW), relying
mainly on nuclear and coal-fired plants. Looking to diversify, Endesa also
owns interests in gas, water, and telecommunications companies. It is the
largest shareholder in Auna, a jointly owned company (with partners Telecom
Italia and Uni?n Fenosa) that controls Retevisi?n, Spain's second-largest
phone company, behind Telef?nica. In addition, Endesa is also investing
heavily in energy firms in Latin America. Thus, although France is very
important for Endesa's European expansion efforts, the company is still
a contender in other key markets.

A prehearing conference was held last Friday in Phase II of Wisconsin Gas 
Company's proposal to build a 35-mile lateral to connect to the new Guardian 
pipeline.  The schedule and issues list adopted is detailed below.  It 
assumes issuance by mid-January of the final FERC EIS on the project.  

I would appreciate as soon as possible your feedback on whether or not 
Northern has any issues that should be addressed through the filing of 
testimony in this phase.  

Schedule

Jan. 25  --  Possible scheduling conference if FERC EIS has been delayed.  
10:30 a.m.

Feb. 20 -- Prefiled direct testimony due "in-hand" to all parties by noon.

Mar. 8   -- Prefiled rebuttal testimony due in-hand to all parties by noon.

Mar. 13 -- Prefiled surrebuttal testimony due in-hand to all parties by noon.

Mar. 19 -- Full week set aside for landowner hearings in the field - likely 
locations are Germantown and Oconomowoc.

Mar. 26 --Full week set aside for technical hearings in Madison.

Issues List

The formal issues list for Phase II will be included in the ALJ's prehearing 
order.  Subject to refinement of final wording it will look something like 
this:

---Physical aspects to the lateral and possible effects on landowners & the 
environment.

---FERC EIS & applicable WI statutes, including the Wisconsin Environmental 
Protection Act (WEPA).

---Engineering and safety

---Alternate routes

---Environmental implications including economic value and economic impact

---Landowner and land use implications/ Farmland productivity & economic 
effects on particular landowners.

Please Note:

We have changed the correlation of the Transwestern's hedges to the same 
index(El Paso Permian) that the derivatives were transacted.  We feel it is 
appropriate to make this correlation change due to management's anticipation 
to make the 2001 sales at an El Paso Permian index.  Due to this change TW 
has a perfect correlation, therefore the associated Value at Risk  will be 
zero.

Subject: Re: New Marketing Company  


Steve,

Yes, Dan did ask my opinion on the feasibility of forming a new affiliate 
company (NEWCO).  I know he asked many others as well.  Here is what I told 
him:

There is no regulatory prohibition on NEWCO holding capacity on our pipelines.
NEWCO will have to be set up to meet the creditworthiness standards or else 
we raise the risk of having to lower the creditworthiness test for others.
Under the current rules, even though NEWCO will hold capacity, NEWCO will not 
be a Marketing Affiliate (i.e. requiring separate staff/systems) etc. so long 
as they are not buying or selling gas.  On the flip side, if the new 
affiliate sells gas Including delivered gas), the entity will be a Marketing 
Affiliate and we would have to set if up so all the separation rules are 
met.  I anticipate that FERC's marketing affiliate rules may change in 2001 
such that any energy affiliate, including capacity managers, will be subject 
to the marketing affiliate standards of conduct.  If the success of NEWCO 
depends on sharing unposted information, this strategy is not likely to last 
very long.
Most significantly, when the new affiliate wants to resell/trade its capacity 
rights, it will have to do so through the pipeline's capacity release rules.  
The new affiliate can arrange pre-arranged transactions of less than 30 days, 
but any other deals would have to be posted for bid.   But, I don't think we 
should be scared off just because the deals would have to go through capacity 
release.  NEWCO could do less than 30 day releases at above max. rates on a 
prearranged basis.  NEWCO could also do 1 year of less prearranged deals at 
above max rate,  they would just have to be posted to see if anyone wanted to 
match the deal.


The crux is that there is no regulatory prohibition standing in the way of 
setting up a new affiliate, but it is important to figure out what the new 
affiliate's objective is.  
If the point is to capture short-term, above max rate deals without going 
through a negotiated rate posting, then we may follow a fairly simple 
strategy of setting up a limited NEWCO to buy and sell capacity only.  
If the point is to "churn" capacity trading, then the issues are essentially 
the same as those involved in setting up bid/ask trading on EOL.  
If the point is longer-term, total energy type of deals, then we just need to 
understand that the new affiliate will be a marketing affiliate.

You ask what is being done to further this idea.   I think we need some 
clearer marketing vision of how NEWCO plans to make money (through above max 
rate deals in capacity release?  through rebundled deal? ) before  a more 
definitive list of regulatory steps can be developed.

Shelley,
 I know Danny talked to you a while back about us creating a new company to 
hold capacity on other pipes, etc. What ever happened to that idea? I would 
really like to pursue that avenue as I believe we may be missing out on some 
things we could do. Please let me know the status. Thanks.

 Steve

Approximately 200 industry executives were in attendance at the first day
of the Energy Exchanges Online conference, held Monday through Wednesday
of this week in Scottsdale, Ariz. The conference was presented by London-ba=
sed
EyeforEnergy. In morning keynote presentations from Mark Crosno, executive
vice president of Altra Energy Technologies, and Keith Butler, COO,=20
DukeSolutions,
issues of how deregulation and the Internet have spawned a new species=01*t=
he
e-utility=01*were discussed. A key focus of the conference was the growing
focus on online exchanges and how the entire value chain for the wholesale
energy market is being impacted by new technologies.

ANALYSIS: I attended and also spoke on a panel discussion during the first
day of this conference. What I found particularly noteworthy about the
dialogue taking place was that, despite participation from diverse sectors
of the energy industry=01*utilities, regulators, consultants, ESPs, IT=20
infrastructure
providers, and others=01*several key points were reiterated throughout the
discussion.

First, there is little doubt left that e-commerce and new technologies
are changing the entire complexion of the energy industry. Resulting from
that dynamic, energy companies presently find themselves in a transformatio=
n
related to how they will and should conduct their businesses. While new
technologies certainly offer new opportunities for companies to expand
information and services that already exist in an electronic form, question=
s
still remain about how much the market itself will bear in terms of buildin=
g
new online exchanges for e-commerce.

As noted, the conference focused on online exchanges. Within my presentatio=
n,
I discussed that essentially four different kinds of exchanges have emerged
within the last 20 months: supply chain, commodity trading, transmission,
and retail exchanges. A supply chain exchange exists primarily to line
up buyers and sellers of parts related to the energy industry, with the
end goals of lower product prices and procurement processing costs, exposur=
e
to a worldwide audience, and shorter order and fulfillment cycles. A commod=
ity
trading exchange exists for companies engaged in bulk wholesale trading
to buy and sell energy packages. A new form of exchange is emerging with
transmission exchanges. We don't know a whole lot about them yet, but a
group of utilities in the Midwest recently proposed a transmission exchange
that would "be the electronic clearinghouse of information flow around
transmission assets and the market." How a transmission exchange would
correlate with an RTO=01*which also manages transmission flow=01*is not yet=
 clear.
Finally, the retail online providers could also be considered a form of
exchange in that they are operating exclusively across the Internet.

With that established, several key issues will rise to the forefront in
2001 as many exchanges finally come online and the new business segment
enters its second year. First and foremost, establishing neutrality seems
to be the primary challenge. Questions were raised at the conference about
trading exchanges established by a proprietary participant that is involved
in every buy or sell on that particular exchange. The general consensus
among those present at the conference was that, although concerns about
neutrality have not prevented exchanges such as EnronOnline from becoming
very successful, regulatory pressure from the FTC may eventually make=20
neutrality
a requirement. In addition, when given a choice over various exchanges
on which to participate, the sense that I got from the dialogue was that
traders would arguably prefer to participate on an exchange where issues
of disclosing competitive information are not a concern.

The second trend as we move forward is liquidity. With regard to commodity
exchanges, what participants want and what makes an exchange the most=20
successful
is liquidity (meaning, essentially, the amount of transactions on the excha=
nge
and, consequently, the opportunity to access beneficial deals). A point
that I made in my presentation is that the larger exchanges naturally seem
to have the most liquidity. Again, the example of EnronOnline, which=20
reportedly
has now logged over $200 billion in transactions, cannot be overlooked.
This raises the question of whether or not smaller exchanges will even
find opportunities to move into such a saturated market. As a result, a
related trend that I see is the consolidation of existing exchanges, along
with a blending of current business models into one exchange format. As
companies realize that it is already fairly late in the game to be building
an exchange, the smart move may be to join or merge with an already-existin=
g
format. I think we will also see multiple exchanges merging into one to
gain a lock on various market niches.

The third trend that should emerge over the next year is the separation
of commodities. Traders will want the flexibility of having separate platfo=
rms
for different commodities, including power, natural gas, bandwidth, etc.
Dynegydirect is already moving in that direction by offering separate tradi=
ng
floors that allow traders to group products in a customized way. I think
we will see more and more of this trend as traders demand this option.

The trends I mentioned here have focused mostly on commodity trading. That
is primarily due to the fact that we simply don't know enough about how
several prominent supply chain exchanges will operate. Enporion just last
week logged its first transactions (five reverse auctions in which UGI
was the buyer of natural gas). Pantellos still has another month or so
before it comes online. Of course, there are many smaller supply chain
exchanges like UtilityFrontier (municipal-oriented), RAPIDpartsmart and
Bex.com, but the general consensus at the conference was that all supply
chain exchanges will need to provide significant cost savings for=20

and that has yet to be universally demonstrated. Most observers of this
particular trend are reserving judgment until next year when real-time
results are disclosed.

Moreover, the evolving energy marketplace is providing many new opportuniti=
es
for energy companies to redefine themselves and develop new business models=
.
However, much of the water that energy companies may be venturing into
is uncharted territory. The risks and competition associated with building
an online exchange can be formidable, and may dissuade some energy companie=
s
from developing in that direction. The question is, as we move further
down the path of an e-based energy industry, can energy companies avoid
participation in some form of an exchange? As always, the answer will proba=
bly
be found along the bottom line, which for many of these exchanges should
emerge sometime over the next year.

John,
I am forwarding the Level B estimate for the Gallup modification. This 
involves increasing the horsepower output (from 12,000  to 15,000 HP drive)at 
the station
with a consequent flow increase of 10mmcfd.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
thanks

Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...

The problem:

As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the 
following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: "if the rate 
bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be 
the maximum tariff rate," and the additional frustrating language "[a]ll 
available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."  At our 
last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could 
capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate 
to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount 
of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any 
index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I 
have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of 
other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum 
rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  
However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical 
change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW 
lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.

Why the problem exists (you may already know):

Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in 
the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the 
Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for 
negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a 
cost-of-service based tariff rates.  "[T]he availability of a recourse 
service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that 
the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline 
unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
recourse rate mitigates market power."  

The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest 
rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its 
transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly 
not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper 
willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely 
because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  "When there are 
more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the 
pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either 
the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata 
basis if required by its tariff."  The example cited by the Commission:  If a 
pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one 
who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a 
negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata 
basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some 
other allocation method such as lottery).  

When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added 
the statement that "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the 
rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."  Presumably we had 
concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order 
to receive negotiated rate authority.  

Solutions??

I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language 
outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been 
chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I 
keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is 
where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  
Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the 
recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still 
have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic 
warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive 
proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.

Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more 
than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  
We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more 
than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, 
despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely 
we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be 
able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But 
I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that 
recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either 
of you seen anything to the contrary?  

I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to 
discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to 
discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few 
minutes.  Thanks.

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Subject: Risk System Alternatives Next Steps

Lee,
Just to recap the meeting with Richard Burchfield and Steve Stock, based on 
the requirements that you and Vernon have identified, we would need to use 
several of the system components including TAG, ERMS, GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, 
CREDIT, and UNIFY for settlements.  All of these applications are tightly 
integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would 
separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and 
would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity 
and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it 
would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as 
maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the 
marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate 
application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as 
support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is 
also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning 
on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all 
are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and 
would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.

Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but 
we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources 
from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and 
database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the 
process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be 
possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If 
we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of 
these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on 
sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these 
applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most 
timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from 
Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.

  Drew J. Fossum
  Counsel
  Enron Corp.

Dear  Mr. Fossum:

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to LRSolutions.  It is 
our mission to provide corporate in-house counsel with all the tools and 
resources necessary to excel in every area of legal practice - preventative 
law, new product development and new markets, litigation support, 
transactional work, and regulatory compliance, among others.  At LRSolutions, 
we are able to meet this challenge through the provision of expert legal 
knowledge at reasonable, fixed prices.

As you are well aware, legal research and related "knowledge" activities and 
products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise.  
(if you would like to see our website it is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  
Click on any of the links on the lefthand side of the screen for detailed 
descriptions).  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of 
"reinventing the wheel", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  
Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing 
inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to 
the enormous costs for corporate counsel.

However, LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and 
quality.  Our network of legal experts includes hundreds of the nation's 
premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized 
intuitively into areas of specialty.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/network.html.  In addition, our Board of Advisers 
includes the former Chief Counsel for Cigna Corporation, the former Associate 
General Counsel from Proctor and Gamble, and a partner from a large 
Washington D.C. law firm.

Experienced, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related 
projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  Our products 
and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research 
memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials 
such as appellate briefs and court filings, and listings of relevant 
authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and 
objective that best suits your needs.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/expert.html.

We also are in the early stages of developing essential online compliance 
education training for corporate employees.  As you know, compliance training 
is essential if corporations are to avoid damaging liability.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/online.html.  Federal sentencing guidelines and 
courts often reduce or eliminate liabiity for companies with effective 
programs.  We are looking for corporations that are interested in forming 
strategic alliances with LRSolutions regarding production of these courses.  
Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com/strategic.html.

I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting at your corporate 
headquarters to discuss LRSolutions further.  If you would like to contact me 
by phone, or would like to receive a brochure, please feel free to call at 
1-800-627-8047.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.  I am 
convinced that LRSolutions will be a critical and welcome long-term resource 
for your legal department and greatly look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely Yours

Ray Nussbaum, Esq.
CEO, President
LRSolutions, Inc.

I just got back after spending the day at jury duty.  I was one of 60 that 
had to go through voir dire.  They picked up to juror 43 but I do not think 
they would have gotten to me.  I am sure that I was struck by the defense 
counsel.  This was a criminal case and it appears that their would be some 
type of mental capacity test.  The defense attorney asked the 60 of us if the 
government should provide mental health services for those who could not pay 
for them.  This immediately rankled my Republican blood and I raised my 
hand.  I was the only one who did that.  Call me heartless but I am now in my 
office instead of hearing how the devil made him do it.

No word on the Supremes.  I think the longer they take the worse it looks for 
Gore.  If they knew that they were going to find for Gore they would have at 
least lifted the stay with some parameters on how to recount.  The longer it 
takes the less like The Goreinch will not be able to steal our Christmas.

We are freezing our butts off down here.  It is in the 30s and we may have 
some sleet or freezing rain tonight.  That is enough to shut down this city 
for a week.  Nothing what you are used to up there.  We enjoyed having you 
over the other night.  Mary and I were glad that you put us on the list for 
your traveling circus.  Tell Sandra to come on down.  It is really not that 
bad.  And the stock price is back in the high 70s.  We have money again!

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Dan

Thanks for your comments below. 

We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures.  It wasn't a big deal 
for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in 
the consolidated statements.  As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there 
are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a 
stand-alone basis.  Since most of these positions will be gone by year end, 
it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter.  
In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions 
in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and 
we wouldn't have had all these gross positions.  I don't feel quite as bad 
about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I 
otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders 
disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the 
noteholders reports were distributed.  

As always, Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on 
Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures before they are finalized.

Subject: Quarterly Noteholder Reports

I've reviewed the draft NN and TW quarterly reports to noteholders.  I 
haven't had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings, but I have 
three questions/concerns.  First, the discussions of "Price Risk Management 
Activities" seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial 
impact of the deals involved.  For example, we disclose the total notional 
amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal, the "fair value" of the 
trades, and a variety of  other details, even the total economic impact of 
the deal to us is pretty small (about a million dollars if I remember 
right).  The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence.  
Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing 
something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller 
number)?  Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the 
Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW 
and NN portions offset one another.  I know we need to disclose deals 
separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like 
notional value and "fair value" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accurately 
reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN 
were out doing huge commodity deals.  Third, I have never been that concerned 
about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the 
limited distribution.   However, if these disclosures will be Arthur 
Anderson's template for the Enron Corp. 10Q or the FERC Form 2s, I have a

Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time 
(400-500 MMBtu/d 
hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to 
commission the
Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through.  
Some predictors 
are saying the delay may get longer.

Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November

Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will 
have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, 
because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the 
enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile 
project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. 

"Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has 
been removed from the line," says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. "However, periodic 
reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the 
required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux 
Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago." A spokesman said the 
debris included "bits of foam" that came off equipment used to extract 
moisture following hydrostatic testing. 

The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some 
observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline 
has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is 
designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of 
natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of 
pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline 
also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow 
the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control 
room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a 
physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the 
operation together around the clock 365 days a year. "It's a tremendously 
complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
all have to work together." 

Regardless of the delay, however, Alliance already is flowing a large amount 
of gas into the Chicago market. "At this point in our commissioning 
activities, the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50% of capacity. We 
expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm 
delivery capacity of 37.5 million cubic meters (1.325 Bcf) per day prior to 
the end of November."

Anonymous Letters Put UtiliCorp in Hot Water

Investigations in several states are getting under way into alleged illegal 
profit-taking by UtiliCorp United in Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota 
and Iowa. An anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be a current 
employee for UtiliCorp was sent to state regulators alleging the company's 
Gas Supply Service Department (GSS) took part in improper actions in 
reselling natural gas to customers in these states. 

"Personnel are paid bonuses based on the value that can be extracted from 
managing the assets paid for by the Missouri Public Service (MPS) 
ratepayers," the letter said. The anonymous author said that value is 
extracted in numerous ways that are undetectable to staff audit efforts. One 
method included in the letter was for UtiliCorp employees to sell a first of 
the month "put" to suppliers, invoicing the put premium on a separate invoice 
that would never be included in audited documentation. If prices drop, the 
supplier puts first of the month gas to MPS. 

Another scheme alleged in the letter includes capacity releases. "Operations 
personnel extract one-to-two cents per release by doing buy-sells with MPS 
capacity, instead of doing a posted release," said the letter. "They look at 
the lowest credit amount possible to report, instead of maximizing the 
capacity release credit." The anonymous author speculated that these actions 
are taken to reach the unit's lofty profit goal of $10 million. "Due to the 
emphasis on earnings, GSS's top priority is earnings, not providing 
efficient, reliable, economic gas supplies," the author concluded. 

Jerry Cosley, a UtiliCorp United spokesperson said, "We can say without 
qualification, that in no way would we approve of any improper behavior or 
business practice, so we are conducting our own review." 

Missouri appears to be the first state out of the gate on the investigation 
trail as the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission has recommended 
an investigation be conducted into the allegations. An MPS representative 
said that UtiliCorp denied the allegations of impropriety, but supports the 
staff's request to open an investigation. 

Iowa's Consumer Advocate is investigating the UtiliCorp charges in that 
state, said Chuck Seel, a spokesman for the Iowa Utilities Board. Seel said 
the Iowa and Minnesota letters, and the Michigan and Missouri letters, 
appeared to be similar to one another. He added that an observer from the IUB 
and a representative of the Consumer Advocate will attend a meeting next week

Cosley said UtiliCorp intends to conduct its own internal review, and would 
stay in touch with all of the affected regulatory commissions and report its

Evergreen Solar, Inc. Issues Successful IPO; Do Alternative Fuels Increase
Stock Value?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Waltham, Mass.-based Evergreen Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: ESLR) issued an initial
public offering of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at the IPO price
of $14 per share. Evergreen Solar develops, manufactures and markets solar
power cells, panels and systems throughout the world. The IPO reportedly
will raise $42 million in gross proceeds to support further expansion and
development by Evergreen Solar.

ANALYSIS: Here's yet another case of a relatively unknown company going
public based on grand marketing ideas rather than a solid track record.
Yet, surprisingly, the IPO has opened strong. Last Thursday (11/2), Evergreen
Solar's stock closed 36 percent above its offering price, at $19.00. At
the close of the market on Friday, the stock price had dropped to $17 ?,
but still represented a strong showing while other IPOs last week (both
energy and non-energy) have crashed and burned (Excelergy, for example).


What makes the strong IPO even more startling is Evergreen Solar's 
less-than-stellar
financial history. Since its inception in 1994, Evergreen has incurred
significant net losses ($2.5 million in 1998, $2.9 million in 1999 and
$1.9 million for the first six months of 2000). As a result of ongoing
operating losses, Evergreen has a cumulative net loss of $12.3 million
as of June 30, 2000, and has stated clearly that it "expects to incur 
substantial
losses for the foreseeable future, and may never become profitable." In
1999, product sales only accounted for 8.2 percent of total revenue, with
the rest coming from research grants. Granted, Evergreen is still in start-up
mode with regard to a large-scale production of its business, but still
it seems very odd to see such a strong IPO from a company that is really
just getting started.

So, what gives? Doesn't it seem logical that a company should demonstrate
financial stability before it goes public? And that if it's not financially
stable, the stock price should go down and not up? I'll provide one theory,
but first let's establish exactly what Evergreen Solar is all about.

The company's sales since 1997 have been composed primarily of solar panels.
Evergreen plans to begin large-scale manufacturing of its solar power products
in a new manufacturing facility in early 2001, a growth strategy that the
IPO proceeds obviously would support. Evergreen's principal objective is
to become a leading producer of high-quality solar power products, primarily
for the on-grid market and the off-grid rural electrification market. What
makes the company unique, according to Evergreen, is its String Ribbon
technology, which reportedly avoids the slicing of solid block of silicon,
which is required for most solar-power technologies. Evergreen's String
Ribbon technology reportedly cuts the use of silicon in half, which reduces
manufacturing costs without impairing product reliability.

In December 1999, Evergreen Solar formed a five-year strategic distribution
and marketing contract with Kawasaki for the Japanese market. Essentially,
Evergreen has agreed to sell its solar power products in Japan exclusively
through Kawasaki. In fact, the partnership constitutes the bulk of Evergreen's
business. In the first six months of 2000, sales to Kawasaki accounted
for approximately 70 percent of Evergreen's product revenues. After the
IPO, Kawasaki will have an 8.4 percent stake in Evergreen.

The risks associated with Evergreen's business are formidable, and the
company admits that its stock price could fall substantially if quarterly
revenue continues to be disappointing. Beyond that, Evergreen's success
hinges on the potential growth of the solar power market, which is still
in question. Evergreen contends that distributed generation technologies
(point-of-use electric generation that either supplements or bypasses the
electric grid) will be one of the most promising areas for growth in the
global electric power market, and within DG technologies solar power has
experienced significant growth over the last 20 years. In addition, solar
power produces zero emissions, and may grow as a result of renewable energy
requirements in various states.

This may be true, but at the same time there are other competing DG 
technologies
such as fuel cells, microturbines and wind power, which may slow the grow
of solar power. Plus, there's little proof that Evergreen's String Ribbon
technology will produce significant cost-savings to make it a standout
technology. There are other risks as well, not the least of which is the
exclusive relationship with Kawasaki. If the relationship goes sour, this
could dramatically diminish Evergreen's potential revenues and market share.

So, with this market profile, the question of why Evergreen had such a
strong IPO still remains. I think the answer is that Evergreen's business
focus is exclusively placed on alternative power. At a time when e-commerce
stocks are under growing pressure to demonstrate financial success, stocks
based on new technologies in general and alternative fuels in particular
are being received particularly well by investors. There is arguably a
general perception within the financial community that distributed generation
technologies will gain an increasingly strong lock on the energy market
in the next two years. Commercial and industrial customers want various
options that can reduce their dependence on the grid. With regard to 
alternative
fuels and distributed generation technologies, investors may believe that
either utilities or large end-users will begin to develop these technologies
as deregulation continues.

Remember Active Power (Nasdaq: ACPW), whose shares soared on expectations
that flywheel energy storage devices will be a leading technology. On its
opening day in August, Active Power stock increased by 210 percent, from
the opening price of $17 to $51 1/8. Although Active Power's stock price
has bounced around since then, it still closed at $30 on Nov. 3, a very
respectable level and approximately 111 percent above its original price.
Another example is Capstone Turbine (Nasdaq: CPST), which is currently
trading at $45 3/8 after opening at $16 in June.

Along with alternative fuels, venture capitalists also appear to be responding
to technology startups that plan to provide software and related services
to energy companies. Then there is the growing market of exchanges, such
as Pantellos, Enporion, Enermetrix and the like, which could be the next
big round of successful IPOs.

The long-term question is how long such stocks can continue to open so
successfully, without having a strong financial performance to support
the opening. E-commerce stocks started opening strong about a year or two
ago, but began to take a downward decline this spring as investors demanded
to "see the money." Evergreen Solar and similar stocks may be following
a similar path, which makes time a critical factor. The bottom line is
that it is a real race for a company like Evergreen Solar to secure as
much funding as it can and grow its business while the financial climate
remains strong.

FERC contacted INGAA to ask that pipelines call Dan Larcamp in the event that 
they experience any curtailments, supply shortages or other critical 
operations situations this winter.  FERC wants to hear from the pipelines and 
have some time to react before they are asked to respond in a public forum 
(particularly Congress).

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Rob Marvin of Inside FERC called for Mary Kay today with a couple questions.  
I reviewed them with Mary Kay and reported back to him.  He wanted to know 
what "Settlement Amount" and "Net Settlement Payment Due" meant on the 
schedules.  I told him "Settlement Amount" was the Kansas ad valorem tax 
refund obligation due under the Settlement, and that the "Net Settlement 
Payment Due" was what was remaining due if the producer had already paid 
money to Northern.  He then asked how the "Settlement Amount" was calculated 
and I told him that was subject to settlement negotiation privilege and that 
the parties agreed not to disclose any calculations or formulas in the 
Settlement.  Jrt

MEMO FROM DICK AMABILE



With the many organizational changes that have taken place recently, we have 
decided to cancel the P&D Facilitator training that was scheduled for Monday, 
11/13/00.  It is not likely that such training will take place before next 
year and we will keep you up to date as those plans are finalized.

LADWP Continues to Shine Despite California's Dark Period
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California=20
Independent
System Operator (Cal-ISO) on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency
for the second consecutive day. The Cal-ISO is calling on all California
electricity customers to increase their energy-conservation efforts, and
urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after 8 p.m. Responsib=
le
for the reliability of California's electricity grid, the Cal-ISO declares
a Stage One emergency when the state's power reserves drop to 7 percent.
In contrast, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the
municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area,
announced that its more than 3.7 million businesses and residences are
enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into
the holiday season.

ANALYSIS: What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman, LADWP's genera=
l
manager. Just two years ago the municipal utility=01*the largest city-owned
utility in the United States=01*was ridden with massive debts and faced an
uncertain future. Now, LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success
story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another.


Let's take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself
from the California crisis. Back in 1997, Freeman was brought on board
at LADWP (from the Cal-ISO, no less) to essentially save what was thought
to be a sinking ship. Straddled with $7.9 billion in debt, the need to
cut about 1,500 jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident=
ial
and industrial customers, Freeman's decision to take on the role of managin=
g
LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task. Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP
with an aggressive reorganization in mind, including the primary goal of
lowering rates and becoming debt-free by 2003.

Early on, Freeman made a critical decision=01*one that in hindsight appears
to be flawless=01*for LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the state's th=
ree
IOUs (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) continued down the treacherous path of=20
restructuring.
While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means
of averting market power issues (due to agreements established with the
CPUC) LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State=
s
electing to keep the integrated utility model. In addition, Freeman blocked
ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWP's trading
unit, and thus maintained control over the muni's generation assets.

Enter the summer of California's discontent. With demand on an unexpected
increase and supplies in questionable availability, LADWP found itself
having the upper hand. The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl=
y
has favored generators, and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies
that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand. Critics accuse=
d
LADWP of "profiteering," but Freeman contended that the utility was just
taking advantage of California's flawed market. The truth is that LADWP
was in the right place at the right time, and maximized its ability to
generate cash via power trading, which it used to drive down its debt.
A shrewd move by any estimation.

The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season, illustrated
by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards. Some report=
s
indicate that LADWP earned about $45 million just from surplus power over
the course of the summer. These profits only added to what LADWP had made
in the previous year. Fiscal year 1999 wholesale energy marketing and=20
transmission
services generated $98 million, which, along with other sources of wholesal=
e
revenue, marked a growth of 118-percent over 1998.

The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped
with the onset of cooler temperatures. Ongoing structural problems within
the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and
warnings of sudden increases in prices. As noted, the state continues to
face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has
been forced off, including a substantial amount from plants that had expire=
d
air emissions credits. A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwest=01*a=
nother
carry over problem from the summer=01*also has complicated the situation in
California.

And, while the state IOUs evaluate long-terms contracts with energy provide=
rs
(based on today's high prices), LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv=
e
generation plan. Among its objectives are to add 2,900 MW of power generati=
on
within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin. The end result of
this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant
supply available at times of peak demand. Also high on the list of Freeman'=
s
priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative
energy sources. Already demonstrating a good record for green power, LADWP
wants to cut its NOx  emissions at its in-basin plants by 65 percent by
2010. Toward that end, just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte=
d
for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los
Angeles area. The first 250 kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver=
ed
in the fourth quarter of 2001, and the second in the first quarter of 2002.
A previously ordered 250 kW fuel cell power plant, announced last year,
is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of 2001.


Along with having no worries about supply, LADWP customers also can look
forward to a 5-percent rate reduction that should take effect by 2002,
followed by a 10-percent rate reduction that has been proposed for 2003.
As criticism continues to mount against California's competitive wholesale
market, it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting
out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago.

EEI's State Restructuring Service Web Site was just launched last month and 
recorded over 11,000 hits in October.  We think that if you are at all 
interested in what's going in restructuring states in response to 
California's ongoing demand/supply imbalance, market problems in several 
other states, you would be interested in EEI's new Web site.

The State Restructuring Service includes:

o  News and analyses of noteworthy legislative, regulatory and judicial 
decisions as they occur
o  Implementation decisions in restructuring states
o  Noteworthy restructuring-related actions in other states, even if not of 
comprehensive scope
o  E-mail notification of all noteworthy restructuring and related actions
o  E-mails are posted to the Web site's Action Alerts section within 24 hours
o  Site's Action Alerts are browsable and fully searchable
o  Hyperlinks to all Web posted source documents are provided
o  Policy overviews and analyses of all comprehensive restructuring laws and 
regulatory decisions

The service includes e-mail notification of breaking restructuring actions, 
as well as full access to the Web site.  For those who just need a heads up 
about noteworthy state policy actions, the e-mail service is available as a 
separate stand-alone service (free to members) or for half the price of the 
full Web service.  We cover all aspects of restructuring the electric utility 
industry and the implementation of retail electricity competition at the 
state level from the comprehensive laws, to regulatory and judicial decisions.

Availability --------------------------->

The Web site is available to EEI members (free of charge) and to anyone else 
for a fee at:

Late Wednesday, FERC issued a notice scheduling the Staff Conference focusing 
on pipeline affiliate issues.  The roundtable conference will take place on 
Wednesday, January 31 at 1:00 p.m. (note that FERC does not intend for this 
to be an all-day conference).  Preliminary comments and requests to 
participate are due by January 5, 2001.  [There is an INGAA Regulatory Policy 
Committee meeting this Thursday, November 30, in Washington, DC, in which the 
pipelines' approach to this conference will be discussed and organized.  
Shelley Corman is Chair of that committee.}

The purpose of the conference, as stated in Order No. 637, is to discuss how 
changes in the natural gas market may impact the Commission's regulation of 
pipelines and their affiliates and non-affiliates, as well as capacity 
holders and their affiliates, capacity managers and agents.  The conference 
is structured as a roundtable debate with no opening remarks from 
participants, though Staff requests parties to "provide input on how to 
structure the discussion."  Over the past month or so, Staff has spoken with 
industry representatives on the structure of this conference, aware that the 
subject matter lends itself to the possibility of an unproductive grudge 
match among industry sectors.  Staff is requesting comments before the 
roundtable to inform the structure and substance of the roundtable as led by 
Staff.

The notice asks that parties submit written comments by January 5th to 
identify issues and examples to foster a meaningful dialog and to suggest 
questions the Staff moderator may wish to pose to the panel.  Comments should 
include a one-page single spaced position summary and whether the commentor 
is interested in participating in the roundtable.  Like-minded entities are 
encouraged to select one spokesperson (ie, pipelines, LDCs, producers).

The broad question in the notice is whether the current standards of conduct 
need to be eliminated, expanded or modified based on the changing nature of 
the industry, and whether there should be uniform standards for all holders 
of pipeline capacity, or do distinctions need to be made in the treatment of 
affiliate relationships (and ownership rules) between the gas and electric 
industries.

The notice also delineates some specific areas of concern for comment.  
Boiling them down to the main questions, these are:

(1) Current Regulatory Approach:  Are current standards effective; discuss 
successful or unsuccessful experiences; do current reporting mechanisms allow 
for effective affiliate market activity monitoring?

(2) Potential Concerns:  Whether and when do affiliate transactions pose the 
potential for anticompetitive or discriminatory effects, or explain why such 
effects are not likely?  PROVIDE EXAMPLES OR SCENARIOS.  Do different types 
of affiliates (LDC, gas/power marketer, power gen, asset manager) pose 
different risks?  What are the effects of the changing market conditions, and 
is there potential for market or consumer benefits from affiliate 
transactions? 

(3) Potential Approaches:  Are there better methods to regulate affiliate 
transactions beyond the standards of conduct and reporting requirements?  
What are costs and potential adverse impacts of the following possible 
alternatives: open and fair bidding procedures; prohibitions on affiliates 
holding capacity on affiliated pipelines; limits on affiliate capacity market 
share; changes to open-season bidding to break-up large capacity packages; 
divestiture of affiliates.  "Similar approaches could be considered for 
affiliates of non-pipeline capacity holders."   Comment on the following 
possible adverse impacts of such alternatives: risk of unsubscribed capacity; 
potential cost shifts; lack of affiliate contracts to underpin new 
construction projects.

The full FERC notice (PL00-1-000, November 22, 2000) is attached here.

Late yesterday, Steve Kean assembled a meeting of staff from across business 
units to discuss the legal and regulatory implications of current events in 
California.   Here are the notes I captured from the meeting.

Background:
The hard cap is still in place in Calif. electric market at this time 
(although the FERC has proposed moving to a soft cap under which prices above 
the cap would be allowed if cost justified).  As of yesterday, electricity is 
still flowing out of the state.   The governor has asked people to cut back 
on their electric usage, including Christmas lights.  With rolling brown-outs 
a possibility, there is a belief that people will go ahead an sell power at 
high prices above the hard cap, counting on the soft cap (i.e. regulators 
wanting generator to keep running at high-prices if that is what it takes to 
keep going).  But, this causes an interesting dilemma under which generators 
which have $5-6 gas are better off selling their gas, as only generators that 
can show a $27 gas price would be able to charge market electric rates.  
Parties with $5-6 gas are better off reselling the gas for another use.
Delivered gas at Cal. border is $26-27 ($33.75 today) for the remainder of 
the month, $19 for Jan. base load and $8 summer deliveries.
It was reported that SoCal gas has been buying $24 gas to fill up storage 
this week to get ready for cold weather/increased loads next week.  This 
doesn't completely track with ETS understanding that SoCal was withdrawing 
gas from storage this week.

Issue:
ENA is  worried about two things:
Whether it is prudent to sell generation at high prices counting on the 
ability under the soft cap to demonstrate that costs exceed $150/MW.
Whether gas will be curtailed & if so what are ENA's obligations

EES is likewise concerned about curtailments to its customers (utilities have 
been curtailing, but not yet down to the core level).    If EES is curtailed 
by the utility, they don't have an obligation to the industrial to keep 
serving them.   But if the utility is operating under the diversion section 
of its tariff to meet core customers needs, the utility can require that the 
marketer keep their gas on or pay a penalty.  ENA is EES' supplier.  If EES 
load is cut, ENA might face the choice of keeping the gas on and being paid a 
diversion payment or paying a penalty under the utility tariff.

Action Steps:
Steve formed a task force to study how curtailment/diversion/force majeure 
risks play out at each chain across the gas and electric grid in California.  
Once completed, he wants to undertake this analysis for the east coast, 
Alberta, TX and Florida regions.
Develop a PR campaign.  Steve's preference would be to get out early with a 
message about what is going on in the California gas market.  In essence, he 
would like to be on the offensive with a message that the problem is (1) that 
utilities are gambling with ratepayer money -- not filling storage, not 
entering fixed price deals; and (2) the electric price cap is also causing 
strange behavior in the markets.   The ENA traders do not support this 
strategy.  They prefer to lay low, arguing that the PR strategy did not work 
in the California electric market.

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy

I just tried out the new computer down in Jean's office and it works great - 
much faster, and things print from FERC and Lexis without kicking you out of 
the computer afterwards or screwing up the print fonts.

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

The disclosure proposed for the 3rd Quarter Noteholders' report is the exact 
same wording as was used in the 2nd Qtr Noteholders' Report and is consistent 
with the language and level of detail insisted upon by AA and used in the 
1999 NNG Audited Financial Statements (Brown Cover Report).  Although AA has 
no say in what we include in the Noteholders Reports, I believe our Offering 
Circulars require that we use GAAP for interim financial reports, even though 
they are unaudited.

Dear General Counsels:

The attachments are Westlaw October allocations and Lexis-Nexis September 
Usage (Actuals) reports.  Please feel free to call me if you have any 
questions.

   

We had an amendment to Westlaw contract to include Public Records and Dow 
Jones/Company News with current $14,000 monthly rate in August.   As of 
today, I am still working with Westlaw to get Aug. and Sept. charges to 
reflect the changes (total about $5,000 credit).  I apologize for not having 
the corrected Westlaw invoices to do Aug. and Sept. allocation reports to 
you.   

October Lexis Nexis Usage report has not coming yet.  August one, according 
to Julie Pechersky was sent to me but got lost in the mail.  I am in the 
process having Lexis to send us another copy.   Again I apologize for the 
long wait even it's not under my control.

Thanks,
Sylvia Hu

Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM

To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil 
and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead 
reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and 
pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. 

In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue 
its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference 
attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their 
skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its 
production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. 
The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the 
Houston audience. 

"In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry," he said, pointing 
to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford 
Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping 
all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things 
upside down. 

When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. 
It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to 
do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, 
packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy 
companies are now adopting that method. 

In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy 
industry. "We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them 
the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
over the industry." 

Enron, which has had a shareholder return of 1,333% in 10 years (January 1990 
to November 2000), saw the changes required by new technology and 
deregulation and redefined its core competencies, which grew from its 
pipeline business. Skilling said to remain successful, the Houston-based 
corporation plans to continue to morph. 

"It all hinges on one good idea Enron had in the 1980s, that vertically 
integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were 
starting to break up. In the energy industry, the reason was deregulation. 
Fundamentally, this is a better business structure for two reasons: you can 
be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much 
more quickly." 

Instead of bigger energy companies, Skilling said he expects to see many 
smaller companies, "maybe thousands tied together electronically and 
vertically." The transformation and interaction costs are "collapsing across 
the economy." As an example of interaction costs, Skilling used bank tellers. 
In 1985, it cost a bank $1.50 a transaction. To bank on the Internet today, 
it costs a bank less than a penny. 

This drop in interaction costs is a major reason Enron finds the bandwidth 
market so attractive. In 1995, the length of time to provision bandwidth was 
six to eight months. Today, it's two to three months. And next year, Skilling 
predicts it will take one second. 

"We will have bandwidth on demand by next year," he said, and added that 
Enron plans to be the leader in the field. 

Similarly, long-term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to 
execute. In 1989, they took nine months. Three years ago, they took two weeks 
to execute. Today, using EnronOnline and other similar Internet trading 
systems, it takes less than one second. 

"All of the sudden the world has changed. We have the same manufacture cost, 
but interactive costs collapse. I think that because of this, we'll see the 
collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world," 
Skilling said. 

To survive, Skilling advised companies to "virtually reintegrate" what they 
need. "If you have an old vertically integrated mind set, it's tough. Give it 
up. I know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves. I 
don't get it. It makes no sense whatsoever. You can get it online at the 
lowest cost. If your business strategy is dependent on this, it will be a 
very hard row to hoe." 

Each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10 
years, predicted the Enron president. "You're not just competing against 
three people in West Texas, but thousands around the world." 

Opportunities exist, he said, for those companies that "go with the flow and 
find ways to compete. Create low cost, dependable market interfaces...provide 
packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures, 
differentiation and customization." 

The only threat is from the old way of doing business, he said. "But there is 
tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you've never been able to 
do." He suggested a "new" energy model based on brainpower, networking, 
offering real options to customers, moving quickly and being entrepreneurial. 

"At Enron, this has been the whole premise: to be able to change by 
responding and reacting to the environment. By getting components together 
and packaging them for the customer."

As you may recall we have been arguing with the MN Dept. of Revenue for years 
over whether or not natural gas used as a compressor fuel was subject to the 
Minnesota use tax.  Great Lakes has been in court with the DOR over this same 
issue.  Today I received the following, which is an internal memo that was 
circulated in the Dorsey & Whitney law firm, which has been representing 
Great Lakes announcing a favorable ruling.

Good morning, everyone!

Many of you have called or emailed me about Lexis and Westlaw Luncheon 
invitations I sent with past dates.  Those were sent by Andrew Wu to you last 
night.  Andrew Wu is in EES Legal.  Last night, his emails in his inbox were 
altered to "send" status and you all received my old emails about various 
Lexis and Westlaw lunchoen we already had in the past few months.   Enron 
Global Messaging Center is aware of the problem and will fix it soon.  I 
apologize for the inconvenience and confusion it has caused you.   But I 
learn that many of you are interested in Lexis Cyberlaw training.  I'll 
coordinate with Lexis Corporate Attorney to do one in the near future.   I 
will send out invitation when I have the date scheduled.

Thanks,

25th

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.

Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants; Match for Entergy
in New York
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy,
and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced
that Constellation Nuclear will buy 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82 percent
of Unit 2. Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine Mile Point's
1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The total purchase price, including
fuel, is $815 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclea=
r
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the New York Public Utilities Commission
still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase, but Constellation
Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid-2001.

ANALYSIS: This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever=
al
reasons. First, the purchase of the plants expands Constellation's generati=
on
assets, which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the
last year. Secondly, the location of the plants is a critical factor.=20
Constellation
has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region, and New
York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing
field for nuclear assets. Third, owning the Nine Mile Point plants will
elevate Constellation's stature, moving it ever close to become on par
with its nearest competitor in the New York market, Entergy Corp.

Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move
for Constellation Nuclear, let me establish some of the important factors
of the deal. Nine Mile Point is a two-unit boiling water reactor site.
Nine Mile 1 began producing electricity in 1969; Nine Mile 2 began producin=
g
electricity in 1988. The two units are both located in Scriba, N.Y., which
is about 40 miles north of Syracuse. The Nine Mile Point units have had
rather spotty histories, but over the last two years have shown signs of
becoming strong performers. Niagara Mohawk operates both units.

Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several
different utility owners. Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of
Unit 1. Unit 2 is owned by a group of co-owners: Niagara Mohawk (41 percent=
),
New York State Electric & Gas (18 percent), Rochester Gas & Electric=20
Corporation
(14 percent), and Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation (9 percent).
It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase
82 percent of Unit 2 because the Long Island Power Authority, an additional
co-owner that controls 18 percent of Unit 2, has opted not to sell its
share of the plant at this time.

The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service
Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market
value of their plants through an open, competitive process. This is part
of an overall effort to separate generation, transmission and distribution
activities within the state.

With that established, I will continue to support my case that the acquisit=
ion
of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energy's
growth strategy. In early 2000, Constellation began a restructuring of
its corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments:
one focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclea=
r)
and the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant
energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power
in the third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding
this growth. The goal for the merchant energy business, according to=20
Constellation
Energy CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000
MW of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellatio=
n
Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage
of "bargain prices for nuclear plants," which resulted in large part from
other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing,
or being mandated, to divest their generation plants.

Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group,
a unit within Constellation Nuclear, was established when Baltimore Gas
& Electric, another Constellation Energy subsidiary, created a new area
for its life-cycle license renewal activities. Thus, most likely Constellat=
ion
will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units,
and has a core group of people with expertise in this area. License renewal=
s
in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC, so there shoul=
d
not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process. The
only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe=
nt
in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC.

Presently, Constellation's generation assets are based in a mixture of
coal and nuclear. The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making
expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset, an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant
in Southern Maryland. As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the
foreseeable future, buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and
nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases. Thus, Constellation could
be in a prime position if the desire for nuclear-generated power continues
to rise, as the company anticipates. While Constellation will most likely
retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company is clearly moving
closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio. Constellation has justified its
move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear
fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that "the economics [of
nuclear] are quite robust, once they are calculated out."

A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea=
ses
is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a 10-year contract to provide
electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices. Specific terms
of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of its
share of the Nine Mile Point plants' output back to the sellers at an avera=
ge
price of nearly $35/MWh until 2010. This alone should provide a solid rate
of return for Constellation's merchant energy business.

In addition, as I indicated, the New York location is key factor in this
deal. Aside from its large population, the state of New York is home to
a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently. For these
two reasons alone, New York stands out as the center within Constellation's
focus on the Northeastern United States. Yet, Constellation's competitors
also have the same plan, and have all fought to gain assets in the region.


Just within the last few months, Entergy Corp.=01*which also has based its
strategy to a large extent on nuclear=01*has been aggressively making its
own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State. In fact, Entergy
was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders
for the Nine Mile Point plants. I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor=
d,
an Entergy spokesperson, back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was
actively attempting to purchase the two plants. However, despite the loss
of the two Nine Mile Point plants, Entergy retains a very strong nuclear
presence in New York. In late November, Entergy closed the sale on the
New York Power Authority's two nuclear power plants, Indian Point Unit
3 in Westchester County and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County=
.
In fact, the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest=20
acquisition
to date in Entergy's nuclear strategy, and also represented the highest
purchase price ($967 million) ever of a nuclear asset. Earlier in the same
month, Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point 2 plant from Con
Edison. Altogether, Entergy now controls over 3,000 MW of nuclear generatio=
n
in the state of New York.

Consequently, since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of
the top nuclear power producers in the industry, it will need to match
Entergy (along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke) with regard
to its nuclear portfolio. There is only a limited number of nuclear plants
that will become available for purchase, and thus any acquisition of an
operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in
this particular market.

As a sidenote, I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary
sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants (100 percent of Unit 1 and 41 percent
of Unit 2). It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir=
ed
by National Grid, a U.K. company that is considered one of the world's
largest independent transmission companies. The acquisition of Niagara
Mohawk is supporting National Grid's strategy of becoming a major presence
in the transmission and distribution sectors of the U.S. energy industry.
Generation is not a high priority for National Grid, and the sale of Niagar=
a
Mohawk's nuclear assets resulted from this strategy.

Moreover, once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches
that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States.
Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawk's current strategy,
it is a key component for Constellation Energy. There are certainly risks
associated with both approaches, but the bottom line on this deal, from
my perspective, is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets
in a strong market. It's pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be
a contender in the nuclear arena, especially in New York, and owning the
two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal.

Thanks, Drew.  That's consistent with my thinking, but I wanted to hear it 
straight from the expert.

Subject: Re: Citizens request for proposal  

I'm not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a 
service for Citizens.  We can't actually buy the assets without a FERC 
certificate, but that's not what you are suggesting.   I can think of one 
example on NN in which Northwestern Pub. Service owns a some branch lines and 
we operate them.  Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a 
strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream 
out of the regulated pipeline entity.  Since TW doesn't have a rate case 
until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate 
entitiy until we get down the road a ways.

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

I thought that was the point of requesting a December 1 date -- so that the 
Commission had a longer period to act.  Since we requested an effective date 
with more than 30 days advance notice (but less than 60 days per 154.207 of 
the regs), then the Commission has until the effective date to act? ( NGA 
717c.)

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their 
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp 
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce 
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. 
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to 
shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were 
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel 
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San 
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow 
new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies 
last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to 
solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, 
they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical 
problem and into a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single 
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a 
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating plants 
and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, chief 
executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the 
organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  "You 
can't look at these things in isolation." 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company, 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of 
industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In 
California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas, 
and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating 
plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the 
older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't 
like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they 
burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power  
plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short 
of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including 
many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair 
after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to 
begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and 
not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because 
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last 
summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of 
gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices 
also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal 
units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8% 
from a year ago. 

"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said 
John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of 
Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based 
on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.  

High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In 
California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the 
price a year earlier.

Peace Software Lands MidAmerican Energy Account
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Peace Software, a global provider of leading e-business solutions for retai=
l
energy companies, announced that MidAmerican Energy Company, a supplier
of energy in the Midwest's deregulating market, has selected Peace's Energy
software suite for a rapid entry into multiple deregulated markets. "Peace
Energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas
customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels,
services and locations on a single statement," said Todd Raba, vice preside=
nt
of market and sales at MidAmerican Energy.

ANALYSIS: This could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both
companies. On the national or international stage, Des Moines, Iowa-based
MidAmerican may not be considered a major player. Yet, within the Midwest,
it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence. The company and
its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than 10,000 MW of=20
diversified
power generation facilities around the world, providing both regulated
and unregulated electric and natural-gas services to more than 1.3 million
customers in six states and the United Kingdom (through its Northern Electr=
ic
& Gas subsidiary). In August, MidAmerican made its move into Ohio, the
fourth largest U.S. market in terms of customers (behind California, Texas
and Florida), indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow
in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive
Midwest market. Just last Monday, MidAmerican became the first energy compa=
ny
to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier (CRES) in
the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. territory in southwest Ohio.

An essential element to the utility's growth is a comprehensive billing
software system, which is where the value of Peace Software comes in.=20
According
to MidAmerican, it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy
usage and billing data on a 24/7 basis. Also important to MidAmerican as
it enters different states is the elimination of "several automated and
manual processes required by our current system." This can result in a
real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office
functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes, all
of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software.
In this particular case, Peace's Energy software will provide to MidAmerica=
n
customers several self-serve features, including customer enrollment, summa=
ry
billing, more flexible due dates and electronic payment options. The Energy
System was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling
many functions required by retailers, from enrollment and registration
to billing to settlement and load forecasting. The last two features are
particularly noteworthy as, up to this point, they have been rarely found
in billing software. Many systems in the United States today are building
this competency or are "bolting on" the technology; Peace already offers
it in a "one-stop-shop" tool.

Peace Software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra=
cts
prior to this one with MidAmerican, including Enron, BC Gas, Dominion Retai=
l,
Nordic Electric, Exelon Energy, and Pepco Services. The company is based
in Atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin, New
Zealand, the first country to deregulate its electric utilities.

I spoke with Brian Peace, CEO of Peace Software, last June and he gave
an overview of how the Energy System functions. First, the Energy System
is centered around the UNIX operating system and thus can be moved and
upgraded from one hardware platform to another. Since its start in 1988,
Peace Software has designed the Energy System around a multiple-product
architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water, gas and
electricity into one product suite. Currently, the system handles not only
those three commodities, but also can consolidate billing information relat=
ed
to telecommunications, home security, home mortgaging and other value-added
commodities and services. The end result is that an energy service provider
can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost, which is
a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing.

At the time of our discussion, Peace said, "ESPs can no longer just rely
on a commodity margin anymore. They've got to be able to buy it at the
right price, combine it with the right services and then deliver it in
a very convenient way to the customers. This is the path to being competiti=
ve
and profitable."

Over the last decade, Peace Software gained a real lock on the New Zealand
market, and began selling its technology in the United States in 1997.
That same year the company secured a contract with Enron, which at the
time owned Portland General and was attempting to penetrate the California
retail market. Of course, Enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin=
g
efforts in California, but still uses the Peace Energy software as it=20
continues
to penetrate other markets. Peace Software's alliance with InSITE=01*a New
York-based application service provider=01*has led to providing the softwar=
e
for the billing needs of Exelon. Brian Peace has said that for all of these
utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they
can market to new customers.

Of course, although Peace Software's contract with MidAmerican certainly
elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the Midwest market,
the billing software business presents stiff competition. Perhaps the two
greatest competitors for Peace Software are SCT and Excelergy. SCT offers
the SCT Banner product, which was originally created to bill multiple=20
commodity
customers in the utility environment and has done quite well. ENLOGIX uses
the SCT Banner system to support multi-services across its client base
including gas, financing, ancillary products, electricity, water, and solid
waste. Excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the Northeast
while Peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of New Zealand and
Australia. Peace Software and Excelergy also have recently made their own
inroads into the gas markets. Peace has entered the Canadian gas market
by implementing its Energy software product at BC Gas, headquartered in
Vancouver, which serves about 750,000 customers. Excelergy has implemented
its billing product at Boston Gas, which serves about 535,000 customers.


As competitive ESPs attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets=
,
one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multi-faceted billing
and customer care system. Facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers,
customers may be more enticed to select an ESP that offers the value-added
service offerings found in software developed by Peace and its competitors.
MidAmerican has branded itself with the tag line "Obsessively, Relentlessly
At Your Service." The company is obviously making customer service a=20
centerpiece
of its competitive strategy by adopting the Peace Energy software suite
to support its entry into new markets.

We need to make sure this upside doesn't get taken in 2000.  It is part of 
the 2001 plan.  What ideas do we have for reserving equivlaent dollars?  the 
TC swap? depending on the outcome of the Carlton order, we may have a couple 
hundred thousand there?  we need to discuss how we want this treated for when 
it gets to Rod-  MK

Subject: Re: SSL Abandonment - Sale to El Paso  

I had a meeting with El Paso the afternoon of Nov. 6th to discuss the 
abandonment, and the "next steps"

El Paso agrees to shoot for a November 30, 2000 close, with them assuming 
commercial and revenue responsibility on December 1st.  I requested funds 
transfer to NNG on the first business day of Jan 2001.

All exhibits to the P&SA are collected and being made available to legal for 
incorporation into closing documents.  These include MMS ROW's, space lease 
agreements on  three platforms, and a surviving NNG/Sea Gull transport 
agreement.

Robert Newman with EGC has contacted El Paso field operations and they have 
developed a list of information operations will transfer to El Paso regarding 
pipeline Ass Builts, maintenance information,. metering activity, MMS safety 
inspections, corrosion control, leak histories, etc.

Preliminary worksheet showing the "Adjusted Price" was developed and agreed 
to with El Paso.  Estimate of proceeds at the time of closing will be 
$1,357,107.00.  This was developed using estimates for the last three months 
revenue stream, and four month of O&M.  The final number will be developed 
and routed internally once actual variable are known.  Due to the transition 
to SAP, queries be expense code are more difficult to obtain.

If you should have any questions or need any information please let me know.

Thanks, Bob

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy

Thanks Jeff, ETS Operations would be glad to look at these and any other 
"potential" opportunity to operate 3rd party facilities. Don Hawkins is 
heading up the "endless possibilities" for us. I did copy him on this reply, 
Don is based in Houston. 

I 'am currently in Amarillo Texas with the SW Operation Directors and I will 
discuss this with Rich.

THANKS for the partnership.

		 Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

First,  I thought the inservice was to be earlier than 3rd quarter??  confused
Second, on term I'd suggest we say a minimum of five years, so if someone 
wants to bid for a longer term they can--
Third, in the 3rd paragraph change the reference to term, to as specifed 
above-
Fourth, in the last paragraph, add minimum term of five years again.

Enron Offers to Buy Out Azurix
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Enron Corp. announced that it has offered up to $275 million in funding
to take Azurix Corp. (NYSE: AZX) private at a buy-out price of $7 per share=
.
Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 percent of Azurix, a global
water company that owns, operates and manages water and wastewater assets
and provides related services. The specific structure and timing of Enron's
proposal has yet to be determined, but the company's board is now consideri=
ng
the proposal.

ANALYSIS: Azurix has been plagued with operational and financial problems
over the last 12 months, culminating in the departure of its former CEO
Rebecca Mark in late August. Enron had established Azurix in July 1998
with a $2.4 billion acquisition of Britain's Wessex Water, which provides
water and wastewater services to a U.K. population of approximately 3.5
million. Operating primarily in the United Kingdom and Latin America=20
(Argentina
and Brazil), Azurix was intended to be Enron's vehicle to capitalize on
what it perceived to be favorable market conditions for water investments.


Yet, Azurix has not been a profitable operation for Enron, and has been
seen as a real anomaly when compared against Enron's consistent success
in its other ventures (for example, EnronOnline). For instance, Azurix
reported year-end 1999 net income of $67 million, significantly under=20
projections
for what Enron had hoped for the subsidiary. After months of speculation,
Mark stepped down both as Azurix CEO and from the Enron board of directors,
and was replaced by John Garrison, Jr. Mark maintained throughout her tenur=
e
as CEO of Azurix that the company needed time to develop core assets and
capabilities. However, this approach was in stark contrast to Enron's guidi=
ng
philosophy=01*as espoused by COO Jeffrey Skilling=01*which has moved the co=
mpany
away from owning hard assets. Skilling also believed that, although acquiri=
ng
the Wessex operation gave Azurix the engineering capability and industry
knowledge to participate in the water business, privatization of the water
industry has slowed down considerably since the company began to penetrate
this market. Instead of pursuing a capital-intensive strategy for Azurix,
Skilling wanted Azurix to become more of a service-oriented business. This
change in business direction coincided with the departure of Mark.

Yet, Azurix has continued to flounder even since Mark left. In the third
quarter of this year, Enron reportedly lost $128 million in its "corporate
and other" category and attributed a fourth of the loss to the Azurix=20
operation.
Azurix's stock price started a marked decline in early August when it was
announced that annual results would not meet analysts' expectations. While
Azurix was taken public in June 1999 at a price of $19 per share, it curren=
tly
is priced at $6 1/4 (at close of the markets on Oct. 30). This is an=20
approximately
$3 increase from what Azurix had been trading at recently, presumably due
to Enron's announcement of the proposed buyout.

Enron's buyout offer comes after four unnamed parties approached Enron
about buying its stake in Azurix. Reportedly, three out of the four potenti=
al
buyers were unwilling to pay more than $4 per share, although one of the
buyers initially considered an offer of $7 per share, but ultimately decide=
d
against the purchase. Enron's motivation in returning Azurix to a private
status is probably one of protecting its shareholders. Enron pointed out
in its announcement that shareholders would receive, on a timely basis,
a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price of
the shares at which Azurix has traded over the last several months.

Making matters worse for Enron, a group of plaintiffs, represented by New
York law firm Wechsler Harwood Halebian & Feffer LLP, have initiated a
class-action lawsuit against Azurix in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages
on behalf of all investors who purchased Azurix stock during the period
of June 9, 1999 (the date of Azurix's IPO) and Aug. 8, 2000, and who "suffe=
red
damages as a result." The law firm is claiming that Azurix violated the
Federal securities laws. I placed a call to the law firm this morning in
hopes of getting additional information about what the class-action suit
entails. Unfortunately, I did not receive a call back before press time.


The consensus among the vast majority of U.S. energy companies is that
the profitability of water as a convergence strategy is questionable. The
most obvious negative about the water business is that it most likely will
remain a heavily regulated delivery business, offering few opportunities
for private companies to penetrate the market. Water is a very staid busine=
ss
that seems inconsistent with Enron's aggressive growth strategy. After
Enron secures a fair return for Azurix's shareholders, it is not clear
what the company will do with its water subsidiary, but I would not be
surprised if Azurix is sold to another company. However, in August=01*right
before Mark's departure=01*Azurix announced that it had begun a pilot progr=
am
in the Lower Rio Grande using its Internet exchange Water2Water.com. The
site will provide users with information, price transparency and efficiency
in water exchanges. This announcement indicated that Azurix would begin
trading water rights, adding this commodity to the growing list of Enron's
traded commodities (energy, telecom, weather derivatives, etc.). So it
may be the case that Enron keeps Azurix, but turns it into a water trading
operation as opposed to water and wastewater services. In any case, the
present objective for Enron will be financing the buyout and ensuring that
Azurix's shareholders receive a significant premium to the market price
of Azurix. Enron also wants to ensure other benefits to Azurix, including
a significant near-term reduction in Azurix's general and administrative
expenses, greater certainty to Azurix's customers and employees and increas=
ed
flexibility for restructuring Azurix's assets and business.

Senate Calls for Hearing into High Gas Prices

There appears to be one issue that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill 
can agree on --- gas prices are too high. Chairman Frank H. Murkowski (R-AK) 
of the Senate Energy Committee and Ranking Minority Member Jeff Bingaman 
(D-NM) have called for an oversight hearing to look into rising natural gas 
prices. 

The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 12 in Senate Dirksen 366. 
Appearing before the committee will be representatives of the gas industry 
and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. 

"Spot prices for natural gas on Dec. 6 hit $9.54/MMBtu. That compares to a 
price a year ago of about $2.16/Btu," said Murkowski. "We are concerned about 
both price and availability of supply as we move into the winter months."

First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that 
used to be IT.
It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A 
receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff 
allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated 
us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they 
determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.  
Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

Dan,

I'll check with ENA again on the currency swap.  I have spoken with the a 
couple of times about these and they indicate that it is being circulated 
through Law on their side (very slow).
The Lyons base gas sale contract will be a fixed price sale contract pursuant 
to NNG's rate schedule SF (I would not consider this contract to be a 
derivative, it is a sale pursuant to an approved FERC rate schedule).  Morgan 
is working with Legal to create this contract.
I thought that the NNG/TW amendment of terms had been completed.  I'll check 
with Drew, and if they are not completed we should be able to complete these 
in a couple of days (thanks for the heads-up)
Regarding the October purchase contracts: I'll forward this to Morgan for his 
handling of that issue.
Regarding the monthly sale to Kansas Gas:  I'm not familiar with this 
agreement???

I'll be in Houston on Monday and Tuesday if you want to catch me on any of 
these issues.

Kent

Subject: Derivatives missing confirmations or contracts

Here is the current status of known derivative contracts which have 
outstanding paperwork. 

1. ENA Canadian Dollar Swap, - Kent Miller sent an e-mail to ENA he has 
received no response.
2. Oxy forward sale on Lyons base gas withdraw.  - We need a copy of this 
contract.  This contract is a derivative, we are using the 10 b. exclusion 
but we need to document that the contract qualifies for this exclusion.  
Otherwise the contract will need to be MTM.
3. NNG/TW intercompany amendment of terms for TransCanada.  

Also we need to remind everyone that gas purchases need an underlying 
contract.  AA has scheduled an audit of our gas purchases, additionally 
purchases cannot be approved without an underlying contract.

We have two purchases made for Oct. gas in which we could not locate an 
underlying contract.  
They are:
1. TransCanada
2. OGE 

Please forward all gas purchase base underlying contracts to Mark Walton.

We also are making monthly sales at Cunningham on a delivery into Kansas 
Gas.  I don't have a contract nor do we receive enough information on this 
sale to determine if the value received is correct.  Do you wish for us to be 
involved in the administration of this sale or can I leave this to Morgan.

Subject: Re: TW options filing  

I thought that was the point of requesting a December 1 date -- so that the 
Commission had a longer period to act.  Since we requested an effective date 
with more than 30 days advance notice (but less than 60 days per 154.207 of 
the regs), then the Commission has until the effective date to act? ( NGA 
717c.)

At this mornings staff meeting, Stan asked about the status of TW options 
filing,  Shelley indicated that she felt it would be on the Nov 21 st 
agenda.  The 30 days to act is up on Nov. 16th, if the FERC hasn't done 
anything aren't the tariff sheets approved as filed?? If that answer is yes,  
isn't an order after that date required to meet the SS 5 requirements??   
Just thinking about the timing-  MK

Steve - is Leslie Launer(sp?) an Enron employee?   I know she once was, but I 
believe she lives in New Mexico and is used by Enron at times.  Do we use 
her?  What is her status and relationship with the pipeline group??

Do you get any reports from Tom Rutherford on New Mexico??

AUGIE E-NEWS
October 25, 2000
Volume 1, Number 4
**************************
Augie E-News is a bi-monthly (or as needed) newsletter sent to alumni of
Augustana College informing them of the latest news from campus.
**************************

***Viking Days 2000 - Thanks for Coming Home!:
October 6-8 was quite the weekend for Augustana.  It began with the
inauguration of Dr. Bruce Halverson '66 as Augustana's 22nd
President.  Cold weather didn't keep alumni away from the parade. And the
football game against NDSU was a good fight.  We inducted the Class of
1950 into the Honor Guard at the Heritage Honor Luncheon and honored
outstanding individuals at the Athletic Hall of Fame Banquet on Friday
night and at the Alumni Banquet on Saturday night.  Viking Varieties was a
hit in the Sioux Falls Arena and the crowd was great at the Afterglow,
complete with music by President Halverson and the Fabulous Jadesmen and
Doc Krueger and the Alumni Brass Choir.  Click on
http://www.augie.edu/alumni/homecoming.html for pictures from the
weekend.  Class pictures can be found at the "Reunions Site" under each
class year. Plan now to attend Viking Days 2001, October 5-7.  The Classes
of 1936, 1941, 1946, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1991,
and 1996 will celebrate reunions.

***Joel Wudel '78 resigns as Director of Alumni Relations, Paul Krueger
'97 is Promoted:***
Effective October 15, 2000 Joel Wudel, is no longer at Augustana.  He
is moving on to other endeavors in Kansas City, MO.  Well-wishes can be
sent to his home at 4908 S Quail Run Ave, Sioux Falls, SD 57108.

Paul Krueger, who has been Associate Director of Alumni Relations the
last three years, has assumed Joel's position.  Paul graduated from
Augustana in 1997 with majors in journalism and communications.  He was
student body president his senior year and involved in many other campus
activities.  Paul's wife, Joni, works in the Admission Office at
Augie.  Paul can be reached at (605) 274-5530 or at krueger@wise.augie.edu

***Augustana and WYNCOM, Inc. present The Fifth Annual Worldwide Lessons

haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little 
questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the 
receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK

Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A 
consent agreement has been filed with the 
FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process 
prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas
assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd 
quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting 
some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated 
they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP.

El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake

El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d 
line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last 
week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would 
result in a $20 million loss. 

The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha 
market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link 
between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal 
route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. 

Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of 
compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. 

Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own 
stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm 
transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. 

Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General.

Attached below is a brochure regarding an upcoming national symposium - The
Reorganizing Energy Industry: Shifting Risks and Opportunities to take place
in Madison, Wisconsin November 29 and 30, 2000.  I am pleased to be
moderating this panel.  Given your role in this important industry, I
believe that there are good reasons why you will want to attend.
The event is sponsored by the Wisconsin Public Utility Institute, The
Federal Energy Bar Association and the Energy & Telecommunications Section
of the Wisconsin Bar and will involve nationally prominent industry
representatives as members of the faculty.  The meeting will include leading
Wall Street investment bankers, numerous regulatory commissioners from a
variety of influential jurisdictions, experts ready to discuss implications
of recent seismic events in the energy markets, and financial analysts and
credit agencies who must evaluate the business strategies of energy
companies to meet this unfolding future, and leading market participants.
 Because the energy industry remains highly regulated, it remains a
market which can be affected dramatically by a small number of people - not
just through their use of  capital in the market, but by their influence
upon the policy makers who are now setting, and will continue to set, the
rules.  The Symposium has been designed to provide an intimate forum for the
exposition and discussion of energy industry policy among a mix of people
who will influence the unfolding energy markets.  Obviously, you and your
organization need to play a leading role in these discussions and  I
sincerely hope you can participate.

Public Service Company of New Mexico to Acquire the Electric Utility 
Operations
of Western Resources
By: Jon T. Brock, Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence
===============================================================

Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) announced yesterday that it
intends to acquire the electric utility operations of Topeka, Kansas based
Western Resources (WR) in a tax-free stock-for-stock transaction.  The
deal will require that WR separate its non-utility assets from its regulated
utility business and spin it off to WR shareholders.

ANALYSIS:  In this day and age of a consolidating electric industry, strategic
combinations are becoming more commonplace.  This announcement took me
by surprise even though the signs were clearly marked for this type of
merger.  WR has had a tough time financially in recent years and has been
seeking a utility operations buyer for some time now.

WR busted up a planned merger between Kansas City based KCPL and UtiliCorp
United by attempting to acquire KCPL in 1996.  At the time WR share price
was above $30.  In 1997 WR share price soared to record highs of more than
$40.  WR attempted to acquire security company ADT but their bid failed.
 They sold their interest in ADT for a $800 million profit.  This profit
"masked" a rate review by the Kansas Corporation Commission that at the
time was cutting WR rates by $75 million, reducing earnings by 75 cents
per share.

WR, who obviously had a strategic focus on security, used the profits from
the ADT sale to purchase 85 percent of Protection One, one of the fastest
growing companies in the monitored security business.  Protection One hit
some hard times soon after the purchase by WR and as a result, their stock
tumbled.  WR investors became nervous when state and federal regulators
began discussing terms of the KCPL merger that might not necessarily be
favorable to them.  As a result, some moved their money out of WR and by
1999, WR share price had tumbled to $16 to $17.  In January of this year,
KCPL determined that the share price of WR and the financial considerations
of the merger were not advantageous to KCPL shareholders and called off
the merger.

WR immediately split itself into two organizations (regulated utility 
operations
and non-regulated business) with the intent of finding a buyer for the
regulated utility operations.  WR claimed in June of this year that 50
companies were being courted, including international companies, for the
utility operations assets of Kansas Power & Light (KPL) and Kansas Gas
and Electric (KGE).  Putting PNM on that list had not occurred to me.
But it does fit.

SCIENTECH interviewed Jeff Sterba, CEO of PNM, just weeks ago and asked
if the development of alliances, mergers, and acquisitions were a part
of the positive approach to PNM's strategy.  Jeff answered, "Very definitely.
Alliances focused on the things that are core to your business, and that
can bring a sustainable, competitive advantage are essential for us in
this industry.  The criticality of market channels can't be over-emphasized.
 Once you have a good market channel, that doesn't mean that everything
you put through that market channel you have to do yourself, or you have
to own. You can expand that reach to customers by forming alliances.  There
are times when acquisitions can also be an important investment if it involves
something that is core to your business. So, both alliances and acquisitions
will be a part of PNM's future."

Just weeks later PNM is buying WR.  Utilizing my rear view mirror now I
see the existing similarities between the assets of WR and PNM.  They both
operate regulated utilities with a generation fuel mix (including nuclear).
 They both have multi-commodity in electric and gas.  They both have wholesale
operations.  PNM actually has had a great year financially due in part
to a strong wholesale operation.  PNM net earnings for the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2000 totaled $86.9 million, or $2.17 per share (diluted)
on total operating revenues of $1.15 billion, compared to earnings of $66.2
million, or $1.60 per share in the first three quarters of 1999.

PNM has adopted a "niche" strategy in the wholesale power market by developing
tailored wholesale power products for its customers.  While some of the
mega-traders in the wholesale market thrive on volume and a standard 
commodity,
PNM differentiates itself by creating a tailored power product according
to the needs of the buyer.  PNM has found success in this niche segment
of a large wholesale market.

The merger deal is expected to take between 12 and 15 months to complete.
 PNM will inherit approximately $2.9 billion in debt making the total value
of the deal worth $4.4 billion.  Fitch has placed its securities ratings
of PNM on Rating Watch Negative and WR on Rating Watch Evolving.  Fitch
plans to meet with PNM management soon in order to assess the full impact
of the merger.  Apparently some regulatory concern exists in Kansas where
deregulation has not occurred and where some rate inconsistencies exist
between Wichita and Topeka.  This may result in a rate case.  It should
also be noted that Wichita, Kansas currently has an ongoing effort to takeover
(municipalize) the electric system from Western Resources within its city
limits because of the rate disparity between Wichita and Topeka.  Wichita
has about 170,000 power customers -- roughly a fourth of all the customers
served by Western Resources. They represent more than $370 million of KGE's
$580 million in revenues.

PNM will increase its debt but is committed to reducing that debt and has
demonstrated its ability to do so.  PNM has decreased its debt-to-capital
ratio from 72 percent to less than 55 percent in the last seven years.
 The headquarters will be based in Albuquerque, NM and the chairman, 
president,
and chief executive officer will be Jeff Sterba.

If we need to cashout for operational reasons then $500,993.10 is a fair 
price.

If we need the gas then they should pay the value of the gas which is 
estimated at $728,274.40.

So the answer is 
If we want the cashout get at least $500,993.
If they want the cashout and we need gas get $728,274.

TNPC Wins Pennsylvania Customers, Continues to Go Green
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

TNPC, Inc., parent of The New Power Company, reported that the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission approved the "Competitive Default Service Agreeme=
nt"
between The New Power Company and PECO Energy for almost 300,000 customers.
The PUC is expected to issue a final order on this matter in the next few
days.

ANALYSIS: As you may recall, a dispute erupted between TNPC and Green Mount=
ain
about a month ago over this large number of customers in PECO Energy's
service territory. Under a regulatory mandate from the Pennsylvania PUC,
PECO had initiated an auction for the approximately 300,000 residential
electricity customers who had not selected a competitive energy service
provider registered within the state. This represented about 20 percent
of PECO's residential customer base. Three energy providers=01*TNPC, Green
Mountain and one other unidentified company=01*bid for the customers with
various service packages. PECO chose TNPC, which had offered a fixed discou=
nt
of 2 percent for the residential customers, because it believed the offer
was in the best interest of PECO customers.

Green Mountain contested this decision, arguing that its hydro- and natural
gas-based energy package would ultimately be "less expensive for consumers
and environmentally cleaner." Green Mountain also claimed that its proposed
offer was a full 2 percent less than PECO's shopping credit, compared to
TNPC's offer which would average about 1.83 percent below the shopping
credit. PECO's response was that Green Mountain had missed the deadline
for the auction and consequently did not present a valid offer. Over the
last month, both Green Mountain and TNPC fought hard for PECO's customers,
which was understandable as Pennsylvania represents arguably the most=20
successful
retail market in the United States, if not the world.

The PUC ruling clearly puts the 300,000 PECO customers into the hands of
TNPC, which of course is the product of the residential retail marketing
alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM. Securing the 300,000 residential=20
customers
in one swift motion is a significant achievement for TNPC and gives it
a substantial market edge over other energy service providers in the=20
Pennsylvania
market. The customers will be randomly selected from those that have not
shopped for an alternative supplier under the state's electric competition
program.

However, what I find most interesting about the latest development in this
case is what's happening behind the scenes of the dispute, and more=20
specifically
how TNPC continues to move toward a renewables perspective. I discussed
just two weeks ago (IssueAlert from Nov. 13) that TNPC's stock (NYSE: NPW)
was taking a nosedive. Keep in mind that the stock had a terrific IPO in
early October. TNPC's IPO offering of 24 million common shares was priced
at $21 per share, a surprisingly strong showing for a company that has
only been in existence since May of this year. Momentum grew as the first
day of trading saw the stock price climb to $27.  Yet, contrast that with
the current stock price of $6 3/8 (as of Nov. 30), and certainly questions
about where TNPC will go from here start to emerge. The decline in TNPC
stock seemed to start when the company reported a 3Q loss of $69.9 million,
or $2.96 per share. TNPC argued that the losses were not meaningful due
its limited operating history, but investors seemed to think otherwise.


Around the same time that TNPC's stock began to drop, the company announced
that it would be adding wind-generated energy to its package for customers
in the Philadelphia area. Under terms of a brand-new agreement, TNPC will
market wind power supplied by Community Energy from a site under developmen=
t
in the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania. My reaction to this announcemen=
t
was that TNPC's addition of wind power to its portfolio was an attempt
to quell further objections from Green Mountain. Yet, TNPC's move toward
renewable energy now appears to be an attempt to save its sagging stock
price.

In another ironic twist, TNPC also announced that it is forming a partnersh=
ip
with Green Mountain, which was an adversary only last month. TNPC disclosed
that it is in negotiations with Green Mountain regarding the disposition
of up to 50,000 competitive default service customers (out of the 300,000)
within PECO's territory. Reportedly, the relationship will benefit=20
Pennsylvania
consumers and help TNPC and Green Mountain to achieve their business goals.
In addition, TNPC claims that working with Green Mountain in this manner
is consistent with its objective of enhancing a "positive customer portfoli=
o
value." However, considering that TNPC fought so hard to obtain all of
the 300,000 customers from PECO, it seems odd that the company would sudden=
ly
be willing to share 50,000 of them with Green Mountain.

Certainly, Green Mountain wins from this partnership. The company gains
50,000 residential customers when it, based on the PUC's ruling, could
have ended up with nothing. The company offers three service packages in
Pennsylvania: EcoSmart, EnviroBlend and Nature's Choice, varying mixes
of hydro, natural gas and new renewables, with Nature's Choice containing
more renewables than the other two power blends. Marketing power that it
bills as "dramatically cleaner than typical Pennsylvania electricity,"
Green Mountain may be able to expand its reach in the state by attracting
energy customers who seek out environmentally clean energy.

What remains very unclear is TNPC's true motivations and the future of
the company, which made such a big splash when it began operating last
spring. Is this a classic case of an energy start-up chasing down trends
(e.g., the current high value of renewable energy stocks) in order to=20
rejuvenate
itself, or a true identity transformation? The questions are pertinent
as long as TNPC continues to generate losses and its stock continues to
struggle.

EHS Corporate has asked we verify this inventory of services/products  from 
all of the various companies that fit under the very broadest form of the ETS 
umbrella.  I offer the following thoughts:  I don't believe EOTT has any 
relationship with the Mt. Belvieu storage operations; I don't know if we 
purchase natural gas except for fuel purposes; do we currently have any gas 
gathering facilities?? or just transmission??; EOTT Fleet Vehicles could be 
better defined; Risk Management services??

Feedback would be extremely helpful before the 17th

Lou,

This is a follow-up to a meeting we had about 2 months ago on Life Cycle 
Impact Assessments.  The 1st phase of the assessment involves completing an 
inventory of Enron's products\services and volumes.  I am currently 
requesting each business unit to verify the products and services we have 
identified and make any modifications to the list.  I am enlisting your 
assistance to do this for ETS, including EOTT.  I need to have the 
verification completed by 11/17. Please advise if you have any questions.



Thanks,

Subject: FW: Texas version of Survivor


We're told top aides at the Bush campaign headquarters in Austin were
in hysterics upon hearing that network television is developing a
Texas version of "Survivor," the popular TV show.

Contestants must travel from Amarillo through Fort Worth, Dallas,
Houston, San Antonio, and back to Amarillo, through San Marcos and
Lubbock, driving a Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads: "I'm for
Gore, I'm Gay and I'm Here to Take Your Guns."
If anybody finishes, they win.

Subject: Fossum news rocks Enron stock


I trust you guys saw this on the wires today:

Enron's stock was off $3-3/16 or 4.1 percent in afternoon trading at $74, 
following an announcement that Jeff Skilling will become its new chief 
executive officer on Feb. 12. An analyst, who asked not to be named, said 
that it had been widely assumed that Drew Fossum would be named CEO; 
therefore, the company's stock traded lower on the news.

At this mornings staff meeting, Stan asked about the status of TW options 
filing,  Shelley indicated that she felt it would be on the Nov 21 st 
agenda.  The 30 days to act is up on Nov. 16th, if the FERC hasn't done 
anything aren't the tariff sheets approved as filed?? If that answer is yes,  
isn't an order after that date required to meet the SS 5 requirements??   
Just thinking about the timing-  MK

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

This will follow up on my conversation with you in the elevator a few days 
ago about the above-referenced matter.  Given Eric's departure, I mentioned 
to you  the Unit wanted to be able to help out with the usual December 
outside counsel estimated bills if you needed us.  The lesson that I have 
learned in the past is that the sooner we let outside counsel know how much 
of December's actual time you want reflected (if any) versus how much 
estimated time you want reflected, the easier it is for the law firms to get 
that done.

We're standing by to help.

Britt

This will confirm our understanding that provided you clear any potential 
counterparty with the ETS Credit Department, it will not be necessary to get 
clearance for such counterparty from the Legal Department. As we discussed 
today, we will appreciate your continuing to include Legal on the notices of 
new potential counterparties.

Tony, I need your review and approval asap for the attached E.Dubuque 
delivery products that are "daily" in nature (one is for receipt at Ventura 
and the other is for receipt at Demarc).  The rate aspect is the same 
language as the one-part rates we have already used (designated as "R+C).  
This "Dly" designation means that the term is one day which will be rolled 
over day-to-day unless either party cancels the rollover.  The term language 
shown here is the same as the "daily" language we have been using.  Call me 
with your questions. Thanks. x7067.

Duke Energy Offers Fixed-Priced Electricity Package for SDG&E
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Duke Energy, through its business unit Duke Energy North America (DENA),
has submitted an offer to manage San Diego Gas & Electric's (SDG&E) 3,300-M=
W
electricity load. The offer would establish a fixed price of 6 cents per
kilowatt-hour for wholesale power supply for the next five years, based
on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov. 17, 2000. DENA'=
s
proposal, which takes into account SDG&E's seasonal and hourly load=20
requirements
and has a 3-percent annual adjustment for inflation, was included in commen=
ts
submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) last week
in response to the commission's proposed remedies for California's electric=
ity
market.

ANALYSIS: As has been well documented in this column and elsewhere, SDG&E
customers witnessed a staggering increase in the price of their electricity
last summer and into this fall, which resulted primarily from an ongoing
imbalance between supply and demand in the state of California. In addition=
,
other contributory factors have included the state's economic growth, lack
of new power plants over the last decade, unstable existing generation,
and the uncertainty of import prospects.

As SDG&E's rate freeze had been lifted last spring, customers of the utilit=
y
were exposed to retail electricity prices that often exceeded 18 cents
per kilowatt-hour, compared to the 6.5 cent per kilowatt hour maximum they
had become accustomed to under the rate freeze. The problem persists as
all three utilities in the state face high wholesale electricity prices.
However, SDG&E customers are as of yet the only ones in the state who bear
the brunt of the high prices as a rate freeze remains in effect for=20
California's
other two IOUs, SCE and PG&E.

DENA is proposing to FERC that it be granted the right to provide power
for the totality of SDG&E's 3,300 MW electricity load. In return, DENA's
proposed fixed rate of 6 cents per kilowatt hour (plus annual 3-percent
increases) presumably will be much lower than the cost SDG&E customers
will continue to face without such a contract. DENA's proposal has been
made possible as a result of FERC's proposed order that was issued last
month, outlining a major overhaul of California's energy market. Since
competition began in the state in the spring of 1998, the three California
IOUs were required to buy their power from the state's Power Exchange.
FERC's order proposes to eliminate the requirement of buying from the PX,
which essentially permits the three IOUs to establish bilateral contracts
with energy suppliers. DENA has seized upon this opportunity to gain a
very lucrative contract, while at the same time attempting to protect SDG&E
customers from exorbitant electricity prices.

So, what is SDG&E's response to DENA's proposal? I spoke with Doug Kline,
spokesperson for the utility, yesterday afternoon. Kline pointed out that,
first of all, SDG&E has not yet received any offer from DENA and that "all
we've seen thus far is a press release." Kline suggested that it was a
public relations strategy on the part of DENA to first submit its proposal
to FERC and that, ultimately, SDG&E would be the one to accept DENA's offer=
.
In order to speak in detail on DENA's proposal, Kline said he would need
to see an actual contract, which has yet to materialize. Kline did disclose
that locking up long-term contracts for SDG&E customers, based on today's
high prices, would have to be seriously questioned by the utility, especial=
ly
considering that new generation will be coming online in California over
the next few years.

Beyond that, SDG&E is fielding other offers from energy suppliers, and
in fact has established long-term contracts with other providers, which
remain unidentified, for 50 percent of the power it buys on the wholesale
market. Back in September, the CPUC granted approval for SDG&E (as well
as SCE and PG&E) to purchase 50 percent of its power in forward markets,
with the other 50 percent still coming from the PX. For SDG&E, this amounts
to 1,900 MW of its total electricity load. Kline said that SDG&E would
need to compare DENA's offer with those received or accepted from other
energy suppliers to know if it represents a good deal for SDG&E customers.


At the same time, Sempra Energy=01*SDG&E's parent company=01*has made its o=
wn
proposal to FERC, urging the federal regulators to order refunds for SDG&E
customers and place a rate cap on wholesale rates, based on generators'
actual fees. Under FERC's proposed order, the commission suggested a "soft
rate cap" of $150/MWh. It's referred to
as "soft" because sellers may bid above this level and receive their bid
if they are dispatched, but anything higher than $150/MWh will not set
the price that all generators will receive. Also, any generator setting
a bid above the soft rate cap must report their bid to the Commission,
and presumably fall under intense scrutiny.

This is not the first attempt that DENA has made to, as it says, "fix the
crisis" in California. In fact, back in August DENA offered California
Governor Gray Davis a deal in which the company would deliver 3,000 MW
of new supply to the state through the construction of generation facilitie=
s,
and provide all three IOUs with five-year, fixed-priced supply contracts.
Although Gov. Davis did not finalize a deal that would apply to all three
IOUs, SCE and PG&E proceeded with their own wholesale electricity contracts
with DENA. Both deals were sealed within the last month, although the speci=
fic
prices of the contracts are proprietary.

DENA has also proceeded with building new generation in the state. Just
two weeks ago, the company broke ground on a $525 million modernization
of its Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County. The modernization effor=
t
is projected to add 1,060 MW of new capacity to site's current 1,500 MW
and create the state's largest power plant. DENA claims that, when complete=
d,
the 2,560 MW that the plant will produce will generate enough wholesale
electricity to serve approximately 2.5 million households. In addition,
DENA has pending applications with the California Energy Commission to
modernize and expand two other power plants in California (Morro Bay and
South Bay power plants).

DENA's motivations are pretty understandable. The company may espouse good
intentions of helping California recover from its crisis but, realistically=
,
energy suppliers stand to make an awful lot of money from the state. I
started to notice the trend last month as 3Q earnings were reported. Virtua=
lly
every company that is active in California's wholesale market reported
a significant increase in earnings, reflective of the summer price volatili=
ty.
DENA was no exception. As a whole, Duke Energy reported record 3Q earnings
of $2.08 per share, a 73-percent increase over earnings per share of $1.20
for 3Q 1999. The company's North American Wholesale Energy=01*comprised of
DENA and Duke Energy Merchants=01*posted sharply higher gains with EBIT of
$231 million, a 175-percent increase over 3Q 1999. According to Duke Energy=
's
report, DENA achieved strong performance from its fleet of merchant power
plants and from natural gas and power trading activities.  DENA remains
on schedule to deliver approximately 3,200 megawatts of new merchant=20
generation
(nationally) in time for summer 2001.

Moreover, it is as of yet unknown whether or not DENA's offer truly benefit=
s
SDG&E and its customers. The proposal certainly benefits DENA, however,
especially if the company can lock in a contract that is based on current
high prices and includes annual increases. Securing SDG&E customers under
these factors would be a major coup for DENA in the California market,
but how it stacks up against SDG&E's other unnamed offers remains to be
seen.

After a tumultuous Election Day full of constant changes in the projections=
,
the identity of the next president of the United States was still unknown
as of Wednesday morning, Nov. 8. The identity of the next U.S. president
will be determined by a vote recount in Florida, which must be completed
by the close of business Thursday, state election officials said. Tuesday's
national vote count is so close, as is the number of electoral votes won
by GOP candidate George W. Bush and Democrat Vice President Al Gore, that
the presidential election is too close to call. It is also possible that
one candidate could win the Electoral College vote and the other win the
popular vote, which hasn't happened in a hundred years.

ANALYSIS: Well, it certainly has been a history-making Election Day. I
was prepared to analyze the future of the energy industry, based on which
presidential candidate had been elected yesterday. As the candidates have
such polarized platforms with regard to energy issues, it is not an=20
overestimation
to say that many critical energy issues hinge on this election. As we await
the final (and accurate) announcement of who is the next U.S. president,
which may not come for another day or so, it is a good time to review how
each candidate intends to address low domestic supplies of oil and natural
gas, the status of deregulation, the development of renewable energy, and
the high cost of energy due to recent price spikes.

Throughout the campaign, Bush criticized the Clinton-Gore Administration
for not developing a comprehensive energy policy. Rather than developing
an effective energy policy, Bush accused Gore of raising gasoline taxes,
discouraging domestic production of oil and natural gas, and failing to
anticipate the oil and natural-gas price spikes that have occurred this
year. Bush also was very critical of President Clinton's decision to tap
into the Strategic Reserve Fund in September and release 30 million barrels
of crude oil from the nation's emergency oil stockpile.  As the United
States now enters a so-called "energy crisis," brought about primarily
as a result of rising demand and diminishing supplies, Bush has outlined
an energy policy that includes more than 20 initiatives. I can't address
all of them, but have identified the key policies that will likely unfold
under a Bush administration. Perhaps the best summary of Bush's energy
policy is that he supports a comprehensive approach to ensuring U.S. energy
security, and intends to accomplish this by expanding domestic resources,
using a range of fuels and technologies, supporting ongoing deregulation
of the industry, and providing energy assistance to low-income households.


Reduce American dependence on foreign supplies of oil. Bush repeatedly
made the case that, since 1960, U.S. energy demand has more than doubled,
far outstripping domestic production. Today, the United States consumes
approximately one-third of the world's energy, and approximately 28 percent
of our usage comes from foreign sources. Bush contends that U.S. dependence
on foreign oil has increased from 50 percent in 1993 to 56 percent today,
and that oil imports are projected to increase to 15 million barrels per
day by 2010. To remedy this, Bush supports the development of domestic
sources for oil, natural gas and renewable energy. Specifically, Bush has
proposed opening 8 percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to=20
"environmentally
responsible and regulated exploration," with the intent of replacing the
oil that the United States now imports from Iraq. Regarding natural gas,
Bush will examine whether certain promising natural-gas reserves in federal
lands should be opened for exploration. Yet, it's important to note that
Bush is not suggesting that domestic supply of oil and natural gas will
be sufficient. Rather, he recognizes that access to an adequate supply
of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to the United States
and the global economy. However, instead of relying predominantly on Iraq=

with Canada and Mexico to increase cross-border flows of oil, natural gas
and electricity within North America.

Support new pipeline construction. As domestic production of oil and natura=
l
gas increases to meet growing demand, Bush also supports the construction
of new pipelines, and would expand refining capacity by tearing down=20
"regulatory
hurdles." Bush has referenced the National Petroleum Council's estimates
that the gas industry will require 38,000 miles of new transmission pipelin=
es
and 255,000 miles of distribution lines by 2015. Bush sees a need for new
pipelines and distribution lines in the Midwest in particular, where=20
traditional
coal plants should ultimately be replaced by gas-fired plants.

Support the growth of renewable energy. Bush supports the development of
renewable and low-emission fuels, and has committed to investing $2 billion
over 10 years to fund "clean-coal technologies" and $1 billion over 10
years to help utilities purchase nuclear plants. At the same time, Bush
will propose legislation requiring utilities to reduce harmful emissions
from their generation plants, and offer tax credits for power produced
from alternative or renewable fuels. However, Bush recognizes that while
renewable energy is important, it currently accounts for less than 4 percen=
t
of the total U.S. energy consumption. Consequently, for the foreseeable
future, Bush contends that hydrocarbons=01*oil, coal and natural gas=01*wil=
l
continue to play the primary role in meeting the growing energy needs of
Americans.

Support electric deregulation. Bush supports deregulation of the energy
industry and prefers to let "markets, and not government officials=01*deter=
mine
investment decisions" and "give customers a choice of suppliers." Toward
this end, Bush believes that federal restructuring legislation is needed
to "assure the reliability of the nation's electrical grid, and to promote
consumer choice by removing federal barriers to competition." While he
supports consumer choice, Bush recognizes that often low-income families
face high electricity prices (as was found in San Diego this summer).=20
Consequently,
Bush supports the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the
largest direct expenditure energy subsidy program, which has about $155
million left in funding to support emergency funding for cooling and heatin=
g
assistance. In addition, Bush will expand the Weatherization Assistance
Program, which supports about 76,900 homes by spending $1.4 billion for
Weatherization programs over the next ten years.

As noted, the presidential candidates are proposing very different platform=
s
with regard to the energy industry. Thus, it is not surprising that Vice
President Gore disagrees with most everything that Governor Bush is proposi=
ng.
Essentially the most striking difference comes down to conservation. While
Bush supports the exploration of domestic fuels, Gore believes the United
States should focus on doing more with what we already have, and protecting
the environment for future generations.

Of course, Gore carries the legacy of his Clinton-Gore administration,
one that as noted has been criticized by Bush for not developing a=20
comprehensive
energy policy. Thus, it is not completely clear how Gore would depart from
what has been his administration's approach to energy issues over the last
seven years. It is likely that Gore's administration would follow much
the same path that the Clinton administration traveled, although Gore=20
certainly
has made the environment one of his core platforms (for example, his 1993
book, Earth in the Balance). Thus, is not surprising that "creating a clean
environment and stable climate" is one of the key foundations on which
Gore has established his energy platform.

Beyond that, Gore has said that his "new" energy policy will focus on five
goals: 1). Saving energy, reducing pollution, promoting a higher standard
of living and creating high-wage jobs. 2). Reducing the nation's dependence
on unreliable imported oil. 3). Protecting children against the threat
of pollution nationally and globally. 4). Dramatically reducing the threat
posed by global warming. 5). Curtailing brownouts by increasing the=20
reliability
of the power grid.

Perhaps the central initiative that Gore has proposed is the creation of
the National Energy Security and Environmental Trust Fund. Designed to
"bring revolutionary change to our transportation and energy infrastructure=
,"
the Fund would help consumers purchase energy-efficient vehicles, homes
and appliances, promote clean and reliable sources of electric power, and
encourage long-term solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on imported sources
of oil. Gore would provide consumers with a tax credit up to $2,000 to
purchase energy-efficient new homes or up to a $1,000 credit to upgrade
the efficiency of their current homes. Gore also supports expanding the
current 10-percent tax credit provided to homes or businesses that use
solar energy to generate electricity or heat water.

Gore opposes drilling in federal land, and instead aims to protect the
U.S. environment, increase reliance on low-pollution fuels and focus on
energy-efficiency / lower consumption programs. Articulating the Democratic
position on this issue, Senator Joe Lieberman made the following comments
in the vice presidential debate: "There are more resources within the Unite=
d
States. If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars, we'll
get a million=01*we'll save a million barrels of oil a day, which is exactl=
y
what the refuge, at its best, in Alaska, would produce=01(We've got to deve=
lop
fuel cells, alternative energy. We've got to encourage people to conserve..=
."
Gore supports tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fund, as Preside=
nt
Clinton did in September, to increase oil supplies, prevent winter shortage=
s
of home heating oil and stabilize oil prices.

Perhaps the only issue on which the two candidates agree is deregulation
of the energy industry as a whole. This process is of course occurring
on a state-by-state basis, although many states have begun to resist=20
competition
due to current low prices in their states and fear of sudden price spikes
as occurred in California this summer. Bush clearly supports a national
restructuring law, while it unclear if Gore supports this as well, or prefe=
rs
to let states continue to deregulate on their own or opt out from this
process.

One thing is clear in all of this uncertainty. The future of the energy
industry hangs in the balance and will continue in one of two drastically
different directions as the final outcome of this election is determined.
As supply and demand issues continue to generate concern across the country=
,
it is certain that energy issues will remain on the radar of whichever
candidate is elected president.

Rich,
Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our 
next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to 
operate their Griffith system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need 
to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be 
necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting 
word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Note:  This is significant for the total energy picture in Wisconsin.  While 
this plant is on ANR's system, we could see continued problems throughout the 
winter for the electric generation in Wisc.

News Releases 

Alliant Energy's WP&L Experiences Winter Power Supply "Close Call" 

MADISON- Dec. 12, 2000- Wisconsin Power and Light Co. (WP&L), Alliant 
Energy's Wisconsin utility subsidiary, experienced a power supply "close 
call" Monday evening. The company appealed to customers for voluntary 
conservation measures and exercised its interruptible customer contracts to 
maintain system reliability.

"While we have heard regular reports of this type of situation occurring over 
the past few days in California, this is the first time we have appealed to 
customers for emergency conservation measures in the winter," says Bill 
Harvey, president, Alliant Energy - WP&L. Harvey says the lack of electric 
generation supply in Wisconsin coupled with limited transmission import 
capabilities continues to put Wisconsin's power supply at risk. "There is 
very little cushion available, which makes dealing with emergencies like we 
had last night very challenging, and potentially very dangerous," says Harvey.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. last night, 300 megawatts of generation supply 
went off-line at WP&L's South Fond du Lac plant due to a fuel intake problem. 
The loss of this generation represented approximately 12.5% of WP&L's total 
Wisconsin generation capacity. High electric demand within the state and a 
constrained transmission system made obtaining replacement power virtually 
impossible. WP&L declared a system emergency, exercised its interruptible 
contracts and appealed to the public for voluntary conservation. The 
emergency status resulted in freeing up transmission capacity. WP&L was then 
able to bring on-line additional peaking capacity and obtain power from 
outside the state. Customer conservation efforts also played an important 
role in avoiding more serious power supply consequences.

"Thanks to our customers who conserved electricity last night and the hard 
work from our power supply team overnight, we are back to normal this 
morning," says Harvey. Harvey notes that winter power supply problems are 
rare, but are potentially much more serious and difficult to manage than 
summer problems. The circumstances surrounding last night's problems were 
particularly challenging. "The snow storm caused many businesses to shut down 
early, so we knew there was not going to be a great deal of power to be saved 
by exercising our interruptible contracts," says Harvey. "We appreciate the 
conservation efforts of our customers last night who turned off holiday 
decorative lights, delayed laundry and running their dishwasher."

WP&L and other Wisconsin utilities keep a percentage of their total 
generation, called spinning reserve, operating beyond what is required to 
meet current demand to deal with potential emergencies. With the loss of the 
300 megawatts of generation from the South Fond du Lac plant last night, 
WP&L's spinning reserves dropped below safe levels, prompting the emergency 
actions. "Issuing a public appeal and exercising our interruptible contracts, 
while unusual, was a prudent and conservative course of action given the 
weather conditions," says Harvey. The fuel intake problem at the South Fond 
du Lac plant has been resolved and WP&L's system has returned to normal 
operations today.

Over the last several days, the one transmission line connecting Wisconsin to 
power supplies in the west has been operating a maximum capacity, providing 
little or no ability to import additional power into the state. Local 
opposition to additional natural gas-fired and wind powered generation has 
delayed the construction of new in-state power sources. Harvey says the lack 
of new infrastructure results in a very troubling situation.

"The consequences of rotating blackouts in the winter are very serious, 
particularly with weather as harsh as we are currently experiencing," says 
Harvey. "Last night presented yet another clear indication of why Wisconsin 
needs to move forward, and do so quickly, to ensure the construction of 
needed additional electric infrastructure."

25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

An overview of NERC's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009
      ,Copyright 2000 EEI. All rights reserved.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum 
providing an overview of the North American Electric Reliability Council's 
(NERC) recently released Reliability Assessment 2000-2009, the reliability of 
bulk electric systems in North America.

The reliability of the electric generation and transmission systems serving 
North America has come under increased federal government, state regulator, 
and customer scrutiny. Generation capacity margins have decreased and the 
bulk electric systems are subjected to flows in magnitudes and directions not 
contemplated when they were designed or for which there is minimal operating 
experience.

Each year, the Reliability Assessment Subcommittee (RAS) of the North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reviews the overall reliability 
of existing and planned electric generation and transmission systems in North 
America. This year's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 report presents:

*An assessment of electric generation and transmission reliability through 
2009

*An assessment of the generation resource adequacy of each Interconnection in 
North America

*A discussion of key issues affecting reliability of future electric supply

*Regional assessments of electric supply reliability, including issues of 
specific Regional concern

Presenting an overview of this year's Reliability Assessment is Frank J. 
Koza, Jr., Chairman, Reliability Assessment Subcommittee, and General 
Manager, Ventures, PECO Energy Company.

Our guest moderator is Tim Gallagher, Mgr Technical Services, NERC

To provide questions and commentary we have Jolly Hayden, Vice President of 
Transmission, Dynegy

A copy of the Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 is available from the NERC web 
site at http://www.nerc.com/~pc/syscond.html.

November 21, 2000 1 p.m. ET
Note: Please block a 2-hour time slot for the E-Forum. We expect the program 
to take about one hour. Q&A at the conclusion of the E-Forum could take up to 
an additional hour.

Allegheny Expands Growing Generation Portfolio with Solar Energy
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Allegheny Energy Solutions, an unregulated subsidiary of Allegheny Energy,
Inc., has added Siemens Solar Industries, L.P., to its growing portfolio
of suppliers for distributed generation products. Through its new agreement
with Siemens Solar Industries, Allegheny Energy Solutions will provide
its customers with a comprehensive offering of solar electric solutions
called earthsafe =01v. The systems are suited for industrial, commercial an=
d
residential applications. The new partnership further advances Allegheny's
strategy of becoming a national energy supplier.

ANALYSIS: This partnership comes on the heels of Allegheny's recently=20
announced
agreement to purchase three gas-fired merchant plants from Enron North
America. Both deals reaffirm Allegheny's intent to expand its geographic
footprint and strengthen the scope of its unregulated generation capability=
.
In my opinion, Allegheny is one of a handful of companies that have further=
ed
very aggressive generation expansion plans this year, announcing one=20
acquisition
or development after another. The company has added seven new offices in
the northeastern United States over the last year, and has disclosed that
it will open new offices in the Southeast in 2001 to begin preparing for
the albeit slow move to competition in that region.

The partnership with Siemens is particularly interesting as it indicates
that Allegheny believes solar power will become a significant part of its
service offerings. Siemens Solar is one competitive business in Siemens'
portfolio of companies, specializing in high and medium voltage, protection
and substation control systems, power and distribution transformers, system
planning, and decentralized energy supply systems.  Siemens Solar claims
to be the number one provider of solar-power solutions in the world, having
shipped solar cells and modules with a cumulative peak power of 200 MW.
The company has been in business for about 20 years, and reached a mileston=
e
of 100 MW in 1996. Thus, the company has doubled its production output
in just four years.

Siemens Solar offers an array of solar-related products. As noted, Alleghen=
y
Energy Solutions will be adopting Siemen's earthsafe platform which, accord=
ing
to information on Siemen's Website, is offered in four models ranging in
DC power from 300 watts to 1,200 watts. The earthsafe system consists of
solar modules, universal roof mounting kits, DC/AC inverters, and interconn=
ect
hardware. The intent is that businesses and residences would install the
earthsafe system to supply a portion of their energy needs (the remainder
supplied by more traditional means) and contribute to the efforts of reduci=
ng
emissions from fossil fuel plants. Allegheny Energy Solutions claims that
the addition of the Siemens' product to its service offerings positions
it as one of the only suppliers of distributed generation products to offer
a complete on-site power solution.

I think that this is a smart move for Allegheny to take as it certainly
diversifies the company's service offerings. Although the jury is still
out regarding the profitability of solar power, along with other forms
of distributed and renewable energy sources, for Allegheny the move makes
sense as it attempts to offer on a national scale a full package of energy
solutions. Allegheny Energy Supply, where most of the generation expansion
efforts of its parent are focused, develops competitive generation solution=
s
(e.g., cogeneration, green power, etc.) for a variety of end users. Within
the last year, Allegheny Energy Solutions has made great strides in moving
from a regional player into a national energy supplier, resulting primarily
from its success in the strong Northeast market.

This venture into solar continues a decided focus on distributed generation
on the part of the unregulated company. Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy
Solutions formed a partnership with Capstone Turbine Corporation under
which the Capstone MicroTurbine was installed at Allegheny Energy's Mitchel=
l
Power Station in New Eagle, Pa. Allegheny Energy Solutions is providing
technical and economic analysis of the unit for the customers of its parent
company. This was a very strategic partnership for Allegheny as it makes
the company one of the few system integrators of the Capstone MicroTurbine
in the Northeast.

The diversification of Allegheny's generation arsenal is also important
because it gives the company a possible edge over direct competitors.=20
Allegheny
must surely know that companies like Dominion, Reliant and AES=01*just to
name a few=01*are also aggressively stacking up generation assets in key ar=
eas
across the country. Thus, by adding diverse power options to its service
offerings, Allegheny conceivably will have more to offer customers in its
energy supply packages. I observed several months ago that Allegheny was
probably in search of a unique niche to set itself apart from other compani=
es
that are strong in generation. This partnership with Siemens seems to indic=
ate
that distributed generation, including solar power, could become that niche=
.

As a sidenote, Allegheny Energy was just added to Standard & Poor's 500
Index earlier this week. So, the announcement that the company is diversify=
ing
into solar power comes at a time when, as CEO Alan Noia puts it, "our stron=
g
growth strategy and resulting solid financial performance" have received
recognition. The S&P 500 Index is widely regarded as the standard for=20
measuring
large-capitalization U.S. stock market performance. As of yesterday (Dec.
7), Allegheny Energy's stock (NYSE: AYE) was priced at $42 5/16.

The only red flag that I can determine for this deal relates to Siemens,
not Allegheny Energy Solutions. Competition among companies that develop
products related to solar power has become pretty fierce as of late, and
there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the profitability
of this market. One direct competitor to Siemens that I've tracked recently
is Evergreen Solar, a company whose String Ribbon technology reportedly
cuts in half the required use of silicon, which is needed for most solar-po=
wer
technologies. Evergreen Solar, which recently became a publicly traded
company, has acknowledged that its own market prospects are uncertain and
that it may never become a profitable company.

The same market conditions apply to Siemens Solar Industries, so the compan=
y
may have a difficult time in finding wide application for its solar power
units. This is, of course, an issue for Siemens, and not Allegheny, to
address. Under its partnership with Siemens, Allegheny attains all the
value of solar power technologies and little of the risks. Thus, this appea=
rs
to be a smart venture for Allegheny and one that should strongly benefit
its power supply opportunities.

E-mail / Voice Mail Retention Policy Change Notice

We have just received notice of a change to the e-mail and voice mail=20
retention policy.  The change will go into effect Friday, December 15, 2000=
.

The greatest impact will be to your "sent mail," which will be retained onl=
y=20
30 days as compared to the current 365 days. =20

As a reminder, you should not use the email system to store important=20
documents.
They should be saved to your network directory which is regularly backed up=
.

However, for 'sent' messages you want to keep longer than 30 days in the=20
email system, you should move the messages from the Sent Mail to a specific=
=20
folder where the messages can be kept 365 days.

The scope of the e-mail retention policy includes all forms of electronic=
=20
mail, for example, Lotus Notes Mail, Internet e-mail, Outlook e-mail, and=
=20
voice mail.

Enron supports a work environment in which information is freely exchanged=
=20
and encourages employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf of Enro=
n=20
to use its computers and related electronic resources in accomplishing thei=
r=20
work.  Computers, systems, and networks and the work products they contain=
=20
are Enron property and subject to Enron review and control.  All Enron=20
employees, contractors, and agents are responsible for using the computing=
=20
resources provided to them by Enron in an appropriate manner.

The revised retention schedule follows:

Message Location    Maximum Retention
Inbox     30 Days
Message Log/Sent Mail   30 Days
Trash     Rollover from Inbox for 15 days
Bulletin Boards    30 Days
Folders/Archives    E-mails placed in Folders or Archives =01) one year
Voice mail     90 days

The Corp IT Group responsible for maintaining compliance with this=20
e-mail/voice mail policy will automatically purge e-mail and voice mail old=
er=20
than the allowed maximum retention age.  Any exception to this policy=20
requires approval from Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders.

If you need assistance in creating folders and saving documents to them,=20
please call the Helpdesk x7454.  We will be glad to assist you.

Attached are my notes from the session with the Alliance for Energy suppliers 
held today at Reliant's offices.  You'll see from the notes that this effort 
isn't going anywhere fast.  Nonetheless, I thought you would be interested in 
the market intelligence of how other pipelines, particularly Tennessee, are 
dealing with the generators.

Is Grounding a Substitute for Surge Suppression Protection?

One of the most common questions regarding Surge Suppression is whether it
is necessary when a grounding system exists. Proper grounding is necessary
for the Instrumentation and Automation systems in use today, but is no
substitute for Surge Suppression equipment in preventing electrical system
damage. Grounding should only be part of the strategy in preventing
equipment damage from electrical surges.

An electrical surge is a burst of voltage that lasts only a matter of
microseconds but which generates very large amounts of current, and this
current must be diverted away from the electrical equipment to be protected.
Some people hold the opinion that if a grounding system is installed, the
electrical system voltage will rise together and lower together and that no
damage to the equipment will occur. While this could be true in theory, the
reality is that very few installations are isolated from other voltages. For
example, the addition of computers with modems or network cards introduces
another ground into the system.

If the two buildings are separated electrically, then the possibility of
damage is minimized, but it is more likely that modems or data lines
interconnect the buildings. A typical scenario might be:

 A lightning strike in the vicinity of one building increases the
 ground potential to 200KV.

 The resistance of the ground decreases this voltage to 15KV
 by the time it gets to the ground circuit of that building.

 As the voltage decreases over the distance to the adjacent
 building, it has lowered to 3KV, with a resulting difference
 of 12KV.

In such a case, the voltage difference between the two buildings generates a
surge current large enough to destroy the communication lines between the
two buildings, and no grounding system can prevent the damage to the
communication ports of the computers. Similarly, any instruments mounted
outdoors can have the same type of voltage difference from the control panel
to which they are connected.

Therefore, while good grounding is essential, it will not neutralize the
potential damage to equipment and processes caused by a surge event.

I think it is important to get estimates from the litigation group and from 
outside counsel on major matters. I am not going to lose any sleep if we dont 
get something on the Grynberg/Quinque cases from outside counsel because 
frankly there has not been a lot of activity and our fractional share of 
joint bills for matters would be relatively small.

Mike, Louis, and Drew,

This follows up on my e-mails to you and my conversations with Mike about 
this subject.  We want to make sure that you are not caught in a year-end 
problem if you want to get the usual December estimates for Unit bills.  
Unfortunately, as Becky indicates, if we do not receive your instructions 
regarding this by December 12 at the very latest, then it will be too late 
for us to do what you want.

I assume that if you want December estimates, you will also want them from 
outside counsel.  Last year, it took a good deal of time to get those 
estimates from the attorneys representing your (and other Enron entities') 
interests in the Grynberg/Quinque cases.  I have received no instructions 
from you with regard to these or any other outside counsel. 

We greatly value our representation of the GPG and want to help in any way we 
can.  Please let us know what we can do.

Britt

Britt, I am finalizing the Unit billing schedule for December and I need some 
information.  We will be sending out the bills for the November time on 
December 14th.  After that, we will issue another billing for December 1 - 14 
time.  Those bills will go out the last week of December.  If the GPG wants 
to have estimates for the remainder of December time, then we need to know 
that by December 12th, at the very latest.  Please let me know their wishes 
as soon as you find out.  Thanks, Becky

Late Wednesday, FERC issued a notice of staff conference discussing issues 
pertinent to Order No. 637.  This is the second of three public conferences 
to be held on January 31 at 1:00 p.m. to be held at FERC's offices. Panel 
Participants will be debating issues concerning the market consequences of 
transactions between pipelines and affiliates.  Since parties will not be 
making an oral presentation, it is requested that written comments be 
submitted to FERC by January 5, 2001 to 1) provide input on how to structure 
the discussion; 2) identify issues and examples to foster a meaningful 
dialog; and 3) suggest questions the staff moderator may wish to pose to the 
panel.  Attached is the Notice.

Susan, you asked about Texas during our telephone conversation.  I should 
mention that Texas has a statute that prohibits demanding or selling at an 
excessive price such things as fuel, food and medicine if the Governor has 
declared a disaster, which I assumed didn't fit our scenario.  I didn't see 
anything in the Texas case law but it was a quick look.

Tony Pryor recommended that I put back into the policy section II A &B so 
that at our meeting tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. we can discuss them.  Please use 
this copy of the draft dated 12/5/00 to discuss from tomorrow.

Subject: ETS risk management policy revisions

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Dan

Yesterday, Fred Ni from the FERC called with some questions regarding the TW 
options filing.  Most all of his questions centered around the determination 
of the highest value.  
 Bottom of page 7, last paragragh, we say Shipper call options will be 
awarded upon the highest rate payable for the  option component.
 Then in the bullets that follow we say, based on the criteria known in 
advance-  I told him that we would post the   elements and it would determine 
the highest value.
 Then in the next paragraph we say again sold in a bidding process to only 
those parties that place the highest value  on the option.
 Then on the actual tariff sheet, 98 we refer to in  33 c) method of awarding 
options, ?? being is the highest value
 Then on tariff sheet 157, in the Option Fee section he felt we should refer 
to the elements that make up the highest   value; volume , rate and term
As you can tell, this all centers around the elements of determining the 
highest bid,  I advised him that it included rate, volume and term that the 
option call was for.   We need to clarify these in writing as soon as 
possible.  I told him we would do so in our answer to interventions.  He said 
the sooner the better.  We also need to add expriation date on tariff sheet 
98 c as to items included in the posting, since it could be different than 
the exercise date.  

I'd say all in all this is good that this is his only concern and that he 
called before any protests etc.  He said he like the filing-  but was just 
confused on what we meant by awarding to the highest value.  

Susan, I assume you will be drafting the answer, although at this point I 
haven't seen any protests, let's try to have the answer filed Friday or 
Monday at the latest.    Please call if questions-  MK

Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom 
of this synopsis, the web site address  will 
direct you to the full report released today if you would like further 
information.

EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term

A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural 
gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year 
in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from 
$2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's 
latest report. 

EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. 
economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up 
from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost 
overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 
2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 
2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for 
about half the change in energy projections. 

EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 
2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During 
the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural 
gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. 
"In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and 
production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases 
even as demand for these fuels grows." 

EIA projects world oil prices will reach $22.41/barrel (in 1999 dollars) in 
2020, up just slightly from the $22.04 in last year's forecast. 

The federal bean counters see a 1.8% average annual increase in power demand 
over the next 20 years, compared to the 1.3% they predicted last year. Prices 
will decline from the current 6.7 cents per kWh, but not as much as predicted 
last year due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of 5.8 cents per 
kWh in 2020, EIA's AEO2001 sees electric rates holding at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

Power to be provided by nuclear generation jumped 34% from the forecast last 
year "due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear 
plants and higher projected natural gas prices, although total nuclear 
generation still declines as some existing plants retire." 

Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will 
dwindle from 51% to 44% of the generating total.

Duke, Williams to Buy Gulfstream from Coastal Corporation
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their intent to jointly
purchase The Coastal Corporation's 100-percent interest in the Gulfstream
Natural Gas System project. The purchase, expected to be finalized by the
end of this year, is subject to federal regulatory approvals and conditione=
d
upon completion of the Coastal / El Paso Energy Corporation merger. Financi=
al
terms of the purchase were not disclosed.

ANALYSIS: The Gulfstream project is a proposed 744-mile steel pipeline
designed specifically to deliver natural gas into Florida. The project
has been sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp., a $16 billion=20
Houston-based
energy holding company with operations in natural-gas production, distribut=
ion
and marketing. Coastal Corp. is presently waiting for FERC's approval to
build and operate the system. However, due to regulatory mandates related
to Coastal Corp.'s pending merger with El Paso Energy Corp., Coastal Corp.
was forced by the Federal Trade Commission to divest the project. As a
result, Duke Energy and Williams have found a good window of opportunity
to purchase the pipeline project and its valuable inroad to the Florida
market. Until the merger is complete, Coastal Corp. will continue to develo=
p
and market Gulfstream.

According to Coastal, the $1.6 billion Gulfstream project has already achie=
ved
two important milestones in its FERC approval process: preliminary=20
determination
on non-environmental issues and a favorable draft environmental impact
statement. The company anticipates that the project will receive full FERC
approval in the first quarter 2001 and that Gulfstream will become fully
operational in June 2002. Approximately 400 miles of the route, which=20
originates
in Mobile, Ala., crosses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal
offshore waters. Gulfstream offers 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural-gas
capacity per day, and is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities
and power-generation facilities that plan on using high-efficiency natural-=
gas
turbines. Already, the project has precedent agreements with 10 large Flori=
da
utilities and power generation facilities.

Upon completion of the purchase, Duke and Williams will proceed with the
jointly managed operation and development of the Gulfstream project. It's
not difficult to assess why Duke and Williams would be interested in making
the acquisition. The two companies, which have historically had a=20
collaborative
relationship, already own significant amounts of interstate natural-gas
pipeline capacity. Between its two subsidiaries involved in natural-gas
production=01*Duke Energy Field Services and Duke Energy Gas Transmission=
=01*Duke
Energy owns and operates about 57,000 miles of pipeline and 12,000 intersta=
te
miles of capacity. Williams' five interstate natural gas pipelines reported=
ly
deliver about 16 percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States.
The company's vast 27,300-mile pipeline network stretches from coast to
coast and from Mexico to Canada, serving more than 48 million residential,
commercial and industrial natural gas users. In fact, the two companies
already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeline project in Florida, a
674-mile pipeline that would have followed a similar route as the Gulfstrea=
m
project will follow. Duke and Williams are no longer planning the Buccaneer
project now that they are acquiring the Gulfstream project. The addition
of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and offer a prime position
for them to expand their independent operations in Florida.

The CEO of Williams' gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market
would support only one new pipeline coming into the state. By joining=20
together,
Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the high-growth state as it=20
eventually
becomes competitive. First among the priorities for the project is to ensur=
e
adequate pipeline capacity by June 2002, and meeting the projected 10,000
MW electric generation growth that is expected by 2007.

Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project
accelerates its own entry into Florida. In fact, Richard Priory, Duke's
CEO, conceded at a conference last September that much of Duke's future
success will result from its natural-gas operations. Specifically, Duke
has been focused on merchant plant and natural-gas pipeline construction
for some time. As of this summer, Duke was rated third in announced merchan=
t
plants (behind Calpine and Panda), and has made no bones about the fact
that its strategy is centered around building additional merchant plants
and acquiring natural-gas pipelines. Thus, the acquisition of Gulfstream
is a perfectly appropriate move for the company to make.

And the strategy is resulting in some significant payoffs for the company.
Duke's third-quarter earnings rose 75 percent. Duke attributed the higher
results to the continued expansion of its unregulated energy businesses,
specifically natural-gas gathering and foreign energy sales. Duke's shares,
which had been trading at 52-week peaks, are currently trading at $88 15/16
(as of the opening of the market on Nov. 20). Current market conditions
certainly validate Duke's growth in this direction. For starters, current
data indicate that natural gas is the fuel of choice for approximately
90 percent of all new electric generation that is being built. Most=20
projections
place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new generation as the
demand for natural gas is expected to increase from 23 trillion to 30 trill=
ion
cubic feet per year by 2010. In addition, coal and nuclear generation came
under environmental and public scrutiny over the last two decades, at a
time when natural-gas prices were comparatively low. All of these factors
have created a strong market for natural-gas generation, despite the fact
that data from the Department of Energy suggests a shortage of natural
gas and heating oil for this winter.

Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market, so
this purchase could facilitate easier expansion in the state. About a year
ago, the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction
of a Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach. However, the state's three
IOUs appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that merch=
ant
plants were not allowed under state law. The Florida Supreme Court overturn=
ed
the decision of the state PSC, blocking Duke's entry into the state.=20
Consequently,
Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as another
way to get into the Florida market (and one that is potentially more=20
profitable).


Florida has not yet passed restructuring legislation, and it is unclear
when the state will become competitive. Bills have been introduced into
the state legislature, but thorny issues such as stranded cost recovery
and unbundling charges have caused the bills to be removed. Presently,
Governor Jeb Bush has created a 19-member commission to develop an energy
plan for the state. The commission must submit a report to the governor
and the legislature by December 1, 2001. Among the issues that must be
addressed are power reliability, energy supply and delivery, and the fiscal
impacts of deregulation. However, it is clear from the commission's deadlin=
e
that competition will not take effect in Florida during 2001.

Yet, looking forward, if the California experience is any indication, the
natural-gas shortage should work to Duke's advantage. As wholesale prices
skyrocketed this summer, Duke and other generators were in a prime position
to reap large gains. Duke is still following this tactic on the West Coast.
California regulators just gave approval to the construction of a proposed
1,060-MW unit in Monterey County, which again is natural-gas fired, combine=
d
cycle unit. If California history repeats itself in Florida, Duke and Willi=
ams
will be the co-owners of the only new gas pipeline coming into the state
at a time when natural-gas supplies remain quite low.

The mission of ETS Operations Technical Services (OTS) remains unchanged.  
Our goal is to be an integral part of field operations, provide the highest 
level of technical support possible and assist the field operations teams in 
achieving their objectives.  To that end and as a part of ETS's on-going 
transition of merging  ETS's and EOTT's Operations, I am pleased to announce 
a realignment of ETS Operations Technical Services.  

The purpose of these changes is to better align our technical resources with 
the new Operations Areas and teams and better serve their needs.  Therefore, 
we will form Area Technical Support Teams for each of the Technical 
disciplines (Corrosion, Measurement and Controls & Electrical):  

Max Brown, Director of Corrosion Services, will lead the Corrosion teams.
Kenneth Cessac, Director of Measurement Services, will have responsibility 
for the Measurement Support teams.
Ken Crowl, Director of Controls and Electrical Services will provide 
leadership to the C&E teams.  
Steve Klimesh, Business Consultant, will provide on-going support to ETS on 
UAF and other continuous improvement initiatives.   
The Clifton and Beaver machines shops will remain a part of OTS as we 
continue to grow the Enron Machine and Mechanical Services business.  

The attached organizational charts show the new Tech Services.  The vacancies 
reflected on the charts are an effort to shore up our technical support staff 
for operating the EOTT assets.  In the coming weeks, our Technical Support 
Teams will be further defining their support roles to the Region and team 
level and working diligently to fill these vacancies.  Any thoughts or 
comments that you might have regarding these changes are certainly 
appreciated.  Please feel free to call me or any of the OTS Directors with 
your feedback or for assistance.  Our goal is to continue to provide the best 
service possible to you, our customers.

Dynegy and NRG Energy to Purchase Sierra Pacific Assets
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Dynegy (NYSE: DYN) and NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG) announced a major expansion
of their co-owned generation portfolio in the West through asset purchase
agreements to acquire 1,330 MW of power generation facilities from Sierra
Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).  The facilities include the 740 MW gas-fired
Clark Generating Station and 590 MW of the 605 MW, coal-fired Reid Gardner
Generating Station. The facilities are currently owned by Sierra Pacific
Resources' subsidiary, Nevada Power Company, and serve the growing Las
Vegas market.

ANALYSIS: This $634 million purchase has resulted from regulatory mandates
surrounding the Sierra Pacific-Nevada Power merger, which was completed
in July 1999. Sierra Pacific is undergoing the sale and transfer of all
of its remaining gas, oil and natural-gas fired Nevada generating assets,
which it intends to complete in 2001.

The Reid Gardner and Clark Stations are among the seven asset bundles that
were included in an auction by Sierra Pacific earlier this year. Located
in southeastern Las Vegas, the Clark Generating Station consists of 10
gas- and oil-fired generating units, which as noted total 740 MW. The oldes=
t
unit at the Clark Generating Station became operational in 1955, the newest
in 1994. Specific information about which units at the Clark Generating
Station are included in this purchase was not available. The Reid Gardner
Generating Station consists of four baseload coal-fired units and is locate=
d
52 miles northeast of Las Vegas. According to recent data from the Energy
Information Administration, the California Department of Water Resources
owns about 68 percent of the Reid Gardner Plant. It is not clear what impac=
t
the Dynegy / NRG purchase will have on this organization's ownership in
the plant.

The purchase of the Sierra Pacific assets is subject to approval from the
Federal Trade Commission, FERC and the Nevada Public Utilities Commission,
and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2001. Additional
conditions of the deal include a power purchase agreement for Nevada Power
to buy energy and ancillary services from Dynegy and NRG "at a stable price=
"
until March 2003.

On their own, both companies are leaders in independent power production
and energy supply. Yet this acquisition is the latest in a string of=20
collaborative
efforts between Dynegy and NRG. Together, the companies have been actively
acquiring power plants in Illinois and the West Coast, along with purchases
that they have made independently. In fact, this purchase of assets from
Sierra Pacific marks the sixth asset alliance between Dynegy and NRG.=20
Together,
the two companies jointly own 2,768 MW of power generation facilities in
California and 350 MW in Illinois. In most of the partnerships, and in
the case of this latest purchase from Sierra Pacific, Dynegy markets the
energy produced at the plants and oversees fuel management services, while
NRG manages the operational side.

Last July, Dynegy and NRG entered into a similar agreement to expand the
Rocky Road Power Plant, a natural gas-fired, simple cycle peaking facility
in East Dundee, Illinois. The move into Illinois was an important strategy
for both companies. Of course, Dynegy completed its merger with Illinova
last summer, creating a $22 billion company that is well-positioned to
compete in electric generation, wholesale and retail marketing, and gas
and electric power trading. At the time, the CEO of NRG Energy made it
clear that the Rocky Road plant expansion was part of the two companies'
strategy in becoming a large contributor to the Chicago-area energy market.
Dynegy, in fact, intends to continue acquiring and expanding generation
facilities in Illinois so that it can compete with Exelon Corp.

Moreover, both companies are positioning themselves to be leaders in=20
generation
capacity and power supply, and the purchase of the 1,330 MW from Sierra
Pacific factors in to both of their strategies. Not only does the acquisiti=
on
help to expand both companies' asset base, but it also diversifies their
power supply offerings. For instance, NRG claims that the assets complement
its current gas-fired peaking and intermediate California assets, providing
the benefits of fuel and dispatch level diversification. NRG aims to build
a "top three position in its primary markets." The acquisition of assets
from Sierra Pacific puts NRG into a prime position in the fast-growing
Nevada and Western markets by adding a strong component of baseload generat=
ion
to its portfolio.

In fact, this is the second acquisition that NRG has made from Sierra Pacif=
ic.
Just last month, NRG announced its intent to purchase a 50-percent interest
in the Valmy Power Station, which Sierra Pacific is selling also as a resul=
t
of regulatory mandates. The Valmy Power Station, which is primarily=20
coal-fired,
produces electricity in the northern Nevada and surrounding markets. In
this $273 million deal, NRG acted as an independent buyer.

Dynegy has long claimed that it wants to gain a 10-percent share, or 70,000
MW, of the U.S. electric market over the next five year by acquiring plants=
,
building them or negotiating the right to sell power produced by others.
In order to reach this goal, I had projected last summer that Dynegy might
be looking to merge with another provider to build its scale, considering
the fierce competition it faces from other generation companies. The compan=
y
has now taken a different path to achieve essentially the same result.
The addition of Sierra Pacific's facilities, combined with other assets
that the company has acquired or developed this year, increases Dynegy's
generating capacity by more than 4,000 gross megawatts. Dynegy contends
that this figure is comparable to many industry mergers without the regulat=
ed
transmission and distribution businesses. Dynegy also believes the acquisit=
ion
will support a raise in its earnings forecast for 2001, from $1.75 to $1.80
per share.

Dynegy's goals are pretty ambitious. However, the company has been increasi=
ng
earnings over the last year, so the $1.80 per share target may be attainabl=
e.
For 3Q 2000, Dynegy reported recurring net income of $176.5 million, or
55 cents a share, compared with Dynegy / Illinova pro forma recurring net
income of $96.5 million, or 32 cents per share, for the same period last
year. Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade, whose
reported net income increased to $141.9 million=01*80 percent of the compan=
y's
consolidated net income. There is little doubt that Dynegy and NRG,=20
considering
that they own 2,768 MW of power in the state, benefited from the short
supplies in California this summer, which=01*along with other factors=01*dr=
ove
up the cost for power in the state.

Another interesting element to this announcement is the fact that similar
strategic acquisitions are being made possible by mandated divestiture
that other companies have faced due to merger activity. Just yesterday,
I wrote about Duke and Williams embarking on a joint venture to purchase
the Gulfstream pipeline project from Coastal Corp. This sale was made possi=
ble
because Coastal is being forced to divest the pipeline as a result of its
merger with El Paso Energy. As the old adage goes, one company's loss is
another company's gain, which could be viewed as one of the drawbacks of
M&A activity. Another possible trend is the joint activity we are seeing
between companies. The Duke / Williams  and Dynegy / NRG projects are both
examples of companies that have collaborated on development and acquisition
ventures to support both their joint and individual strategies. As the
energy industry becomes more competitive, like-minded companies may find
that they can actually gain more by developing similar strategic alliances,
rather than following a insular path typically exemplified by, for example,
Southern Company.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20

ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20

Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20

Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20

=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=

around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =

Subject: Dave Schafer

Last saturday at Genie's service in Concordia, KS, I talked with Dave and, 
since he planned to spend most of this week in KC,  agreed to meet in KC for 
talk and lunch.  (He's in KC to support daughter Angie and to be there on 
friday when she goes in for an ultrasound.  Keep your fingers crossed - she 
prefers a girl.)
I went down yesterday morning and returned in the afternoon.  Really a swell, 
if not at times tough, day.  We met and chatted for about 2 hours at his 
hotel before going to pick up Angie for a 1 - 1 1/2 hour lunch - nice little 
Italian place, Cafe Italia  :)  :)
Obviously, the day was a roller coaster ride of emotions.  However, they both 
are doing well - Dave perhaps better than Angie - but both are fine.  At 
times, Dave was his usual "irreverent" self and we enjoyed many chuckles - 
love to listen to the guy go off.  At other times - perhaps we reminesced too 
deeply.
Dave's latest plans are to return to Houston on Saturday.  He mentioned to 
Angie at lunch that Dana and Robert have requested that he stay with them for 
awhile and he will do so.  Angie will follow Dave shortly to help him with 
matters in Houston.  I don't know when she will travel to Houston.
He also brought up the subject of a memorial service in Omaha.  He was 
struggling with his emotions - not wanting to hurt any feelings in Omaha but 
also wanting to get on with the healing process.  He (Angie agreed)  finally 
decided to forego a service in Omaha - relieved I'm sure.

As we're beginning to see the second wave of Order 637 proceeding technical 
conferences being scheduled, here is a brief update on the proposed 
timetables for the first few dockets.  As December kicks off, we are in a 
settlement mode in all the cases, with most pipelines in informal discussions 
with customers/parties to work towards consensus settlements that can be 
filed with the Commission.  

** Note that Koch, adamant that segmentation is not operationally feasible on 
its system, has circulated a settlement proposal on segmentation.  See below.


ANR, RP00-332: 

 After three technical conferences at FERC, ANR is committed to developing a 
total consensus document.  ANR is circulating their latest revisions to 
customers by December 7th, and customers are meeting without the Commission 
or the pipeline to discuss ANR's proposal on December 15th.  A follow-up 
technical conference at FERC is scheduled for January 11, 2001.


Dominion, RP00-344:

Dominion has held at least five meetings with customers to work out a 
settlement in this case.  A technical conference, originally scheduled for 
late October, has been rescheduled with FERC Staff for December 14th.  This 
should be a meeting on a settlement proposal.


Koch, RP00-340:

Koch has circulated revisions to its Order 637 filing, including a settlement 
proposal for segmentation.  There will be a conference call among Koch and 
its customers on December 5th to get comments on the tariff revisions as 
discussed at the October 25th technical conference and the new segmentation 
proposal.  After that call, a follow-up technical conference at FERC should 
be scheduled for sometime in January.

[The segmentation proposal would allow customers broader supplemental rights 
in the zones in which their primary receipt and primary delivery points are 
located.  When points are located in different zones, the customer would be 
entitled to utilize its full MDQ in each zone (in essence doubling their 
MDQ).   It's critical to Koch's offer that all segmented transactions will be 
scheduled on a supplemental basis, as this is the only protection for the 
operational integrity of its system and primary firm services of other 
customers.  The right to segmentation can be waived by customers and it will 
be available on a prospective basis only for new or renegotiated contracts.  
Koch is also proposing a "segmentation fee" to be assessed either to those 
customers utilizing segmentation or by all Koch customers (undecided in the 
proposal).  This fee will be used to recover all costs associated with 
developing the segmentation program and necessary computer system.]


Colorado Interstate, RP00-325:

CIG will circulate revisions by December 1st to its compliance filing as 
discussed at the pipeline's second technical conference on October 26th.  
Parties will send comments to CIG by December 10th.  The schedule, from that 
point, will go into January.  CIG may follow Dominion's lead and schedule 
settlement meetings with parties before meeting with Staff again.


Tennessee, RP00-477:

Tennessee is circulating revisions based on discussions at the November 14th 
technical conference by December 8th.  Parties will meet within two weeks of 
that date to discuss the revisions (either separately or at a FERC technical 
conference).


Kinder Morgan, RP00-343:

Kinder Morgan plans to circulate a revised 637 package by December 15th, with 
a conference call scheduled for January 4th to get feedback from customers on 
the revisions.  The pipeline believes there may not be a need for a second 
technical conference and hopes to file a settlement and implementation plan 
by the end of January.

First,  I thought the inservice was to be earlier than 3rd quarter??  confused
Second, on term I'd suggest we say a minimum of five years, so if someone 
wants to bid for a longer term they can--
Third, in the 3rd paragraph change the reference to term, to as specifed 
above-
Fourth, in the last paragraph, add minimum term of five years again.

Yes, I thought was to not take back space in the EOT area since we have some

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

The FERC has issued an Order Accepting the Letter Agreement between Viking 
and ANR to settle the issue of OFO status at the Marshfield interconnect 
between the two pipes.

The following is a quick synopsis:

Settlement  is effective through March 31, 2001 only.

The following steps will be undertaken in the event ANR is experiencing 
flowing volumes at Marshfield less than 200 Mdth/d and, in ANR's good faith 
reasonable judgment, such shortfall will threaten the operational integrity 
of its pipe in Western Wisconsin.  Also, ANR first has to maximize flowing 
volumes of 86 Mdth/d at NNG-Janesville and 735 Mdth/d at Great Lakes -Crystal 
Falls.

ANR will issue an OFO to the ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt 
capacity at Viking-Marshfield directing their shippers to schedule their gas 
on ANR at Marshfield.
If any shipper does not comply with the OFO, ANR will notify Viking of the 
shipper, default volume, and upstream Viking shipper holding primary delivery 
pt capacity at Marshfield on Viking who is supposed to be supplying the gas.
Viking will then notify the defaulting shipper on their system that they will 
only accept firm primary delivery pt nominations at Marshfield for the volume 
designated by ANR until ANR notifies Viking that the OFO condition has ended.
If the Viking shipper does not comply by taking their gas to Marshfield as 
requested by Viking, Viking will permit ANR to act as shipper's agent and 
nominate for them.

It was noted that ANR will not be a shipper on Viking or hold title to gas 
transported on Viking.

This letter agreement resolves temporarily ANR's request for 33 Mdth/d of 
capacity on Viking they filed on June 19, 2000 in Docket CP00-391-000.

Additional Notes:

The ANR shippers with firm primary receipt pt capacity at Marshfield are:  
Mich Con, UtiliCorp, Wisonsin Electric, Wisconsin Fuel & Light, and Wisconsin 
Public Service.  

The Viking shippers with firm primary delivery pt capacity at Marshfield 
are:  The same shippers as above as well as Engage Energy.

Please approve the attached expense report and forward it to accounting with

to be in by the 13th of this month and this is all she has right now.  Thanks!

PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG) announced that it will acquire a 44.4 MW wind power
generating station near Palm Springs, Calif., to supply electricity to
the Western power grid. PG&E subsidiary National Energy Group is purchasing
the plant from Seawest Wind Power Inc., a San Diego-based developer of
wind energy plants. PG&E expects the plant to enter commercial operation
in the spring of 2001.

ANALYSIS: This is just the latest in what appears to be a generation boom
for PG&E Corp. Just over the last two months, PG&E Corp. also has announced
several other generation projects, both within California and in other
strategic areas of the country. National Energy Group (NEG)=01*PG&E Corp.'s
unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast, primarily
in New England=01*is spearheading all of the new generation projects. PG&E
Corp. claims that its goal is for NEG to be in a position to contribute
30 percent of earnings for the parent company by 2002. Thus, the accelerate=
d
increase of megawatts under the NEG banner certainly is working toward
that goal.

Let's take a quick look at the other generation projects that PG&E Corp.
has announced in addition to the Palm Springs wind power facility. Just
last week, NEG announced a long-term tolling agreement with Southaven Power=
,
an affiliate of Cogentrix Energy. Under terms of the agreement, NEG's=20
subsidiary
PG&E Energy Trading gains rights to the total generation capacity produced
at an 810-MW natural-gas fueled, combined cycle located in Mississippi,
just south of the Tennessee border near Memphis. The deal is noteworthy
because it positions NEG close to the existing TVA and Entergy electric
substations that will deliver the plant's electricity into the region's
transmission grid.

This announcement followed other substantial projects in Southern Californi=
a
and Oregon. The 500-MW Otay Mesa Generating Project, located in San Diego
County, is in the final stages of plant siting. The project represents
the first new power plant built in San Diego County in almost three decades
and, of course, will become operational during a time when low supplies
in California continue to drive up prices. In Oregon, NEG has just submitte=
d
an application to build a new plant in Hermiston, Ore., adjacent to an
already-existing 474-MW plant that NEG co-owns with PacifiCorp. The propose=
d
Umatilla Generating Project will be a combined cycle combustion turbine
that will burn natural gas, with its fuel supply transported via the NEG's
Pacific Northwest natural-gas pipeline.

The growth of NEG is a real success for PG&E Corp. at a time when its=20
regulated
subsidiary is struggling. PG&E Company, the utility that provides natural
gas and electric service to approximately 12 million people in Northern
and Central California, has accumulated about $2.9 billion in debt. PG&E
Co. buys a great deal of the power it provides to customers on the wholesal=
e
market, but because of a retail rate freeze that is still in effect the
company has little control over the rates it can charge customers. Thus,
over the course of last summer, PG&E Co. was paying up to 19 cents per
kilowatt hour while it was only able to charge its customers on average
5 cents per kilowatt hour. PG&E remains embroiled in negotiations with
the CPUC over its petition to retroactively bill customers for its debt.

While the regulated PG&E Co. could find itself wallowing in the red dependi=
ng
on regulatory rulings, NEG has soared. In the 2Q of 2000, PG&E Corp. report=
ed
second quarter earnings from operations of $0.69 per share on a diluted
basis, or $253 million, which represented a 38-percent over diluted earning=
s
from operations in the same quarter in 1999. Much of this success can be
attributed to NEG, which reported 2Q earnings of $37 million, which reflect=
ed
a 233-percent profit increase from the previous year's quarter. The winning
streak continued into 3Q, in which PG&E Corp. reported diluted earnings
from operations at $0.68 per share, or $248 million, and revenues of $7.5
billion, compared with third quarter 1999 revenues of $6.2 billion. This
constituted a 22-percent increase in profit for the parent company. Again,
NEG performed very well; NEG contributions rose, with diluted earnings
from operations of $0.10 per share, or $37 million, on revenues of $5 billi=
on.


Clearly, PG&E Corp. has benefited greatly from NEG's ability, as an=20
unregulated
subsidiary, to sell power outside of the regulated California market. Thus,
it is no wonder that, although PG&E Corp. still considers California to
be an attractive market, the core driver of its strategy is NEG, which
is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated.
In addition, the plant siting process in California historically has been
quite restrictive and lengthy, which also may explain why PG&E Corp. has
chosen to focus its generation efforts primarily outside of its own state.
The siting process in California shows signs of becoming more facile. In
fact, just yesterday, the California Energy Commission adopted emergency
regulations to implement the state's new six-month power plant licensing
process. The new regulations allow for "environmentally advanced" power
plants=01*such as PG&E's wind power plant in Palm Springs=01*to be licensed=
 and
come online more quickly in California.

Currently, PG&E Corp. has ownership and arrangement interests in more than
30 plants, the bulk of which are managed by NEG. The company's generation
portfolio currently consists of 7,000 MW, and more than 10,000 MW in new
power plant development and construction is in production.  As PG&E Corp.
continues to expand its generation base, it probably realizes that current
industry intelligence indicates that a company must have at least 30,000
MW in order to be a formidable player. By comparison, a company like AEP=01=
*
clearly
one the top generation companies in the industry=01*has a worldwide generat=
ing
capacity of 38,404 MW. As NEG is PG&E's primary growth vehicle at the prese=
nt
time, I think we can expect to see additional generation projects announced
by this subsidiary.

Some questions remain. Will PG&E Corp. split its unregulated and regulated
operations into two stand-alone companies, as other utilities such as AEP
and Reliant have recently announced? I checked with my sources at PG&E
Corp., and the official company position is that there are no plans to
restructure in this way at this time. However, PG&E Corp. does acknowledge
the dilemma between asking regulators for the right to bill customers for
its regulated company's debt, while showing a 26-percent profit increase
from its unregulated business.

Also, what are the prospects for PG&E Corp.'s hydroelectric system? Accordi=
ng
to prior agreements, PG&E Corp. was supposed to sell its 3,896-MW=20
hydroelectric
system and the company in fact began to do with a bidding process in Septem=
ber
1999. However, just last August PG&E Corp. petitioned the CPUC to halt
this auction process and instead allow the hydroelectric assets to be sold
from the regulated PG&E Co. to an as-of-yet-unformed unregulated subsidiary
for $2.8 billion. PG&E Corp.'s motivation in this proposal is fairly obviou=
s;
the unregulated subsidiary could reap substantial profits from the sale
of hydropower at market prices. In addition, according to a Sept. 15 report
from Dow Jones Newswires, assuming a book value of about $700 million for
the hydroelectric system, PG&E Corp. could take the remaining $2.1 billion
to pay off the transition debts incurred by PG&E Co. The CPUC and PG&E
Corp. continue to interface regarding the value of the hydroelectric system
and whether or not PG&E Corp. should be allowed to sell the assets to an
unregulated company. While this debate rages on, NEG is free to continue
along its aggressive growth mode.

Steve,

Yes, Dan did ask my opinion on the feasibility of forming a new affiliate 
company (NEWCO).  I know he asked many others as well.  Here is what I told 
him:

There is no regulatory prohibition on NEWCO holding capacity on our pipelines.
NEWCO will have to be set up to meet the creditworthiness standards or else 
we raise the risk of having to lower the creditworthiness test for others.
Under the current rules, even though NEWCO will hold capacity, NEWCO will not 
be a Marketing Affiliate (i.e. requiring separate staff/systems) etc. so long 
as they are not buying or selling gas.  On the flip side, if the new 
affiliate sells gas Including delivered gas), the entity will be a Marketing 
Affiliate and we would have to set if up so all the separation rules are 
met.  I anticipate that FERC's marketing affiliate rules may change in 2001 
such that any energy affiliate, including capacity managers, will be subject 
to the marketing affiliate standards of conduct.  If the success of NEWCO 
depends on sharing unposted information, this strategy is not likely to last 
very long.
Most significantly, when the new affiliate wants to resell/trade its capacity 
rights, it will have to do so through the pipeline's capacity release rules.  
The new affiliate can arrange pre-arranged transactions of less than 30 days, 
but any other deals would have to be posted for bid.   But, I don't think we 
should be scared off just because the deals would have to go through capacity 
release.  NEWCO could do less than 30 day releases at above max. rates on a 
prearranged basis.  NEWCO could also do 1 year of less prearranged deals at 
above max rate,  they would just have to be posted to see if anyone wanted to 
match the deal.


The crux is that there is no regulatory prohibition standing in the way of 
setting up a new affiliate, but it is important to figure out what the new 
affiliate's objective is.  
If the point is to capture short-term, above max rate deals without going 
through a negotiated rate posting, then we may follow a fairly simple 
strategy of setting up a limited NEWCO to buy and sell capacity only.  
If the point is to "churn" capacity trading, then the issues are essentially 
the same as those involved in setting up bid/ask trading on EOL.  
If the point is longer-term, total energy type of deals, then we just need to 
understand that the new affiliate will be a marketing affiliate.

You ask what is being done to further this idea.   I think we need some 
clearer marketing vision of how NEWCO plans to make money (through above max 
rate deals in capacity release?  through rebundled deal? ) before  a more 
definitive list of regulatory steps can be developed.

Shelley,
 I know Danny talked to you a while back about us creating a new company to 
hold capacity on other pipes, etc. What ever happened to that idea? I would 
really like to pursue that avenue as I believe we may be missing out on some 
things we could do. Please let me know the status. Thanks.

 Steve

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which

allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron

Enron Gov't Affairs provided this report on the Energy and Natural Resources 
hearing on Natural Gas markets held this morning.  Please note the suggestion 
that we provide a list of any specific items that we would like to see added 
to energy policy legislation:

Witnesses from the Energy Information Administration, American Gas 
Association, Natural Gas Supply Association and National Association of State 
Energy Officials (NASEO) each testified that gas prices are high because 
demand is greater than supply.
Basically, the hearing provided an opportunity for Western State Senators to 
complain about policies that restrict E&P activity - especially on federal 
lands.  Sen. Murkowski will probably introduce a supply oriented bill in the 
next Congress.
The bottom line is that a number of Senators are deploring the lack of a 
National Energy Policy and seem intent on doing something to rectify such 
omission.  
One specific area of interest of Senator Bingaman seemed to be the need to 
create incentives to encourage pipleine investment.  He seemed especially 
interested in the need for long term contracts to back development
Given that there may be interest to pass Energy Policy legislation, it may be 
worthwhile to put together a wish list of items that affect our bottom line, 
such as accelerated depreciation provisions, tax credits, etc.

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Regulatory doesn't have any issues except internal accounting of the revenue 
received and appropriate calculation of the cost charged.   I'll also forward 
to you Keith's question regarding who has authority over athe assets and 
whether that would require or limit our ability to operate.   MK

Guardian Pipeline said it bought five engine compressor packages totaling 
22,225 hp to provide natural gas compression on its 141-mile, 660 MMcf/d 
pipeline in Illinois and Wisconsin. It purchased the compressors from 
Compressor Systems, Inc. of Midland, TX. Combined, the compressors will be 
capable of delivering up to 750 MMcf/d of gas on Guardian. "Guardian Pipeline 
is continuing to make steady progress. This purchase agreement for a major 
equipment component keeps Guardian on track to meet its scheduled in-service 
date of November 2002," said George Hass, Guardian project manager. A final 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision on the Guardian Pipeline 
is expected by early 2001. In June, FERC issued a Preliminary Determination 
that the pipeline is in the public interest, subject to the outcome of its 
environmental review, and in July, FERC staff issued a favorable Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement on the project. In addition, the Public 
Service Commission of Wisconsin made a preliminary dete
rmination on the project in October, accepting the economics of a Wisconsin 
Gas lateral pipeline, which will connect Guardian with Wisconsin Gas' 
distribution system. Guardian will transport gas from interconnections with 
Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern, and NGPL at the Chicago hub near 
Joliet, IL, to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets starting in 
November 2002. Its sponsors include CMS, WICOR and Viking Gas.

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, November 7, 2000 from Phoenix, AZ
CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance (or Lack Thereof) of Information
Technology in the Energy Industry
By: Jon T. Brock, Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the "CEO Mega Panel: View From
the Top" at the 48th annual EEI/AGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc=
e
in Phoenix this week.  The moderator was Charles Bayless, former chairman,
president and CEO of Illinova.  The remaining three CEOs included: Keith
Stamm, CEO, Aquila Energy; Dr. Matthew Cordaro, president and CEO, Midwest
ISO; and James Pignatelli, chairman, president and CEO, UniSource Energy.


ANALYSIS:  This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner. The
conference organizers did a good job in getting a cross-section of the
energy industry in transition.  The trading organization specialist was
represented with Aquila, the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes=
t
ISO, and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource
Energy.  Each panelist was asked what role information technology (I/T)
played in their respective organization.  Their answers may surprise you.

Dr. Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first.  Dr. Cordaro stressed
that I/T was very critical to the operation of an ISO, saying "it is=20
essentially
the foundation of the ISO." He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started
from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands
of transactions every week in a real-time operation.  Among the=20
responsibilities
that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are: monitoring the congestion on
the grid and taking appropriate action, preventing gaming through market
monitoring, settlement processing (who owes who what), and handling the
dispute process.

The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati=
on
(RTO) Alliance on July 20 of this year to deliver an integrated control
center system (ICCS) that, when complete, will provide $50 million in=20
infrastructure
for the MISO.  The RTO Alliance, which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation
of Seattle, Open Access Technology International (OATI) of Minneapolis,
Perot Systems of Dallas, Texas, and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City,
Utah, will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable
MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission. The hardware
and software in the ICCS project will support MISO's operational functions
including transmission planning, reservation, scheduling, real-time monitor=
ing
and control, settlement and billing.  Dr. Cordaro also stated that Lodestar
was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to
AT&T Solutions.

Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next.  Keith began by clarifying Aquila's
focus as trading: owning very little assets in a high-volume, low-margin,
high-volatility business.  I/T is very important in the trading business.
 Real-time information must be known and disseminated appropriately to
the right individuals.  Keith believes that one of Aquila's strategic asset=
s
and strengths is its risk management system.  Aquila strives for a real-tim=
e
calculation of risk.

Aquila Energy, a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United, Inc., has been a surprisin=
g
winner in the trading marketplace this year, showing a 113-percent growth
since last year with $9 billion total revenue for the past six months,
of that $55 million in trading revenue compared to $18 million in 1999.
The EBIT was $34.2 million vs. $9 million a year ago. Aquila has gathered
top traders and intellectual, financial, and risk management personnel
to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race.

Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies =01* including
top traders AEP and Duke Energy =01* as an investment step Aquila perceived
was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin=
g
platforms. The Energy Trading Consortium (Duke Energy, AEP, Aquila Energy,
Reliant Energy, Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy) is
in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap
benefits from the transaction cost, liquidity, volume and speed of exchange=
.
 This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many
buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to one-to-many.  Another
competitor recently launched is e-Speed's TradeSpark.

James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial
statements concerning information technology.  James stated that I/T in
the vertically integrated utility is not strategic, at least not at the
present time.  James believes that I/T will become strategic someday (in
the deregulated market).

James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the I/T arena.
 He mentioned pulling in his I/T folks and saying, "Let's switch the=20
distribution
network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances, we'll
switch back to AC." While James' comments may have been controversial with
the more than 500 attendees and approximately 50 energy CIOs in the audienc=
e,
he does have a point.  The vertically integrated utility's core strength
is to generate power and distribute it to "captive" customers reliably.
 While some I/T systems (like outage management and SCADA devices) may
be strategic in this sense, the other parts of I/T are questionable and
could be candidates for outsourcing.

James claims to be working on B-2-B and B-2-C initiatives at the moment.
 His vision for B-2-C is a smart chip in the residence that has access
to instantaneous pricing information.  The residence will "buy" electricity
for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce
load, thereby reducing the T&D utility to a simple conduit for service.


James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior
to its sale to AES.  In 1997, Tucson Electric invested $3 million in NEV
and Charles Bayless (then Tucson Electric's chairman, president and chief
executive officer) and James Pignatelli (Tucson Electric's senior vice
president and chief operating officer) served on New Energy Venture's=20
administrative
committee.

It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace
as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated
I/T systems.  If one were to stop and think about it, deregulation could
not occur without the complex I/T systems that are employed today in the
marketplace.  I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have
thought about an unbundled electric marketplace.  It is, in fact, undoing
their design of an integrated electric system constructed for operational
efficiency.

Effective immediately, Joe Jeffers, Manager of Technical Training and Skill 
Based Pay Administration, and his team of Dick Heitman, Cliff McPherson, 
Andrea Woody and Lupi Trevino will move from ETS Human Resources to ETS 
Operations Technical Services.  Joe will report to Steve Klimesh.  

This move will better align Technical Training and SBP Administration with 
Operations and enhance the interfaces that take place between this group and 
ETS Operations management and the field teams. 

Joe and his team have provided outstanding support to Operations in the past, 
and it is expected that this high standard of customer service will 
continue.  We will be sending more information in the very near future with 
regard to the individual support accountabilities of the team members.  

Please join me in welcoming this team and helping to make their transition a 
smooth one.

The New Power Company: Going Green While Stock Price Drops
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

The New Power Company (TNPC, NYSE: NPW), which bills itself as the first
national residential and small business energy provider, announced that
it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy, Inc. to provide
wind-generated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area. Under the
terms of the agreement, TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community
Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast 
Pennsylvania.
The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of 2001.

ANALYSIS: This is an interesting development, especially considering that
TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant
number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from
PECO Energy. This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers
who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain. On the other hand,
it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company,
founded earlier this year by Enron (along with partners AOL and IBM).

As you may recall, just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached
an agreement with PECO Energy to supply "competitive default service" for
approximately 300,000 of PECO's residential electricity customers who have
not selected a competitive energy service provider. Green Mountain formally
challenged this agreement, arguing that the PECO/TNPC agreement is "not
in the public interest" and that Green Mountain should have been awarded
the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question.
Thus, it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of
wind power to its portfolio of services. Up to this point, TNPC has been
working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers,
such as the approximately 285,000 natural gas and 20,000 electricity customers
it purchased from Columbia Energy Group. The acquisition of the customers
in PECO's territory was a major coup for TNPC, which is still in start-up
mode. Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from
PECO, the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further
objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity
as a provider of renewable energy.

Community Energy, the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power
that it will market, began making wind power available to businesses in
Pennsylvania last year. TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy
in fixed kilowatt-hours, allowing for more customized service and tailored
use of power. Interestingly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed
a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about
37,500 MW of green power to aggregated state agencies. This indicates that
desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania, and any energy
provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green
power in its portfolio. Thus, while renewable energy was not a fundamental
component of TNPC's original business plan, the company appears to be moving
in this direction (at least in states where it is strategic to do so).

However, this announcement comes on the heels of TNPC's announcement of
its third-quarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price. TNPC's
revenues for 3Q 2000 were $18.2 million, derived from the sale and delivery
of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states 
(Pennsylvania
and New Jersey). Gross profit was $1.3 million, or 7.2 percent of revenues.
Yet, the loss on earnings before income tax (EBIT) was $68.3 million. The
net loss for the quarter was $69.9 million, or $2.96 per basic share. TNPC
reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history.
Therefore, the company contends that its year-over-year comparisons are
not meaningful or indicative of future performance. The company's goal
for 4Q 2000 is to achieve revenues of approximately $60 to $63 million,
with an estimated year-end customer count of 340,000.

Eugene Lockhart, TNPC's CEO, said he was pleased with the 3Q performance.
Lockhart contends that TNPC "achieved both our overall financial performance
targets and business objectives," and referenced the fact that the company
is still building its "systems and architecture" so that it can continue
to penetrate additional competitive markets. In addition, TNPC has raised
approximately $546 million in funding which the company is using primarily
to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation.

However, despite its positive outlook, after TNPC made its earnings 
announcement
its shares took a nosedive, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy
provider's ability to meet its objectives. The shares closed last Friday
at $9, which is a dramatic drop from the average price of $25 before the
3Q earnings announcement. TNPC issued its IPO on Oct. 5, 2000, at a price
of $21 per share, which at the time seemed quite high for a start-up energy
company with a limited track record. A day after its opening, the stock
closed at $27 per share. The stock was received so favorably for two reasons,
in my estimation. First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments.
In two separate, private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital
Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214
million in start-up capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron
is the majority owner of TNPC, with 57-percent control. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and
small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC. Together
with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has come out of the gate
running with a significant beginning customer base of over 325,000 customers.

Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock, and
the company is at a crossroads. In order to keep its momentum on track,
TNPC needs to do two things. First, it needs to acquire additional customers
to expand its base. Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best 
opportunity
to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace
in those states. Second, as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov. 6, 2000,
energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative
fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors.
Consequently, it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that
it will be a provider of wind power. This could potentially send the stock
price on a upward climb again, despite the fact that financial success
of the company is still unproven.

Regarding the customer base expansion, Ohio looks like the next state that
TNPC will target. Just last week, the company filed an application with
the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state.
Yet, it's clear that TNPC is still fine-tuning its marketing approach.
In Ohio, it is offering customers competitive energy prices, flexible payment
and pricing choices, and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive,
but there is no mention in TNPC's application that it will provide renewable
energy in Ohio.

Moreover, several questions remain. Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role
for itself as a renewable energy provider, or it just providing wind power
in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state? Will the addition
of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC? Will TNPC 
demonstrate
revenues of $63 million in 4Q 2000? And where will the company's next 
acquisition
of customers take place? All of these questions directly impact the future
success of TNPC.

Presenters:  Pat Brennan and I attended the Virtual Power meeting this 
morning representing Regulatory.  Drew and Dari were there from law.  Drew 
led the presentation and covered the matrix/template that out study group 
submitted earlier.

Audience:  Rockey Storie, Kevin Hyatt, Bob Burleson in Houston.  Kent Miller 
and Tim Johanson in Omaha.

The material, presentation and discussion was well received and timely.  
Rockey indicated that, in a recent status meeting with Danny McCarty, Danny 
had asked if the commercial people were discussing their proposed deals with 
Law and Regulatory.  Rockey responded that there had been contact and 
discussion under way. 

As for the discussion, the audience easily and quickly picked up on the 
template format with most of the questions/comments focusing, as one might 
expect, on revenue/COS bottom line issues.  Pat was able to provide 
additional definition and comment to the group discussion and template 
display.

Dari led us through the "jurisdictional" issues regarding electric and gas 
service.  The abandonment of service concern that we expressed at the study 
group meetings was more or less put to bed when Marketing responded that, 
based on field operations input, turn-around time to stop a turbine, engage a 
different operation (e.g., run a compressor) could be accomplished in 1 -2 
hours.  "Gearbox" technology to shift operations is available.  We also 
touched on the jurisdictionality issue associated with the purchase of a 
compression service  - ala monetization.

Other concepts were brought up with regard to deal structure and financing 
alternatives but were tabled for the moment.  There was also a question, to 
be pursued, regarding air quality/permits using the engine to compress for 
natural gas service vs running a generator.

I really feel that the meeting was successful and appreciated in that, at the 
least, we were able to congeal much info on the matrix and facilitate what 
could have been a very lengthy discussion into a relatively brief meeting.  
Drew concluded by stating that the template should not be distributed outside 
ETS.  He suggested that, on a case-by-case basis, our study group of Legal 
and Regulatory personnel could quickly respond to case specific issues in a 
customized response that the commercial dealmaker could provide to their 
client(s).

Currently I have 2 machines (one on 41, one on 47) plus a laptop.
Jean McFarland contacted me a couple of months ago with this idea.  Basically 
we would be replacing 3 computers with one laptop.  I will probably want to 
get a regular sized monitor for my work station on 41 (I do not know if this 
is included in the "docking station" entry).
If you like, I can get Jean to do the math on how much we would be saving, if 
anything.  My machine on 47 is really out of date.  Someone else can use my 
brand new computer on 41 though.

SCE, California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans; FERC to Meet This
Week
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Southern California Edison (SCE) filed a four-point plan calling on the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to act by year's end to settle
the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting
from California's dysfunctional electricity market. This follows a separate
measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy
purchases. FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov. 1 to discuss the California
power market and remedies for the state's troubled move to deregulate retail
service, which caused drastic price spikes this summer.

ANALYSIS: This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding 
California's
energy market. FERC's meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with
a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some
sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market.

First, let's establish what SCE is proposing. SCE has petitioned the CPUC
to take four immediate steps: 1). Support market reform by providing utilities
with greater freedom to contract for longer-term supplies of power, completing
review of SCE's bilateral contract proposals, and rectifying market structure
problems that have become apparent; 2). Confirm that utilities will be
able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of
customers; 3). Implement a post-rate-freeze rate stabilization plan instead
of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile
wholesale power costs, and provide for a modest rate increase beginning
Jan. 1, 2001, to avoid larger future increases; and 4). End the uncertainty
about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets.

I think this can all be translated as follows. 1). SCE (and presumably
PG&E) want to overturn California's strong resistance against bilateral
contracts. Under California restructuring law, the local distribution company
must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange. Bilateral contracts
with generators are largely prohibited, meaning that currently in California
suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities, as is allowed
in other states such as Texas. 2). SCE and PG&E are both in severe debt,
due to accumulated under-collection resulting from the disparity between
the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service 
territories.
SCE's debt is about $2.4 billion, while PG&E's debt could be as much as
$2.9 billion. Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their
debt. 3). SCE and PG&E want to avoid the sky-high prices that San Diego
Gas & Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to 
market-based
prices this summer. SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase
rates by less than 10 percent, keeping rates at 1996 levels when adjusted
for inflation. SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more
formal proposal to the CPUC, but believes that the less-than-10 percent
increase would be sufficient to recoup its $2.4 billion debt if it were
in place for four to five years. 4). AB1890 strongly encouraged that the
California IOUs divest their power plants, as part of the agreements for
stranded cost recovery. SCE sold 12 natural-gas plants, and presently has
two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow.
The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of
plants currently in escrow, and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide
whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed.

The California ISO's proposal is more specific, but also geared toward
market stabilization. The Cal-ISO wants to implement a $100/MWh bid cap
(reduced from $250/MWh) on electricity purchases in the ISO's spot market.
However, the Cal-ISO's plan includes several exemptions, including those
generators that can prove they will lose money at the $100 rate, generators
that contract 70 percent of their supply to serve California customers,
and generators producing less than 50 MW (renewable power, imported power,
etc.) Thus, the current rate cap of $250/MWh would remain in place and
serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from
the $100 payment cap.

Further, the Cal-ISO wants to require that generators contract 70 percent
of their capacity in forward markets, and that users schedule at least
85 percent of their load in forward markets. The Cal-ISO contends that
California IOUs should be easily able to schedule 85 percent of their load
by entering into contracts with generators. The Cal-ISO wants to affix
a "real-time deficiency charge" on both generators and users that do not
use the forward markets. The Cal-ISO submitted its plan to FERC because
it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California, but on
a national basis.

Although the Cal-ISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective,
the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its
own state. The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden
on the Cal-ISO's Real-Time Market, which was designed to handle only 5
percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets, but in fact is
handling about 20 to 30 percent. The Cal-ISO proposal seems to be taking
into account the problem of an out-of-sync wholesale/retail market by 
encouraging
generation to stay in the state.  Otherwise, capped generators may sell
power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed $100
per megawatt hour in the neighboring states.  Should FERC approve this
national rate cap, however, it will be precedent setting and will signal
that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated.

As noted, FERC plans to meet on Nov. 1 to examine the California market
in detail. FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late
August, with its investigation focused on the summer's price spikes, the
state's market structure including the Cal-ISO and the Power Exchange,
as well as market-based sellers in California. The meeting this week 
reportedly
will disclose findings from FERC's investigation and "consider proposed
remedies."

 SCE's proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on
FERC's agenda for approval. However, it is likely that whatever FERC decides
will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCE's plan. In particular,
FERC will be examining the issue of market power, and whether or not any
generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system
by withholding generation to drive up energy prices. And the problem is
by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer. Even though
the summer demand season has now ended, wholesale prices remain high, a
problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural
gas across the country.

   GOOD MORNING, 

I ask that you please attend one of these scheduled Safety Meetings.

The video is meant to be an emotional reminder to all of us on the importance 
of safety, and the critical nature of 100% of our employees supporting our 
safety program 100% of the time.  This would mean everyone in the Omaha 
office, as well as those in the field.

Safety is something that none of us can take for granted.  The 'Testament to 
Safety' video will certainly be a reminder of that fact. 

Again, I urge you to put it on your calendar.
 
Mike Nelson

Subject: "TESTAMENT TO SAFETY" PROGRAM


The "Testament to Safety" video was developed to make us all realize that we 
work in a potentially dangerous environment each and every day.  The video is 
very personal, emotional and poignant.  You will hear from three Enron 
employees who experienced life altering injuries.  The program will last 
about 45 minutes and will be presented in Room #149 at the following times:

   Thursday, December 7   Friday, December 8
      9 a.m.       9 a.m.
    10 a.m.     10 a.m.
      2 p.m.       2 p.m.
      3 p.m.       3 p.m.

Please attend the session that is the most convenient for you.  Other 
sessions will be scheduled and presented until every employee has had the 
opportunity to see this video.

A memorial poster has been placed next to your signed "Declaration of 
Inter-Dependence" in each floor's kitchen area.

Rich,
Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our 
next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to 
operate their Griffith system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need 
to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be 
necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting 
word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi=
ng
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ=
ers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri=
es
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre=
sent
an arguably larger market than the United States=01*Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europ=
e
to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billi=
on
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why=01*the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decisi=
on
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merge=
r
strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips=20
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi=
c
contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradin=
g
and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci=
al
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron Japan=
's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin=
g
Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan=
ies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both=20
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin=
g
to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closel=
y
may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

     Subscribers to TheLaw.net's Custom Web Browser already know that the 
days of submitting solely to the "Wexis" duopoly are over.

     Why limit your options to cherry-picking subscription slices from the 
Wexis pay-per-view menu when TheLaw.net offers an all-you-can-eat, unlimited 
access buffet for under $25 a month annualized; a subscription that has as 
its centerpiece unlimited access to the largest searchable database of 
Federal and state appellate case law on the planet next to those provided by 
the big-two compusearchers. Personal Editions are just $295 a year. Annual 
Workgroup Editions are just $995 for the first five users. 
http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm

--MORE THAN JUST CASE LAW
     Wexis, of course, offers us a vast array of high-quality resources, with 
many slick bells and whistles. But for most of us, these resources exist in 
name only and deviating from the plan usually means getting hammered with 
unwieldy transaction charges. In contrast, TheLaw.net puts cases, statutes, 
regulations, rules, forms, news, executive agency databases, legislative 
tracking tools, full-text law journals, a massive reference desk and Federal, 
state and local court resources just a click or two away on your desktop.

     As legal research and reference materials continue to migrate online the 
commercial value of this information bottoms out for the few who have the 
time and talent to find it scattered among the thousands of servers 
controlled by governments, academia and non-profits. For the rest of us, 
there's TheLaw.net

--NO RISK 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
     Your no risk Personal, Convenience or Workgroup Edition includes an 
unconditional 30 day money-back guarantee. Five attorneys in a firm or 
workgroup, for example, get unlimited use for an entire year for just $995; 
individual users for just $295. You'll be up and running in minutes and we 
can deliver your software today!

SCIENTECH IssueAlert, November 14, 2000
SmartEnergy Rounds Up $15 million in Financing; Is an IPO in the Works?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing,
having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities,
venture capital and global banks. SmartEnergy, a privately held Internet-based
energy service provider active in New York, plans to use the funding as
working capital to "rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment 
schedule."

ANALYSIS: You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago
(IssueAlert, Oct. 11), when I drew attention to the fact that the online
start-up was taking customers away from ConEdison. In existence only since
April 1999, SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential
and small business customers. Under a promotion currently under way in
New York, SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to 40 percent on energy
through the winter months for natural-gas customers in the boroughs of
New York City and Westchester County. Capitalizing on ongoing threats about
low supplies of oil and natural gas, SmartEnergy is using the so-called
"energy crisis" to lure customers away from the traditional utility by
locking in current natural-gas rates over the course of the next 12 months
under its "Smart Fixed Rate" plan. As a policy, SmartEnergy hedges the
products that its sell to customers, so that neither the company nor its
customers is exposed to energy market price risks. In addition, SmartEnergy
has offered 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement
to secure customers.

As I discussed last month, an advantage that online energy providers such
as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility. As utilities
try to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online
companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products
and billing options to customers. In addition, operating online allows
SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets. Up until
now, SmartEnergy's marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York
state. However, the company claims that it will be serving six states,
including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, by the end of this year. SmartEnergy
expects to be serving all 25 deregulated states by the end of 2001, and
the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support
this anticipated growth.

Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers
a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns
as the energy industry continues to become deregulated. Investors that
are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy, WPS Resources Corporation,
Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors. In 
addition,
there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round, including
Dexia Ventures, the private equity arm of Dexia Bank, a USD $211 billion
asset bank based in Belgium; KBC Bank; and venture capitalist groups Trust
Capital, Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures. The inclusion
of both American and European investors is important. Coupled with 
SmartEnergy's
intention to operate in all 25 U.S. states that are deregulating, the fact
that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy
plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic. The fact
that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform
of worldwide service. In fact, Alliant Energy identified "the strong growth
of the Internet and technology in the energy segment" as a key reason why
it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy.

In fact, the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison, Wis.-based Alliant
has been in existence for several months. The utility's non-regulated 
subsidiary
Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy
to expand a decidedly e-focused business. The partnership with SmartEnergy
represents Alliant's new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies
offering state-of-the-art technology and new products and services for
customers. In fact, Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as "the energy
company of today and tomorrow" and believes that it has a platform that
can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world.

Of course, my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn
toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy. It would certainly be an obvious
move for the private company to head in this direction, especially now
as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street. I've
written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like
Evergreen Solar, Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid
IPOs as a result of, in my opinion, their business models in new technologies
and / or alternative fuels. There is arguably a general perception within
the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies
into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the
energy market in the next two years. With few exceptions, energy companies
exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several
months have performed comparatively well.

As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that
reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid,
start-up companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche.
Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer
service, again resulting from its online presence. Customer interaction
can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet, enabling 24/7
account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at
any time.

The downside, of course, is customer reluctance to sign up with a start-up
company that they may not know. In addition, SmartEnergy faces tough 
competition
from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in 
deregulated
markets, including Utility.com and Essential.com. None of these companies
has yet gone public, and are instead focusing on building critical mass
and establishing their brand identities. Yet, of the three, SmartEnergy
may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion, and could be on the fast
track to an IPO in the near term.

Subject: Re: TW  

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

NATURAL GAS REPORT--RESIDENTIAL GAS COSTS RISING
Residential costs for gas will rise this winter as the wholesale cost of
natural gas has doubled since last year. Local distribution companies
will feel opposing pressures of reducing the impact on customers,
while recouping their costs.

* This is not a one-year phenomenon. Wholesale prices are expected
to remain high through 2003.

* Rising gas prices were previously overshadowed by high heating
oil costs, but the spotlight will soon turn to gas as residential prices
could rise by 50 percent or more.

Yes, they specifically wanted "contacts and phone numbers for our major 
shippers".  (Steve January, please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Steve is the 
person who received the call/request from FERC.  Steve, maybe you could 
elaborate for Mary Kay and Drew on the information the FERC has been

Not having received the request,  it seems like the quantity related to the 
contract would provide them better info than a contact name and phone 
number-  did they specifically ask for that inf0??  upon answer, work 
directly with Drew as I'll be out.   MK

Subject: FERC Request

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=

Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20

that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=

Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=

Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=

growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

I'm told that the four states conducting the inquiry into UtiliCorp's gas 
purchases and capacity release methodologies have a conference call with 
UtiliCorp on Friday.

UCU has admitted an "accounting error" to Michigan and has offered a $100,000 
refund.  The PSC is looking for something more in the area of $20 million.

You remember that Nick Schwartz was in Lansing the same day we were last 
month giving a deposition.  Although it was supposed to be on another subject 
it quickly turned to this issue. A copy of the deposition is attached below.

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.

I think we need to follow closely the Koch settlement conference concerning 
segmentation as it relates to their zones and their "segmentation fee". I 
have not been following this proceeding at all but feel we should watch 
closely.

Thanks. Julia

Just so you can see how this is evolving...
I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because 
it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only 
information she still needs from us, I think.  
I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

Since PNM is the only party taking issue here, we might do a quickie answer  
clarifying the transportation and fuel language.   This might enable us to 
get the type of netting and trading we want ($ vs. volumes) for both shipper 
and operator imbalances at least until the GISB standards of netting and 
trading are approved.  Maria

I'm inclined to agree that its not worth responding to.  They also argued 
that imbalances should not be dollar valued before netting and trading are 
available, but that strikes me as an industry wid e policy issue and not a TW 
specific issue.  Any other thoughts?  DF

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

Subject: Pueblo

Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating 
with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the 
plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been 
ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls 
apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it 
related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement 
with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly 
payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the 
ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we 
are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis 
has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I 
told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd 
suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and 
advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF

Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

"The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly," said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. "The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up." 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. "We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now." 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. "We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably," said Exner. "The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not." 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. "We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California."

Travel: - OUT OF OFFICE
I will be on vacation MONDAY  - 11/6/00
I expect to be in the Houston office the remainder of the week
I will be attending a Cross Function Team meeting in Albuquerque on 11/15/00 
- presenting the UAF Fundamentals information

GPG Continuous Improvement Task Force - Measurement and Invoicing Process:
We are in the final stages of setting up a meeting of the units named in the 
CI Accountability / Responsibility matrix.  As you will recall, one of the 
recommendations of the CI team was to define and reach agreement on roles 
relative to the 37 items identified during the project.  We have gathered all 
the Regional UAF teams input and now need to reach consensus with the other 
organizations.

EOTT UAF 
I met with Dave Daigle, Jim Martel and Don Doerr this past Tuesday.  I 
believe we have agreement on report generation, timing and distribution such 
that EOTT gain (loss) reporting can roll into the gas UAF reporting.
I  will reduce the agreement / process to paper as soon as I get a chance.

Training Project for  Phil Lowry  (Dave Schafer)

A meeting has been set up with Phil for 11/7/00 to review the data we have to 
date.
David Marye has done a fine job of putting together the data.

MISC:
I have spent a fair amount of time this week digging out data for various 
looks as TW UAF and its possible contribution to revenue.  I still have some 
questions I need to resolve.  Terry Galassini and I will be reviewing the 
data today.

PG&E Co. Proposes Huge Rate Increase to Recover Debt
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Last Wednesday, PG&E Co. proposed a five-year "rate stabilization plan"
that would allow the utility to pass along to customers more than $3 billio=
n
in power costs incurred last summer. Under PG&E's plan, submitted to the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for approval, average=20
residential
bills of $54.50 would increase to about $63.50 a month as of Jan. 1, 2001.
This amount is intended to accommodate potential wholesale price spikes
after an existing rate freeze ends by 2002. However, a portion of the incre=
ase
also would go to paying down the $3.4 billion in unforeseen charges that
PG&E insists are not the utility's responsibility.

ANALYSIS: Although most of the publicity related to the price spikes this
past summer focused on San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), the legacy of
the market problems in California is perhaps being carried by PG&E and
Southern California Edison (SCE), as both utilities have yet to fully enter
competitive markets within the state. This latest proposal from PG&E is
an attempt to save itself from what many have claimed will be financial
insolvency unless it can free itself from the staggering debt it currently
carries.

Let's first understand how PG&E found itself in the red, since this is
critical to the utility's argument that customers should be responsible
for the debt.  Due to its obligation to provide energy to customers in
its service territory, PG&E must its power on the wholesale market. In
addition, under California's restructuring mandates, PG&E had to buy its
power out of the Power Exchange (PX) rather than establishing bi-lateral
contracts with suppliers. The combination of low supply and high demand
drove up the wholesale cost of power in the PX this summer, which PG&E
faced as a buyer. Due to the retail rate freeze that is still in effect,
PG&E has been unable to pass on the high cost of power to its customers.
Although reports vary, on average PG&E has been paying up to 19 cents per
kilowatt hour on the wholesale market, when by law it is only allowed to
charge its customers on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour.  As a result
of these factors, PG&E has paid about $3.4 billion more to suppliers than
it can bill customers, and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions
each month. This explains the utility's motivation in wanting relief from
its debt, and also its argument that=01*since it was obligated to buy the
power for customers in the first place=01*its customers should ultimately
carry the burden for the high costs.

PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest,
or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,
something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due
to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the
utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs
are already paid off. Consequently, PG&E has been lobbying to the CPUC
for several months for various options that would all result in PG&E custom=
ers
picking up the $3.4 billion tab. The utility first proposed to retroactivel=
y
bill customers for the debt. This latest proposal changes the course a
bit to provide for a rate increase, but the end result would essentially
be the same.

Under the proposal, PG&E's rate freeze would end Jan. 1, 2001, and resident=
ial
and small business customers would begin paying 6.5 cents per kilowatt
hour for five years, compared with the current wholesale costs of 15.2
cents per kilowatt hour (generation costs). Without such a rate stabilizati=
on
plan in place, PG&E warns that an average monthly bill could soar to more
than $108 after the rate freeze is lifted. The utility also contends that
the portion of the new rate that goes toward paying for the summer's high
prices amounts to less than 20 percent of the total monthly increases.
To reduce the impact on low-income customers, the utility plans to increase
their discount to 25 percent from the 15 percent they currently receive.
PG&E said there would be further increases on an annual basis if rates
proved not to be high enough to cover costs. If the deficit of uncollected
costs grew by $1 billion, for example, then rates at the start of 2002
would rise by one cent a kilowatt hour or around 15 percent to 7.5 cents.

Skeptics=01*including some within the CPUC=01*say PG&E is simply looking to=
 protect
its own interests. Carl Wood, a CPUC commissioner, referred to PG&E's propo=
sal
as "volume two of their bailout request" and noted that the request results
in a rate increase for most customers and complete recovery of all of the
utility's debt. The consumer group TURN contends that PG&E, and not custome=
rs,
is obliged to eat the cost of the debt it incurred. The group also argues
that, although PG&E has cast its proposal under a guise of customer=20
protection,
the proposal only really serves to assure PG&E of full recovery of its
debt. In addition, TURN noted that PG&E submitted its proposal to the CPUC
on the day before Thanksgiving, conceivably to downplay media attention
and avert an immediate negative reaction from the CPUC.

PG&E remains adamant that its customers should be made to pay off its debt,
and is determined to go to court if the CPUC does not approve its proposal.
PG&E believes that federal law would supports its right to bill customers
for debt it believes it accrued on its customers' behalf.

PG&E's proposal comes at a time when the utility's reputation has taken
a beating. A current report from the San Francisco Chronicle reveals that
the CPUC received more than 17,000 complaints about PG&E from 1997 to 1999.
According to the report, PG&E received more than three times as many=20
complaints
per customer as SDG&E during the past three years, which is quite significa=
nt
considering that SDG&E customers were exposed to bills that increased by
two and three times their normal amounts last summer. The comparison betwee=
n
PG&E and SDG&E was made because they are the only major private utilities
in the state to offer both electric and gas service.

PG&E also accounts for an unusually high percentage of complaints statewide=
.
>From 1997 to 1999, PG&E complaints represented 56 percent of the total
filed with the CPUC, even though it only has 39 percent of gas customers
and 46 percent of electric customers served by regulated utilities in the
state. Nearly three out of four complaints filed with the PUC against PG&E
concerned billing problems. In its own defense, PG&E claims that it faces
a unique set of weather-related conditions that make the service it provide=
s
to customers more fraught with problems, which consequently results in
more complaints.

It is unknown how state regulators will rule on PG&E's request, but prior
comments from Wood and other commissioners would indicate that the utility'=
s
proposal will be rejected. This casts a dark shadow over the future of
PG&E as, without being able to bill customers for its debt, it is uncertain
how the utility will continue to remain financially solvent. Ironically,
unregulated subsidiaries under the parent company PG&E Corp. continue to
perform well and show profits. Yet, the huge debt of PG&E Co. may become
an overwhelming anchor around the parent company's neck in the very near
future.

The reviews are in and TheLaw.net is saving subscribers tons of time and 
money by offering a new way to solve old research problems at a low, flat 
rate that's affordable to anyone.

--AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE
Noted law cybrarian Genie Tyburski writes that "[t]he busy sole 
practitioner...may find TheLaw.net an inexpensive alternative to Lexis or 
Westlaw and a helpful index to select legal information sites." Says a 
practitioner from Colorado: "I found it easy to use (certainly easier than 
Lexis/Westlaw)."

Our subscribers in larger environments have found that TheLaw.net is the 
perfect complement to any West or Lexis plan that may be limited to your 
jurisdiction or practice area; an addition that allows you to go outside that 
premium wine package and survey a significant subset of the universe without 
any transaction, printing, viewing or download hassles.

--LEXIS BILL SLASHED BY 90%
An intellectual property firm subscriber of ours in Chicago dropped us an 
email just last week to say that "[y]our concept is great....for the money 
there is no better bargain for legal research. Our Lexis bills have dropped 
to 10% of what they were before. Thanks!"

Of course your results may vary, but for less than $25 a month annualized 
TheLaw.net gives you all the efficiency of electronic case law research 
without any of the conflicting emotions that come from a meter being held to 
your head. As the list below makes plain, TheLaw.net is indeed the world's 
best value for Federal and state appellate case law research whether you are 
at work, at home or on the road. And best of all, you get everything we 
have--all you can eat--for the same low, flat rate.

--KEEPING UP WITH THE LAW AND THE INTERNET
Everyone knows that in its raw form the Internet looks like a law library 
with the books all over the floor. That's why we developed this best 
practices software solution which incorporates a 50,000 link drop-down menu 
system for getting around online, together with our proprietary searchable 
database of Federal and State Appellate cases, 167 jurisdictions in all, over 
four million cases, updated daily.

NO RISK 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
Your no risk Personal, Convenience or Workgroup Edition includes an 
unconditional 30 day money-back guarantee. Five attorneys in a firm or 
workgroup, for example, get unlimited use for one year for only $995; 
individual users for just $295. You'll be up and running in mere minutes and 
we can deliver your software today!

respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate=

standards of conduct:

1. Records -- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate "access" to=

transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file=

room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a=
=20
marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me tha=
t=20
EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function=
=20
for NNG, TW or NBPL.

2. Billing -  FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.  In a recent=
=20
Kinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge=
=20
records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not=
=20
operate separately.  It would be helpful if any EES facility management=20
charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) --  leaving=
=20
us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate=

functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate.

Randy from operations side we wouldn't have a problem operating the system if 
it can be worked out through legal. If it's decided that we will do this 
there might be some additional equipment needed. We can get an operating cost 
together if you would like.
Thanks 
Rich

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Subject: FERC Asks INGAA Members to Brief Staff on Any Critical Winter 
Operations


FERC contacted INGAA to ask that pipelines call Dan Larcamp in the event that 
they experience any curtailments, supply shortages or other critical 
operations situations this winter.  FERC wants to hear from the pipelines and 
have some time to react before they are asked to respond in a public forum 
(particularly Congress).

I have mentioned to you that we included Dow Jones and Public Records to the 
exisiting Westlaw contract ( flat rate remains the same, but more databases 
access) in August.    It took Westlaw Accounting long time to correct Aug. 
and Sept. invoices to reflect the changes.  I apologize for the delay on this

Shelley, these comments look good.  I think they properly set forth  a 
structure to provide for these items as the entire market develops not prior 
to the service availability.  Most importantly, GISB isn't the business 
driver-  others please comment.   Remember,we aren't against its a 
timing/complete evaluation of the impacts to other service that hasn't been 
dealt with.  MK

I agree that we should saya minimum term of five years. The in-service date 
will depend on exactly what mods need to be done which will not be defined 
until Friday or Monday but we need canvass the market now since the timing is 
right. The in-service could hopefully be even earlier.

First,  I thought the inservice was to be earlier than 3rd quarter??  confused
Second, on term I'd suggest we say a minimum of five years, so if someone 
wants to bid for a longer term they can--
Third, in the 3rd paragraph change the reference to term, to as specifed 
above-
Fourth, in the last paragraph, add minimum term of five years again.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC 
adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated 
restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not 
so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement.  
The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of 
the competing settlements.  
I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have 
questions.

Subject: Bad Proposed Decision

Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.  The 
very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both 
settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved 
under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that 
paid off.

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point 
out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, 
when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it 
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of 
making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, 
whatever turns up at the end.

Best,
Jeff

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Subject: Dec. 7 - SDG&E Press Release


CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.

Powergen and LG&E Complete Merger
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Powergen of the United Kingdom and LG&E Energy Corp. of Louisville, Ky.,
have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations. LG&E
will maintain its headquarters in Louisville, which will serve as the=20
headquarters
for Powergen's North American operations. LG&E Energy's utility subsidiarie=
s,
Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company, will continue
as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with=20
headquarters
in Louisville and Lexington, Ky., respectively.

ANALYSIS: Although referred to as a "merger," Powergen actually has acquire=
d
LG&E, a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all
three core sectors of the electric utility business (generation, transmissi=
on
and distribution). Powergen, which generates about 14 percent of the=20
electricity
used in England and Wales, is a company with clear intentions to expand
internationally. The company currently has electric and gas operations
in Europe, India, Asia and Australia. Together, the Powergen / LG&E=20
combination
reportedly will have assets of nearly $14 billion and total revenues of
$9 billion, serving four million customers worldwide.

The partnership marks the third acquisition of a U.S. electric utility
by a foreign company, following ScottishPower's purchase of PacifiCorp
and National Grid's purchase of the New England Electric System (NEES),
both in 1999. It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition
of a U.S. utility, the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have
become easier to pass.

Powergen's reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise
from needs similar to its U.K. counterparts. In the last ten years that
have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of=20
electricity
in the United Kingdom, the electric sector has become completely competitiv=
e
in all areas, including domestic customers. Just as in U.S. deregulation,
concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of U.K.
companies, which is compounded by the limited size of the U.K. energy marke=
t.
Consequently, companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both
in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through
opportunities abroad. Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the
U.S. market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan=
ies
in this country, including Cinergy and Houston Industries (now Reliant),
which all fizzled.

LG&E is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's
desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market. LG&E should
be a good partner for Powergen, as the latter gains access to approximately
3.7 million customers. In addition, LG&E owns equity in and operates=20
non-utility
power plants in six states as well as in Spain; owns interest in three
natural-gas distribution companies in Argentina; and owns CRC-Evans Pipelin=
e
International, a provider of specialty equipment to the natural-gas and
oil pipeline construction industry. Altogether, LG&E's two utilities and
numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in assets, which
should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind.
Perhaps Powergen's primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan=
y
values LG&E's comparatively low-cost power production and high standards
regarding reliability and customer service.

Yesterday (Dec. 11) marked LG&E Energy's last day of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Shareholders on record should receive letters of=20
transmittal
from Powergen's paying agent, Computershare Trust Company of New York,
containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the
agreed-upon cash payment of $24.85 per share. An additional payment of
25.276 per share will also be paid to LG&E Energy shareholders on record
as of Dec. 8.

Powergen reportedly paid about $3.2 billion for LG&E, and assumed an=20
additional
$2.2 billion in LG&E debt. During the merger process, there was a lot of
speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LG&E, despit=
e
its disclosure of divesting key assets=01*such as overseas interests, its
metering business and two U.K. power stations=01*to generate liquid capital=
.
During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition,
Standard & Poor's kept Powergen's debt position under scrutiny, although
its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any
significant downgrades in its ratings. Moving forward, it will be interesti=
ng
to see how the company's rating changes now that the acquisition has been
completed.

We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of U.S. utilities=
=01*
and
all are still fairly new=01*so consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu=
re
of two foreign corporate cultures will work. As an example of difficulties
that Powergen might face, ScottishPower encountered a multitude of=20
difficulties
assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of
PacifiCorp. In addition, although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have
claimed that they intend to become major players in the U.S. markets throug=
h
their acquisitions of U.S. companies, that has yet to materialize.

Where the combined company goes from here is unknown. It is possible that
Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed
that this will be a key area of expansion. Another possible strategy is
developing its telecom business. Powergen announced its move into the U.K.
telecommunications sector earlier this year. Powergen's joint venture with
Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc=
ts
and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with
multi-utility billing solutions. Thus, speculation has been raised that
the company may develop this area of its business in the United States
as well. It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa=
ny
attempts an acquisition of a U.S. utility. Consequently, many eyes will
remain on the Powergen / LGE combination as it should be a good indicator
of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be.

Lon, thanks for including me on the following distribution.  Both Greek Rice 
and I have received phone calls from the Coastal (Great Lakes) corporate 
legal officer informing us of the outcome on the day of the decision.  He 
expects the State to appeal, and we will be watching this very closely.

We have had a series of meetings with the Minn DOR on behalf of NNG, 
discussing not only the compressor fuel issue but the Industrial Processing 
tactic in general, and were on hold by the DOR until this case with Great 
Lakes was decided.  

If you would like to have further details, please let me know and we will be 
gald to furnish them to you.

Thanks again.

As you may recall we have been arguing with the MN Dept. of Revenue for years 
over whether or not natural gas used as a compressor fuel was subject to the 
Minnesota use tax.  Great Lakes has been in court with the DOR over this same 
issue.  Today I received the following, which is an internal memo that was 
circulated in the Dorsey & Whitney law firm, which has been representing 
Great Lakes announcing a favorable ruling.

Who in certificates has looked at the issues of using our compreesor turbines 
to generate electricity??
Also has anyone in Legal done any research on PUHCA issues.
I was just speaking with Bob Burleson and Rod Hayslett about these issues.  
Rod said that Danny is very interested and is considering power generation on 
the Florida system.  Do you know who from legal is on that team?
i assume there may be marketing affiliate isues also ??

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators
 
posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 

Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with 
FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 
922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide 
additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate 
Program, the company said.

"A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor 
stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, 
restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.

Natural-gas Prices Hit Astonishing Highs; Will Coal and Nuclear Benefit?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

According to a Dec. 5 report in the Wall Street Journal, natural-gas prices=
,
which already had been rising all year, shot up 11.4 percent to an all-time
high of $20 per million BTUs on Monday at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Today, reports are circulating that spot prices at the Southern California
border reached an astounding $41 on Wednesday, breaking the Daily Gas Price
Index's all-time record high of $39. The sharp increases are viewed as
a reaction to cold weather in the Northeast and forecasts of more to come.
Projections continue to indicate that natural-gas customers will see sharp
increases in their heating bills very soon. The current increase has result=
ed
from a volatile mixture of rising demand and decreased supplies for natural
gas, which has driven up prices by a total of 218.9 percent, or more than
$5, since a year ago. The uncertain future of natural-gas supplies may
be a contributing factor to an unexpected resurgence of interest in coal-fi=
red
and nuclear power.

ANALYSIS: Unfortunately, we are starting to see real evidence of the projec=
ted
rise in natural-gas prices, just as temperatures start to take their downwa=
rd
slope across most of the United States. Two months ago, the Department
of Energy predicted that households using natural gas would see the largest
year-on-year percentage increase in their bills, with prices rising about
40 percent on average. We've actually been seeing the price increase since
June of this year, when natural-gas hit a then-unprecedented mark of $4.686
per million BTUs. At that time, it was a shock to see those kinds of spikes
for natural gas, especially since the energy source is typically used mostl=
y
in the wintertime for heating. Yet, now as we move into the coldest months
of the season, I project that the all-time-highs of $20 to $40 per million
BTUs are something that might become all too common for the near term.

The Wall Street Journal article on the price spikes also reported that
the American Gas Association estimated that, as of Nov. 24, there were
about 2.502 trillion cubic feet of gas in storage. This represented an
11-percent decrease from the five-year average for that date. The United
States is mostly self-reliant when it comes to natural-gas supplies and,
as I've discussed in previous columns, the fact that a reported 60 percent
of federal lands has been placed off limits for natural-gas drilling certai=
nly
adds to the concern about future supplies. The Clinton administration and
environmental groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands
and prohibited drilling for natural gas (or oil) in states like Alaska,
where some 36 trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground.


Yet, at the same time, substitute forms of power generation, such as coal
and nuclear, have been restricted or downgraded in favor of natural gas,
which has only exacerbated the current demand on supply. EPA standards
have become so pro-natural gas over the last decade that few coal-fired
plants have been built in the last 10-20 years. Certainly, the public=20
resistance
toward nuclear power has been well documented, which has thwarted any plann=
ed
production of a new nuclear plant.

Ironically, it seems to me that we now find ourselves at a crossroads in
this industry that may in fact lead to a resurgence of coal-fired and nucle=
ar
power. Especially in states such as Texas and Oklahoma, which are very
reliant on natural-gas supplies, the current uncertainty about the=20
availability
of natural gas and reasonable prices poses a major dilemma. Despite the
recent trend of moving away from these two forms of power, I can point
to several developments indicating that the current predicament could creat=
e
a forced reliance on these power substitutes.

First, let's look at coal. It's been widely postulated that coal is cheaper
and easier to produce than natural gas, and its supplies are certainly
more abundant. As recently as this year, coal has accounted for about 54
percent of the electricity produced in the United States, although that
majority-hold over power production has come under attack. Emission=20
requirements
have forced many generators to shut down or minimize the use of their=20
coal-fired
generating stations. In fact, a group of seven utilities=01*AEP, Cinergy,
Illinois Power, Southern Indiana Gas & Electric, Southern Company, and
Tampa Electric Company=01*have been hit with a lawsuit by the EPA, claiming
that they contributed to some of the most severe environmental problems
facing certain parts of the United States. Specifically, the EPA has claime=
d
that the utilities violated the Clean Air Act with emissions from their
coal-fired power plants.

Currently, while natural-gas prices have soared, coal prices have remained
comparatively low and stable. In addition, clean coal technologies are
being put into place to reduce the amount of particulates released from
coal-fired plants. As a result, many generating companies are hedging their
bets that the rise in natural gas prices will continue by maintaining or
increasing their coal-fired generation. For example, AEP is the nation's
leading consumer of coal. Reportedly, about 67 percent of AEP's electric
generation is made at coal-fired plants. In response to the natural-gas
price spikes, AEP confirmed that it will continue to operate all of its
coal-fired plants at full capacity, despite the ongoing lawsuit from the
EPA.

Proponents of coal are using the so-called "natural gas crisis" as an=20
opportunity
to argue that electricity from coal can be provided at about half the cost
of other fossil fuels and is less costly and more reliable than intermitten=
t
power sources such as wind and solar. In addition, coal proponents say
that the cost of electricity would double if the United States were to
replace all existing coal-generated power plants with alternative forms
of power.

Nuclear power also could stand to benefit from the comprised supplies and
high prices of natural gas. Following the growing interest among several
European and Asian countries, several U.S. utilities have expressed recent
interest in expanding their nuclear assets. Corbin McNeill, co-head of
Exelon Corp., on Monday stated that new nuclear plants are needed and one
will definitely be built in the next five to 10 years. McNeill also noted
that the question of whether a new nuclear plant was built would depend
on a sustained increase in prices for natural gas, which remains the curren=
t
fuel of choice for new power plants. However, he rejected the notion that
building new nuclear plants would require the Energy Department's Yucca
Mountain spent fuel repository to be operational, an event that probably
won't happen until 2010.

Entergy is another example of a company that continues to aggressively
pursue nuclear power and may spark other companies to do the same in respon=
se
to high natural-gas prices. In late November, Entergy announced that it
would submit a counteroffer for the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, which
is already in the midst of being sold to rival buyer AmerGen Energy (the
joint venture between Exelon and British Energy). Entergy, which has been
developing a strong nuclear platform for some time, believes that the=20
Northeastern
United States offers a strong market potential for nuclear power, and plans
to increase its offer for the Yankee plant and trump AmerGen's standing
offer of $93.8 million.

The next few months, especially as temperatures continue to drop, should
be very telling on two counts. First, will we continue to see the=20
record-breaking
prices for natural gas? (I say yes). Second, what impact will these price
spikes have on coal and nuclear? I think they should only have a positive
impact on future development of these two forms of power. However, the
question is whether or not new production of coal and nuclear can be put
into place fast enough to minimize the potentially disastrous impact from
the low supplies and resultant rising prices of natural gas. Only time
will have the answer to these questions.

NGPL has filed an application requesting approval to sell its interest in 
certain offshore facilities to Green Canyon and is also requesting 
non-jurisdictional status of the subject facilities.  Northern owns an 
undivided interest in certain of the facilities being sold by NGPL.    The 
Commission has issued a data request to Northern regarding its interest in 
the subject offshore facilities.  I just became aware of this data request 
this morning.  

The FERC has requested that Northern provide the following:

"Northern is requested to present formally its views to the Commission on the 
jurisdictional status of its fractional ownership interest in these 
facilities.  These submissions should include specific information regarding 
the current classification of the facilities, for purposes of accounting and 
rate treatment. " 

Because Northern's response is due on Thursday, November 9th, I have taken 
the liberty of drafting a response for your review.  This response is similar 
to Northern's previous responses in other dockets.  Please  provide your 
comments by noon, Wednesday, November 8 as Northern must send its response to 
Washington in overnigth mail for filing on 
Thursday.  Thanks MW

Subject: FERC Data Requests issued 11-6-00 in CP00-369-000 & CP00-379-000


I have sent you this e-mail to inform you that FERC data requests were
issued yesterday, 11-6-00, to  your company (see company name and the
individuals listed below) which require written responses by your company
within 3 days of the date of the data request or by Thursday, 11-9-00 in the
captioned dockets.  As you may recall, in those dockets (a copy of the
applications were originally sent you in which your company also had some
imput), NGPL requested authority to abandon, by sale to Green Canyon Pipe
Line Company, L.L.C. (Green Canyon) and East Breaks Gathering Company,
L.L.C. (East Breaks), certain currently operational and previously abandoned
and retired in place wholly and jointly owned laterals, meter, field
compressors and appurtenances located offshore Louisiana and Texas.  NGPL
also requested that FERC declare these facilities to be nonjurisdictional
upon abandonment and tranfer to Green Canyon and East Breaks.  The above
data requests require your company to submit its views on the jurisdictional
status of your fractional ownership interests in the facilities (of NGPL
also has an interest which NGPL is requesting to abandon in the above
dockets) and request that your submission include specific information
regarding the current classification of the facilities for purposes of
accounting and rate treatment.  I would call your attention Attachment 4 to
the applications in both dockets which show the facilities in question and
the related ownership interests that FERC is referring to.  For your
conveniance I have attached Excel spreadsheets of Attachment 4 to both of
the applications for your review.  The data requests themselves can be
downloaded on CIPS in the captioned dockets (I have attached below for your
convenience the data request sent to Koch as an example as the wording in
these requests is identical except for the company and the addressee --
these requests are in Wordperfect format).  Your attention to these data
requests is greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your help.

AES Corporation announced further international expansion through its=20
acquisition
of KMR Power Corporation ("KMR"), a privately owned electric power plant
developer and operator in Colombia, South America. KMR has controlling
interest in three natural gas-fired power plants having a total capacity
of approximately 600 MW.  AES will be acquiring two of the three natural
gas-fired power plants located in Cartagena  through a 100% interest in
the 314 MW TermoCandelaria power plant and a 62% interest in the 90 MW
Mamonal plant.

ANALYSIS: AES continues its "non-strategy" of acquisitions in the purchase
of KMR. In a recent interview with Dennis Bakke, AES CEO, I asked him sever=

times about AES "strategic plans," to which he answered, "We don't have
(one)."  Ideas often flow from the bottom up in the mega-power company
due to its decentralized structure.  Decisions are made in response to
a unique company mission which is "to serve the world and steward its=20
resources,
making clean, safe, reliable electricity available."

So why venture into Colombia, a hotbed of political and social upheaval
with an uncertain business environment? A risky business by many energy
companies' standards.  But AES has created a dramatic international network
guided not essentially by the almighty dollar, according to Bakke. "We'll
go anywhere we are needed, or wanted, and can live our values and principle=
s."

So, given its unique company policies and experience in South and Central
America, KMR is a prime target. AES is perhaps the most suited to successfu=
lly
penetrate the dictatorial climate of Colombia and spark a change as they
do what they do best =01* buy, command and redirect electric service from
that monopoly into a clean, reliable and democratically supported power
service.

AES has made headlines throughout the year 2000 with its continuing list
of acquisitions and development in countries including Chile, Bolivia,
Argentina, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, England, Tanzania, Venezuela,
Puerto Rico, Brazil, Bulgaria, Republic of Georgia, and most recently,
Oman.

The acquisition of the Venezuelan utility C.A. La Electricidad de Caracas
(EDC) captured the headlines for several months earlier this year. AES
was involved in what was billed as a "hostile takeover," in a process that
intrigued the energy community.

AES purchased approximately 35,529,500 American Depository Shares (ADSs)
- including ADS's subject to guaranteed deliveries, representing approximat=
ely
49% of the outstanding shares. Dennis W. Bakke commended the Comision Nacio=
nal
de Valores, the Venezuelan Securities and Exchange Commission, on its final
action to allow AES to extend its offer after several stressful attempts
to close the deal.  But Bakke said the action would send a strong positive
signal for foreign investment in Venezuela.

"We were hoping to serve that country and we thought we could do a lot
better job than was being done by EDC. We didn't give a second thought
about controversy. We knew this was the right thing to do."

Bakke maintains that Venezuela has been run by a handful of very wealthy
and powerful families for many years. AES has the clout, the money and
the mission to go in, shake things up and, in line with AES' goals,  "to
create a stronger economy, a more competitive society." The strategy in
Colombia appears to continue that focus in South America.

"We've made a lot of changes (in the company) and it's not only going to
change Venezuela, but I think it will make a big difference in the neighbor=
ing
states as well."

Bakke is irrepressibly enthusiastic about the AES mission, although admitti=
ng
that maintaining its lofty principles is a challenge.

"(Our position and principles) seem to always be under attack," said Bakke.
"I know of no other corporation in the world of any significance that sees
its role in the world the way we do. But, our purpose has grown over the
years and actually deepened as we've expanded further and further into
the world."

AES has had another winning year. A world leader in generation, its value
has doubled in the past year,  Generating assets include one hundred and
twenty-five facilities totaling over 44,000 MW of capacity world wide.


Can it continue balancing the tightrope of economic growth and philanthropi=
c
philosophy? So far, AES seems to have been "touched by an angel" in its
endeavors into areas where "others fear to tread."

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. 
Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network," said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. "This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project," said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest," said Macdonald. "We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation." 

Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business 
development, at (630) 691-3347.

Note:  The FERC meeting is today.  See the link below that can be checked for

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes

As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning 
with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, 
free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price 
cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 
AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) 

In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO 
Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural 
problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers 
who have placed "price cap 'band aids' over hemorrhaging wounds." 

Lay told Hoecker the power market is "halfway across a busy street in its 
transition from monopoly to competition. It can't stand where it is." He said 
FERC has to make a choice between falling into the "same trap of political 
expediency as California's ISO, leaving the nation's electric system in the 
lurch from one crisis to the next, [o]r it can take a big step toward 
fundamental structural reform." 

At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) called on FERC 
to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the Cal-ISO from 
"unilaterally implementing" any changes to its current $250/MWh price cap for 
wholesale electricity purchases. In a motion filed Monday, the marketer group 
specifically asked the Commission to bar the Cal-ISO board of directors from 
putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex 
load-differentiated price cap of $100 or less during the off-peak season 
effective Nov. 3. The plan was designed by the state's main utility consumer 
group (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). In addition, the EPSA urged FERC to "state 
explicitly" that the Cal-ISO does not have the authority to impose or extend 
price or bid caps, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission. 
The Cal-ISO's current authority to set price caps expires on Nov. 15. 

Lay said the Cal-ISO's complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of 
gas-fired generation, "making obvious errors such as failing to take into 
account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in 
California; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to 
sell their gas supply, rather than use it to make electricity in California." 
The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc 
basis "to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract 
sufficient supplies (which it inevitably will do)," Lay said. In addition, 
the capped formula "invites generators to shut in production, export power 
out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries." 

He noted that the ISO's Chairman voted against the measure while all of the 
state's utilities voted for it "presumably knowing full well that it simply 
will not work." 

California is "just the latest failure of partial or compromised open 
access," said Lay. "It's time for the Commission to reject this approach. 

"The power industry --- the nation's most essential industry --- is mired in 
the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice. 
Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one 
vested interest or another. As a result, utilities are free to slow the 
interconnection of new generation, withhold equal access to the transmission 
system, favor their own sales over those of competitors, miscalculated 
available transmission capacity, and exercise control over supposedly 
'independent' system operators and reliability organizations. 

Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would 
"plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and 
conservation methods..." 

FERC has to complete the work that it started, said Lay. It has to ensure 
that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by "ending the 
special priority for utility uses of the system. Second, FERC must require 
transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets 
from their other businesses. Third, FERC must take politics out of 
transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure 
independence. Finally, FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps 
by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate 
efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies." 

EPSA said the Cal-ISO board "acted in obvious disregard for the Commission's 
orderly processes." It "cannot be permitted to make the Commission's 
decisions for it, or to alter so radically market rules, thereby injecting 
more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for 
fashioning fair, effective and comprehensive remedies" for California's 
"flawed" electric markets, the group noted. 

The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the 
California markets will be "severely compromised" if the Cal-ISO board's 
imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect.

Based on comments provided and incorporated, I am providing a final(?) copy 
of the review.  I believe that the next step we agreed to is for Mary Kay and 
Drew to provide/discuss this report with Marketing.  Based on project(s) 
status in the weekly reports, this next meeting should be timely.

Yes, I thought was to not take back space in the EOT area since we have some 
available and were not looking to expand there.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

Tom Celentano of FERC Energy Markets (in Scott Miller's group) is collecting 
informal information about the California market.  He has asked Transwestern 
to provide the following information for the gas day of December 7.  He would 
like this data in the next few hours (preferrably via fax 202-208-1010):

Capacity available by segment 
Whether TW had any curtailments, OFOs, or any other limitations or penalties 
in place
Scheduled capacity to the California delivery point by service type
Any nominations which were not confirmed/scheduled at the California delivery 
points
Throughput

Initially he also asked for pricing data -- specifically any information that 
we have about delivered prices at the California border.  Steve Harris and I 
told him that any information we would have on this point would probably be 
hearsay or info. from gas daily or EOL sources.    He said he had access to 
published data & we could drop this part of the request.

Steve January is working on providing items 1-5.

Do you get any reports from Tom Rutherford on New Mexico??

The Supreme Court has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in
Washington, D.C. this Christmas.

This isn't for any religious reason.  They simply have not been able to
find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol.

There was no problem however finding enough asses to fill the stable.




Happy Holidays,

     How is life?  Things here are going very well; just extremely hectic
(which, I guess, comes as no surprise).  I am giving you plenty of advance
notice; we are getting married on Sunday, September 2, the Sunday of Labor Day
weekend in New York. We have scheduled this in part to accomodate our dear
friends from out of town such that they do not have to take the Monday off 
work.
Details to follow, but no excuses!  it has been far too long since I saw you,
and cannot imagine a happier occasion.  I will check in over the next few days
to hear how life is for you, and hope and trust it is all well.  Talk to you
soon, David & Joy

CLE boondoggle out here, but given your practice specialty, it might be

PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources

Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both
companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will
acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western
Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE
subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n
named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, 
Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including
its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into 
Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.

Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated
equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including
conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new
holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western
Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total
enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9
billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's
earnings per share and cash flow.

Vector Pipeline has appointed Craig R. Fishbeck as president of Vector. 
Vector believes that Fishbeck's extensive industry experience and knowledge 
of Vector's market area position him well to lead the company through its 
December 2000 start-up and coming years of growth. The pipeline also believes 
Fishbeck's appointment strengthens Vector's role as a vital link between the 
Chicago Hub and Dawn, Ontario, to help meet the growing demand for natural 
gas in the U.S. Midwest, Eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast. Fishbeck 
comes to Vector from CMS - Panhandle where he held the position of vice 
president, marketing.

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved 
posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full.

              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS

          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     today approved a price cap change requested by the California
     Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.

          The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  

          The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in California.

          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   

          The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.

          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   

          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     California QF.

          The orders are effective immediately.

          To view the Commission orders in full go to "What's New" at
     www.ferc.fed.us.

Attached is the weekly file for TW.   Transport margins decreased due to the 
maintenance outages.  Operations revised volumes to California to be lower 
than last week's estimate.

Please call if you have any questions (53858).

Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft 
form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to 
you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new 
company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes 
to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have

Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20
going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff=
=20
filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that=

2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=
ed=20
to charge market based rates.

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=

of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20
prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20

possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=
=20
system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=
s=20
to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=
n=20
the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

***

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20

Application for declaratory order must include:

As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df

Back by popular demand, here are the current travel alternatives to Shadow 
Ridge C.C., the site of this year's NPNG Holiday Party:


Pacific Street  

There are currently no road projects that would block access to the club's 
main enterance at 187th - this is the recommended route.
    
The work that had Pacific out of commission from 190th to 204th has been 
completed.  However, the intersection at 204th is still somewhat a mess - no 
street lights, no traffic lights, unmarked roads, no street signs, etc.  
Also, Pacific is now closed west of 204th.

Center Street  

Center Street is open.  However, you currently cannot directly access 180th 
Street (North or South) from Center or cross Center on 180th.  

There is an unmarked detour that can get you to from Center to 180th around 
the Lakeside Complex and through the Western Springs subdivision.  But it 
would be difficult to explain on paper how to do it.

You can turn on to 192nd from Center (the Lanoha corner), go North on 192nd 
to Pacific and go East to 187th to get to the club.  But be careful if you 
take this route to go from the club back to Center - turning from 192nd on to 
Center going East can be a problem at times (cars on Center do travel at 
fairly high speeds and they do not expect people to be coming on to Center at 
this location at this time of night).  Watch out for wildlife in this area as 
well.
    
West Dodge Road

Dodge is a mess from 160th to 180th Street.  There are some lane changes in 
this area that can be hard to navigate when it is dark.  Also, there is no 
way to gain access to 168th from Dodge or cross Dodge at 168th.

If you feel up to handling the construction, you can get off of Dodge at 
180th Street.  But be sure to recognize that 180th is an abnormal 
intersection - it is like an interchange without an overpass (going west, 
you'll need to take an unmarked exit lane that goes off to the right at about 
179th, turn on to 180th, and cross Dodge at  the intersection - left turns 
directly off of Dodge are not permitted).

Also, be aware that there is an unmarked deer crossing area that goes from 
about 180th to 186th Street on Dodge and a few blocks South of Dodge at 180th 
- there is a creek that serves as crossing point for such wildlife.  I have 
seen a number of cars that have hit deer in this area.


Bottom line, taking Pacific is the best route.

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Lindy, your example is correct for settling operator imbalances.  If we have 
a payable operator imbalance
and we settle volumetrically, then we get fuel and transport.  But, I thought 
the "netting and trading" in Order 637
was on Shipper imbalances only.  I am not sure what we mean by "no additional 
cost, etc" mentioned below.
I'll call you in the morning (Thursday) to discuss further,  since I am not 
familiar with the PNM protest.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject: Re: TW  

I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

Subject: Re: TW  

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

The Commission accepted and suspended Northern's SLA filing to be effective 
December 1, subject to refund and other conditions, including Northern's 
providing additional documentation.  Specifically, the Commission denied the 
requests for rejection of Northern's filing and request for consolidation 
with Northern's Order No. 637 proceeding.  However, the Commission concluded 
that  Northern's filing lacked adequate documentation and is requesting 
Northern to provide the following documentation within 21 days of the Order:

1.  A narrative explanation and work papers containing detailed calculations 
supporting the derivation of all numerical values included in the attachments 
to its filing, including rates, allocations, load factor calculations and 
billing determinants.

2.  A narrative explanation and all calculations which Northern needs to 
recalculate the rate impact of the return and tax components associated with 
the SLA .

3.  Documentation including commodity prices and accounting entries for both 
the SLA and the cash imbalance mechanism showing how the SLA balance changed 
each month during the 2nd adjustment period (period ending March 31, 2000) as 
a result of activity related to the cash imbalance mechanism and how each 
monthly value of the cash imbalance mechanism was determined. 

The parties have 21 days to comment on Northern's additional data.  The 
Commission anticipates that with such additional documentation, the issues 
raised in this proceeding could be resolved on the merits without the need 
for additional administrative procedures.  The Commission further stated that 
Northern need not provide information related to the SLA balance for the 
period after March 31, 2000.  

I will forward a copy of the Order as soon as I receive it.  thanks, Maria

A perfected (or nearly perfected) ROW may have some merit, especially as ENA 
continues their negotiations to further develop that power plant in 
Albuquerque.  I'll have Jeff call ENA, and without giving anything away, find 
out how their negotiations are progressing.  I wonder to what extent Dennis' 
agreement with the tribe is transferable?

Subject: Pueblo

Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating 
with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the 
plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been 
ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls 
apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it 
related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement 
with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly 
payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the 
ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we 
are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis 
has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I 
told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd 
suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and 
advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF

Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert

*********************************************************

After a warm October, the first cold weather this year
has provided an early warning of what winter could bring
for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the
great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating
markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge
in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound
in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply
and moved the price of gas back above that of residual
fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of
gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow
most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap
extends through the remainder of November, a heavy
early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for
unprecedented high prices through the winter.

Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750
billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record
low heading into the heating season, and even a normal
winter would reduce inventories to a near record or
record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness
places the gas price playing field in the broad
territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf
Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next,
difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance
could come from switching to distillate oil, but low
distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean
that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per
MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely
drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a
combination of some switching to resid in industrial
boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end
users may be required. None of these measures comes
easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed
by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold
weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price
volatility at levels above the price of resid and
extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather
forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects
Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see
Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time
high for December. But even this estimate could prove
low. If the current cold snap extends through early
December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00
per MMBtu range.

Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum
CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a
maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record
low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this
level was reached only through a fortunate combination
of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent
warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is
likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong
way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to
offset warmth early this month, increasing the
withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on
average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of
the past two years. By the end of this month, the US
inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to
350 Bcf.

CERA estimates that normal December weather would
require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf
per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per
day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would
apply consistent pressure in the market through December
and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to
reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996
all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as
inventories remain on this path the pressure does not
end even with the end of winter, as a significant
increase in injections next year would be required for
inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)
by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to
help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the
magnitude required both to offset power generation
demand growth and to allow this increase in storage
injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced
out of the market.

Demand-Keeping Warm
After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong
rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and
forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter
(November through March) was the warmest of the decade,
and there will be a significant rebound in heating
demand in the residential and commercial sectors as
weather returns toward normal this heating season.

Under normal weather conditions,
* Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5
Bcf per day higher than last year's.

* Monthly average heating demand through the winter
would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day
in January.

* December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per
day relative to last December.

Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further
increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to
normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal
scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day
relative to normal weather.

Fuel Switching
With natural gas markets this tight, there is
significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the
market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic
to price in the short run, which leaves industrial
demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the
market. This winter we expect

* all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an
alternative to gas to do so

* a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of
demand for power generation relative to last winter

* industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500
MMcf per day off of gas

* gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil
prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas

For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of
4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf
per day increase in demand relative to November, with
increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel
switching.

Supply-The Rebound
The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage
inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to
rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48
capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the
soaring gas-related rig count.

* The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of
Mexico is related to the combination of

- the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt
discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup
of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf
per day later in 2001

- the response of the shallow water to the strong
late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity

* Other important capacity additions are occurring in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in
2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play
in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in
Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam
play.

* Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New
deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs
are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older
rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining
rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling
companies struggle to round out drilling crews.

Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West
Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies
prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and
triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and
Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is
exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has
contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per
MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in
the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through
February, with significant widening in differentials as
heating loads decline.

Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but
the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance
is delayed once again, this time until December 1.
Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA
estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf
per day. During November that total should climb to 750
MMcf per day, despite the later published start date.
With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound
in midwestern demand relative to November and December
last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant
premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast,
differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to
spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into
the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:
* Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has
brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub
prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East
will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating
demand in the region will keep differentials within
about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects a December average differential of $0.25 per
MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show
significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm
week in the Rockies could still push differentials
toward $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close
to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant
pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads
in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub
differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies
pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin
to average $0.20 per MMBtu.
* Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the
rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub
and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to
trade within a relatively narrow range during the
winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either
east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA
expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per
MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per
MMBtu for December.
* Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are
now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the
onset of the heating season has offset those increased
flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15
per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in
the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the
strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December
differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect
to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub
at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices
$0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of
this increased basis differential is caused by fuel
costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from
the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would
have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at
$5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite
additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast
from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no
additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this
gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000
MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the
capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's
weather be colder than normal, we could see severe
spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000.
These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in
January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and
the extent to which new electric loads are realized.

Canadian Markets-Winter Begins
The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in
western Canada but is only now being felt in the East.
Storage peaked in the West in early October at
approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf
below the five-year average. Even with modest
withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are
still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs.
Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing
levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well
above the five-year average. With the eastward movement
of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin.
This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with
the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada.

The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal
"freeze-up," which bodes well for a longer winter
drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to
reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next
year.

Further Delays for Alliance?
The "commercial" in-service date for Alliance has been
delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of
problems with clearing the line, delays in the
completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant,
the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline
has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up
since September. It is estimated that flows for November
will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the
full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern
Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see
Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per
day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border
and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep
TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year-
over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern
Canada.

High Prices: Strong Pull West
The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also
provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential
has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a
result of this increased pull. For December, the
differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for
a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule
(US$5.10 per MMBtu).

A consideration is being given to a plan which could provide an additional 7 
reserved parking spaces for employees in the Omaha parking garage.  However, 
before we undertake any work or effort to make these spots available, we 
would like to know if there is any interest by employees to obtain a reserved 
parking space ($30/month).

Please respond back via E-mail no later than Friday, November 17.  We will 
evaluate the response and determine whether to implement the new parking plan.

Jeff,
Thank you for the referral of the Citizens Kingman, Arizona project to Enron 
Asset Management Resources (EAMR), the new ETS service company, for further 
development.  We appreciate your willingness to "stay in the loop" with the 
project since you have the relationship with the customer.  

It is not often that we have the opportunity to take over the operation of a 
facility before in-service.  This is a great opportunity to operate assets 
that do not have a long and potentially risky environmental history, so we 
are excited about this opportunity.

This bid proposal is envisioned to be a joint effort between Operations and 
Market Services to:
Identify the functions required to perform the requested services
Price the delivered services
Identify the risks associated with performing the services 
Mitigate and/or price in adequate compensation for the risks

As the project is kicked off, we enter the information gathering stage to 
determine the configuration of the facility and the service requirements.
I have placed a call to Citizens to initiate this effort and will keep you 
informed of developments.

Julia, 
I am assuming that Donna Scott will be the primary contact for this joint 
development and that she will coordinate Market Service's efforts, therefore, 
she is copied on this e-mail.  Let me know if you have any changes to this 
approach.

Thanks Jeff, ETS Operations would be glad to look at these and any other 
"potential" opportunity to operate 3rd party facilities. Don Hawkins is 
heading up the "endless possibilities" for us. I did copy him on this reply, 
Don is based in Houston. 

I 'am currently in Amarillo Texas with the SW Operation Directors and I will 
discuss this with Rich.

THANKS for the partnership.

		 Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Note:  This interview with Jack Crawford of Alliance is probably the best 
information we have gained on the pipeline
operational start up and background information.  Vector may still be "iffy" 
for Dec. 1.  

Fingers Crossed, Alliance, Vector Shoot for Dec. 1
 
Alliance Pipeline informed its shippers yesterday that all debris has been 
cleared from the pipe, all connections are up and running, and that 
commercial service will begin on Dec. 1. Commercial service originally was 
expected to begin on Oct. 1 but was delayed several times because of 
commissioning problems . 

"We've tested all of our connections and we've been flowing volumes [to 
Midwestern LDCs] up to about half [663 MMcf/d] of what the pipeline is 
capable of transporting," said Alliance spokesman Jack Crawford. 

"We are asking our shippers today to provide forecasts to us of what they 
expect to do in the first month. The last time we did this the forecasts we 
got suggested that we'd be running at about 1.325 Bcf on the first day." 

One of the key questions remaining is whether Alliance's main downstream 
supply outlet, the 270-mile Vector Pipeline project, will be ready to go as 
well on Dec. 1. Vector had construction problems because of wet weather and 
also was forced to delay its start-up from Nov. 1.  The pipeline would 
transport 700 MMcf/d of gas initially from Joliet, IL, through Indiana and 
Michigan to Dawn, ON, but would be expanded to 1 Bcf/d next November. 

"The last I heard they were expecting to make [the deadline]," said Crawford. 
"We actually tested our meter with them over the weekend and it's all up and 
running, but that might be a subsequent event if they have a problem. It's 
been a challenge for them to get going, but it looks like they are all ready 
to go." 

A Vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and 
operations appear to be on schedule for Dec. 1 start-up. "Right now everybody 
still feels that Dec. 1 is doable," he said. "You might want to touch base 
again next week and see how it looks, but right now it looks like we're 
getting things pretty well wrapped up. 

"The last place where we've been completing work has been up in the Milford 
and Highland Townships in Oakland County, MI. That's the area just before we 
go in the portion of the pipeline that we're leasing from Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co. As of last Friday, they still hadn't reached that area 
with linepack [gas]." 

Crawford said the Aux Sable liquids plant also is up and running, and 
previous pipeline coordination difficulties have been ironed out. "They are 
still bringing it up to full scale. They are short both volume and heat 
content at the moment and that's by design. The pipeline is flowing at about 
half volume at the moment, and in addition to that we've been running lean 
test gas." 

Farther upstream, Alliance still has one lateral, the Peace River Lateral, 
that will be delayed because of the impact of wet summer weather on 
construction. "It will be up and running perhaps not by Dec. 1 but in a week 
or two. It's an eight and 10-inch line. It's relatively small," he said. 

Once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly, the next steps to be taken 
include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around 
Chicago, including potentially the Guardian, Horizon and Whitecap Energy 
projects. 

"We also looked at a couple of other receipt connections on the upstream 
side," said Crawford. "We've obviously talked about a potential expansion in 
the future, but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply 
additions in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin have not been as brisk as 
we might have thought, probably because of the downturn in the oil price a 
couple of years ago. It's likely that an expansion would be delayed for a 
year or two or even three. 

"The best that I've been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our 
supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to 
three years, and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our 
system will end up coming out of other systems." 

He also mentioned that TransCanada is planning to take some of its capacity 
out of service, including retiring some older compressors and rewheeling 
others, in order to reduce the amount of excess pipeline capacity in the 
Canadian gas market.

Lets talk today, susan.  I need to satisfy myself that this is really one of 
those "shit happens" situations like everyone seems to believe, rather than a 
situation where we may have a cause of action and some $$$ owed to us by 
someone.  DF

The note below was a portion of Terry Galassini's Weekly Report.  I wasn't 
sure if either of you have been a part of the test information.


**Gallup Compressor Station & Mainline Expansion
A field test was completed and initial results indicate a compressor 
efficiency around 80 - 82% which is within Cooper's guarantee.  A not to 
exceed cost of $3 Million was provided to Marketing for station modifications 
to facilitate an incremental mainline (West of Thoreau) firm capacity of 10 
MMcf/d.    Additional work by E&C to fine tune the not to exceed estimate is 
targeted for completion by December 8th.  The mainline expansion potential is 
directly related to Gallup since the discharge pressure must be increased to 
970 psig to achieve an additional 10 MMcf/d on the mainline.  The San Juan 
Lateral firm capacity would remain at 850 MMcf/d.

Why would this be any different from TW operatiing the Blanco line for NW? We 
would need to put together a joint budget between Operations and Market 
Services exactly as we do for NW?

Subject: Citizens request for proposal

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

---------------

Try to attend both meetings....you'll be glad you did!  These meetings will 
be conducted by Captain Herb Evers of the Bellevue Police Department.  Herb 
has a B.A. in Criminal Justice and is a graduate of the F.B.I. National 
Academy.  Are you ready for "SURVIVAL KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WORKPLACE?"  Think 
about it.  Do you know what to do if confronted by an armed assailant?  Do 
you know when most residential burglaries occur?  In a study of 22,000 woman, 
who were victims of an attack, what was it that 2 out of 3 did that allowed 
them to escape?  Where on the human body are the most vulnerable areas of 
pain and compliance?  

These and other highly important life saving factors will be covered in the 
safety meetings.  You will be participating in HANDS ON learning.........how 
to escape from an attack, how to safely leave a room without being 
assaulted.  THIS IS NOT A MARTIAL ARTS CLASS!    The instructions are very 
simple and you will learn easy-to-remember tactics which will be provided to 
KEEP YOU SAFE!

               QUARTERLY SAFETY MEETING   Room #227             2 P.M.

   
Remember to dress casually for the HANDS-ON Meeting on August 22.

P.S.  Should we tell him the "glazed donut" joke?
