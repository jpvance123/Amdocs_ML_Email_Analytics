You are scheduled to be migrated on or about Feb 20.  Two tasks that we need 
you to accomplish before this date are....1. Create your Notes internet 
password and 2. Determine if you have Notes address book groups that need to 
be copied.  Setting your Notes internet password will allow you to see all 
your old notes messages after you are migrated to Windows 2000 (since only 
the last 30 days worth will be carried over to Outlook).  Copying your Notes 
address book groups will allow those groups to be carried over to Windows 
2000 as well.  The migration team will need to visit your desk while you are 
logged in to initiate the group copy.  All your business cards will 
automatically be migrated, so there is no other action required for them.  
 Please reply and let me know when you have accomplished the following:
Create Notes Internet Password Before Migration
1. Go to your Notes Workspace
2. Double click on Enron Address Book
3. Under People search, type in your name, Highlight your name
4. Double click to open


5. Click on Edit Person
6. Scroll down to Internet Password, type in password
7. Click on Save and Close

Do You Have Notes Address Book Groups?

1.  Double-click on your "Address Book on Local" button


2.  Select "Groups" in the left window
3.  If you have any groups in addition to "LocalDomainServers" and 
"OtherDomainServers" then they will need to be copied over. (So let me know 
when you reply to this message) 


IMPORTANT!

Reply back to this message and let me know that you've set your Notes 
Internet password, and also let me know if you have Notes address book groups 
that need to be copied. 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask those too. 
Thanks!

Do you have Conoco's account?  We talked about this last week.  Did you say 
that you were working-on a termination letter on the three Conoco contracts 
and how their ROFR works with our notice of termination of the evergreen?  
They are:

 20747 mainline 10,000/d termination 2/28/02 month to month evergreen
 20748 mainline 10,000/d termination 2/28/02 month to month evergreen
 20835 san juan 20,000/d termination 2/28/02 year to year evergreen

They all can be terminated by either Party with 365 days notice prior to the 
end of the primary term.

Dear Bob,

Good try, but I need more, so I'll help you out.

Term : Initial term of 5 years, with an additional 5 year term at e prime's
election. Notification 6 months before end of contract
Interconnect: On Pressure Control, range from +/- 85,000. Any significant
change in volume to be communicated between two control
 rooms if after hours.
Gas can be transported from West Texas, Central Texas, or Midcontinent Pools
to this TW-Nichols connection.
OBA will allow for +/- 10,000 mmbtu/day, maximum of +/-100,000 mmbtu/d
Imbalance outside of the above will be moved on/off the next business day
Up to 30,000 mmbtu/d can be exchanged from TW-Nichols to other Xcel/Utility
plants on NNG. Transport charges will be same as this
 transport. The TW-NNG exchange volumes will count toward the annual
commitments. Any volumes above this amount will be
 at mutually agreed upon transport charges.
Any volumes above the 10 BCF specified in Bob's brief letter, will be made
at a mutually agreeable demand charge plus fuel if applicable.
Transport fuel is currently at 1.31%, but could change in future years.


Is there storage on TW ???
The JV between NNG and E Prime will not preclude this agreement.

Currently, TW isolates a portion of the Panhandle lateral to force production 
received into the pipe downstream of the P-3 compressor station to physically 
flow north east, to a interconnect with Northern.  The POI's downstream of 
this block valve are removed from the IT template to avoid that an "all 
points" contract is tendered. This would allow the scheduling system to 
accept a nomination from these particular points to an "upstream" point, and 
we currently prohibit this.  

Historically, this gas was isolated to assure it flowed to an interconnect 
that would deliver into a process gas stream on Northern's mainline, for 
ultimate processing at Bushton or CMS's Beaver plant.  When shippers have 
requested that this gas be scheduled to markets other than NNG, (i.e. 
California or Waha) they were told it could not deviate from this 
predetermined path.

CMS has indicated they will no longer flow this gas to TW starting in March 
(volume is from 15,000 to 20,000 mmbut/d at an $0.08 rate), and will instead 
seek a pipeline that will allow them access to the West Texas and California 
markets.  Once this gas is diverted from our pipe it will not return.  

My questions are:

Darrell: Is there an operational reason why this gas can not flow south on 
the Panhandle lateral?  Is there a quality issue?  I recall the gas was 
diverted to NNG for the benefit OneOk and the Buston plant.  The asset sale 
we anticipated with KN never   materialized, and thus our attempt to load the 
buston plant from these facilities is not going to benefit us. 

Susan/Lee:  Can TW discriminate service if there is not a gas quality issue 
that would otherwise shut the gas in as unmerchantable?  We receive gas South 
of the block valve and it is able to flow on the Panhandle lateral to Waha 
and California markets.  The fact that this gas is downstream of a valve we 
closed for the convenience and benefit of NNG and OneOk is the only reason it 
can not flow to other points on TW.  Is this a supportable position if a 
shipper elected to challenge it?

Steve:  Do you think OneOk still expects this valve to be closed?  Would they 
object if it was opened?  If this gas goes to El Paso, it would be lost for 
processing by OneOk anyway.

Could we get together sometime Monday AM between 8:30 and 9:30 to discuss 
this?

Thanks, Bob

E-mail / Voice Mail Retention Policy Change Notice

We have just received notice of a change to the e-mail and voice mail=20
retention policy.  The change will go into effect Friday, December 15, 2000=
.

The greatest impact will be to your "sent mail," which will be retained onl=
y=20
30 days as compared to the current 365 days. =20

As a reminder, you should not use the email system to store important=20
documents.
They should be saved to your network directory which is regularly backed up=
.

However, for 'sent' messages you want to keep longer than 30 days in the=20
email system, you should move the messages from the Sent Mail to a specific=
=20
folder where the messages can be kept 365 days.

The scope of the e-mail retention policy includes all forms of electronic=
=20
mail, for example, Lotus Notes Mail, Internet e-mail, Outlook e-mail, and=
=20
voice mail.

Enron supports a work environment in which information is freely exchanged=
=20
and encourages employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf of Enro=
n=20
to use its computers and related electronic resources in accomplishing thei=
r=20
work.  Computers, systems, and networks and the work products they contain=
=20
are Enron property and subject to Enron review and control.  All Enron=20
employees, contractors, and agents are responsible for using the computing=
=20
resources provided to them by Enron in an appropriate manner.

The revised retention schedule follows:

Message Location    Maximum Retention
Inbox     30 Days

Ranelle,
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner on this.  I do have some questions 
regarding the attached notice.  What is the counter-offer methodology and 
when will we use it vs. FCFS.  Our tariff currently allows us to use the NPV 
methodology and does not state that we can use an alternate methodology.    
We need to rewrite the tariff provision.  Until then, we should definitely 
post the alternate methodology that we plan to use for at least 3 business 
days in advance.  Drew and Susan and I are supposed to meet on this subject 
today.  I will get their thoughts as well.  thanks, Maria

Attached is a draft of what could be added to the TW Website's unsubscribed 
capacity section.  This is similar to what was done for NNG so that if a 
shipper was looking for unsubscribed capacity on our Website, they would also 
know we have capacity available on EOL.  The change also indicates that we 
may be using a different methodology for selling/awarding capacity than we 
have in our tariff.  What do you think?

Subject: TW Expansion

There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the 
close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial 
thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were 
certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction 
is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an 
alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements 
for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are 
executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it 
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. 
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given 
the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to 
sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the 
capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a 
combination of both.  

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options 
(to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or 
whatever number we decide on)
 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly 
this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and 
fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for 
1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve 
Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated 
rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach 
could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking 
our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 
7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be 
a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a 
customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for 
the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options 
of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is 
sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do 
we have in structuring the options?  

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose 
to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to 
be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at 
$.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have 
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we 
can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better 
deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we 
deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by 
offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and 
$.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to 
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.            

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it 
the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, 
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d 
of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want 
option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That 
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand 
first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?  
Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be 
deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may 
be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the 
recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the 
neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective 
nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh. 

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered 
already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are 
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your 
convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out 
and sell this stuff.  DF

Here is the suggested general format for soliciting bids from shippers by 
phone for the Red Rock expansion.  Drew and Mary Kay have discussed this and 
have given the go-ahead to start calling.

 - Bids will be accepted until 5:00, March 2
 - Guidelines for bids that meet the threshold for making our project 
economic are [describe the three "menu" alternatives -- $0.60 at 5 years, etc 
.]
 - Bids will be evaluated based on highest rate.
 - Shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have their bid 
capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary.
 - Bids should include:  1) service request and 2) offer letter stating 
material terms (rate, term, points, quantity).  Offer is binding.  It can 
include a regulatory "out" in case the FERC rejects our filing, but cannot be 
"subject to management approval."

The only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the Nov. 
open season in a timely fashion.  

Previously we discussed allocating tie bids pro rata.  While we believe this 
is acceptable, we would prefer to not announce the tiebreaker methodology so 
far in advance.  Shippers who inquire should simply be told that any ties 
will be broken using a nondiscriminatory method.

Please see me if you have any further questions.  (I have to leave about 9 
for a doctor's appt. but hopefully will not be out too long.)

Michelle - When you get a minute, let's go over the available capacity sheet 
you keep.  We need to reconcile 11/01 and 12/01 as well as remove the Agave 
70,000 from the available capacity and extend the term of the agreement.  
Thanks.

Before you begin trading your EnronOnline products on March 1st ...

  Review the dates on your products.


We are in the process of converting "regular" products to "Tokenized 
Reference Period" Products.

A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as "Day 
Ahead", "Month Ahead", "Month Ahead +1", etc - but this is not what you or 
your customers see.   At midnight every night, the system checks the current 
date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For 
example, if Product #20451 is "Month+1", then on Feb. 28, the Short 
Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show "April1-30".    
However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product 
#20451 to show "May1-31".  Note that the Product number stays the same, but 
the date has automatically updated.

When all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - 
your links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product 
Numbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it 
might look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the 
same Product all the time - only the date changed).

Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your 
life easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new 
Products and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should 
continue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together.

The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have 
Rolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change 
automatically on the 1st day of each new month.  
 
For example:

On Feb. 28, the "Prompt Month" product will be March; but on March 1, it will 
become April, etc.  
On Feb. 28, the "Prompt +1 Month" product will be April; but on March 1, it 
will become May. etc.

To verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a 
specific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st 
tab marked "Product Details."   Your product will be "Tokenized" if it has 
the following applications:

There will be a check mark  in the box after "Lifespan Tokenized?"
The term "Prompt Month" or "Prompt Month +1" will be displayed in the next 
scroll-down box.


If you have any questions about the set-up of your products, please contact 
the following members of the EnronOnline Product Control Group:
Rob Cass x 35491
Kevin Meredith   x 39555
Melba Lozano x 58986
Chris Walker x 37533

Subject: Meeting on Thursday at 2:30 p.m.

I have set up a meeting at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday (in Houston) to discuss a 
few issues between NNG and TW regarding:
 The TW expansion (and how NNG may provide some interconnecting supply and 
transport for this).
 Interconnects with TW/NNG--how we are valuing this capacity....and those 
with El Paso.
 Direct access to Permian Pool pricing---I need to get a better understanding 
of this, and maybe get some ideas from others if there is a way to get 
Permian   Pool access instead of Waha.

Let me know if this time doesn't work for you.  Thanks.

Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard 
with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, 
etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but 
are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They 
also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are 
all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.

Subject: Re: Pogo Interconnect

There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to 
Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The 
middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I 
have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or 
materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that 
they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of 
January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate 
and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks

Subject: Re: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner 
notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also 
the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so 
should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances 
Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we 
will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  
Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, 
flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The 
chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility 
without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just 
want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three 
weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a 
couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good 
gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work 
order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  
Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, 
etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will 
operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still 
possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it

facilities asap.

Subject: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on 
the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded 
like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What 
will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I 
can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a 
chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut 
in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the 
station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and 
also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as 
things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

"The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly," said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. "The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up." 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. "We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now." 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. "We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably," said Exner. "The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not." 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. "We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California."

Shelley,
I'm glad we made the decision to participate in today's drafting session.  
There were only nine of us involved, with Ed Ross, Skip Simmons and Craig 
Chancellor representing the generators, while Byron White, Georgia Carter and 
myself were there to represent the pipelines.  The others were with the 
Alliance.  Ed was his usual self.  He was confidently making the good 
economic case why the pipelines should consider the generator's position and 
how/why the FERC would likely side with them.  Craig tried to frame it 
commercially, and Skip played peacemaker.  Byron and I played a little "good 
cop/bad cop" on behalf of the pipes, with Byron being the bad cop.  

Anyway, sum and substance, I think we'll be more pleased with the next draft 
of this document than what was submitted to us recently.   The first sentence 
was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of the 
parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to 
physical operating considerations.  There emerged a realization that maybe 
two products are being contemplated here:  (1) a product that blocks out a 
period of time for uniform deliveries (say, 8 hours), and (2) a product that 
basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed upon 
block of capacity.  It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less 
valuable than the second, and priced accordingly.  Byron and I argued that 
segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated, and in fact, may be 
physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline.  The generators 
originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights 
were carved up by hour, (ex. an 8 hr. block of 5,000/d could be repackaged as 
two 8 hr. blocks of 2,500/d).  I'm not sure whether we got consensus there or 
not -- we'll have to see the next draft.

The big ticket items (nos. 8, 9) got the most press.  I was troubled by the 
generators' interpretation of both.  In the case of no. 8, the generators 
wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a 
firm service (whether FT, NNS or storage) could, pursuant to the conversion 
formula, remarket their original firm service as NURF.  The generators were 
looking at this provision as "throwing a bone" to existing customers who 
might want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity (ex. 
seasonal) that may not be fully utilized.  Obviously, the predetermined 
conversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines, as well as the whole 
notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (ie. two or more 
different product types).  We pointed out the services were all different, 
and in fact, any combination of those services, conceivably, could be 
repackaged under today's rules and sold as a proxy for NURF.  I believe we 
were successful in taming that language down substantially.  However, be on 
the lookout for the next draft.

Finally, with respect to no. 9, where the generators want receipts considered 
rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF, the generators had an 
intersting slant.  Essentially, Ed was saying that he didn't want the 
pipelines to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines 
were the only ones who could offer NURF.  By requiring the pipelines to 
consider rateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria, then Ed said the 
generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for 
"NURF-like" service.  Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at 
Westar in West Texas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to 
a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable.  
However, he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same 
storage service at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas 
could be adjusted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant (a 
sort of diversion of gas theory), then the pipeline should be operationally 
indifferent to whether it was providing NURF service or a 3rd party was 
providing a NURF-like service.  They just want others to have the ability to 
compete with the pipeline.

Of course, the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be 
the same.  Moreover, accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could 
conceivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on 
(IT, LFT, etc.) as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the 
pipeline's NURF service.  Skip scratched out a more tame version of no. 9, 
and Ed agreed to consider it.  Be on the lookout for what they come up with.

Overall, as I said, I'm glad I was there, as well as the other pipeline 
representatives.  I hope that we were successful in getting the generators 
back on track here.  I'll be interested in seeing how much of our discussion 
today is embodied in the next generator draft.

I told the group they were in trouble on Thursday, as we were sending in the 
"A" team.  Good luck and call if you have any questions.

Subject: Principles for Generator Discussion


This week there are two scheduled pipeline/generator sessions.  Today, the 
generators will be meeting with a small group of pipelines in a drafting 
session.  On Thursday, the third meeting of the larger pipeline/generator 
group is scheduled. 

Last Friday, I faxed you a copy of the latest strawman for a NURF service 
with my comments. I noted that the strawman is moving in the wrong 
direction.  I decided to formalize these thoughts into our own set of 
principles.

Jeff Fawcett will be representing our viewpoint at the drafting session today 
& I will cover the dialogue on Thursday.  Let me know if you have any other 
feedback.  Of course, anyone else is welcome to attend these meetings with 
Jeff or I.

*********************************************************

Western Markets Disconnect
The western energy markets are currently in a pricing
crisis. Power supply shortages and threats of system
blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and
spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy
headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific
corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the
South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during
December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through
the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong
power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage
levels have combined to intensify the demand for
pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity
bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor.
The result is prices that dramatically "disconnected"
from the rest of the North American gas market in a way
that is more typical of Northeast markets during the
winter.

The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as
the demand drivers combined with weakened storage
inventories will maintain price pressure on western
price points throughout the winter. However, the recent
jumps in western gas market differentials-to more than a
$10 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub-should ease
somewhat with a break in the weather. Under any weather
scenario, spikes up into the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu
range will be a feature of winter markets along the West
Coast. On balance, we expect West Coast price
differentials to average at a $4.00-$8.00 per MMBtu
premium through winter. The spring hydroelectric runoff
season should offer the first opportunity for a break in
differentials that could drop back to more typical
levels of less than $1.00 per MMBtu.

Over the long term, increased pipeline capacity and
additional gas supply are needed to break the
vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes.
However, significant new capacity additions are still 12
to 24 months away. In the meantime-particularly this
winter-sustained high and volatile price differentials
and extremely high absolute prices at western points are
likely to draw the increased attention of state
regulators and the FERC, as winter heating demand
exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the
crisis.

Building Up to the Price Spike
The first signs of natural gas price spikes and
disconnects emerged this summer, as sharp year-over-year
increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to
new highs. As pipeline capacity constraints into
California became evident, differentials in Southern
California moved up to a $1.00 per MMBtu premium to the
Henry Hub. These extremely high prices, as well as low
forward spreads, discouraged storage injections through
the summer. As a result, a strong storage position early
in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through
July. In August a lateral on El Paso's southern system
exploded; the accident further limited pipeline capacity
into California for a two-week period. During that time,
the market drew heavily on storage inventories and
further weakened storage positions. As hydroelectric
generation declined through the summer, the price
strength extended into Northern California. Malin, which
had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the
summer, began trading at a $0.50 per MMBtu premium to
the Henry Hub in September. The summer and early fall
market set the stage for continued and more intense
spikes this winter. The following factors are now
driving this market:

* Continuing surges in gas demand. Gas demand levels
have remained high since early summer, driven by higher
overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric
output. Demand levels for the third quarter in the US
West averaged 10.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, up
from 8.7 Bcf per day during the third quarter 1999.
Persistently strong gas-fired generation production
through the fall months diverted gas to power
production, frustrating efforts to fill storage. This
pressure will continue. The year-over-year demand
increases from the power sector will be compounded, as
evidenced in November, by swings upward in residential
and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet
(MMcf) per day. Overall, CERA expects nearly 1.6 Bcf per
day of increased demand in the West this winter, with
the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions
showing 1.2 Bcf per day of increased demand. Key power
sector drivers, including the strong economy, colder
weather, and lower hydroelectric generation, will
continue to push gas-fired generation.

* Pipeline utilization nears capacity. Strong western
demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western
pipes to high levels. Flows from British Columbia into
the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels
since summer, while flows from the Rockies on Northwest
have remained at pipeline capacity. Flows on PGT into
Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity, although
approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess capacity exists
on PGT into California at Malin. Likewise, flows out of
the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently
remained at capacity. The only slack pipeline capacity
remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on
Southwest pipes. During the past few months, these
pipelines have operated at their highest utilization
rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early
last decade. The high utilization of western pipeline
capacity-reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints
that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the
West this summer-leaves very little slack capacity to
provide a relief valve for demand spikes. And that is
exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks
(see Figure 1). Given the level of storage inventories
and expected gas demand, flows on the El Paso and
Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher
flow levels from December through March than they have
averaged through November.

* Deteriorating storage position. At the start of
November California storage inventories held at 154 Bcf,
a full 32 Bcf below the five-year average inventory
level. The strong in-state withdrawals during November
weakened that position to 128 Bcf; the deficit swelled
to 62 Bcf. Inventories in California have never fallen
below 60 Bcf, so deliverability through the end of
winter is likely less than 700 MMcf per day. Storage
inventories in California are so low that utilities'
ability to balance withdrawals from storage with
purchases from demand-sensitive price points is severely
limited. If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid-
December materializes, this effort at balance will be
even further compromised for the remainder of winter
(see Figure 2).

* Short-term contracting. A significant amount of
western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market.
A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline
capacity to spot transactions-in many cases in response
to gas and power industry deregulation-has left the West
much more exposed to spot market volatility. In other
areas of the country, utilities have significant firm
pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the
citygate and/or have forward purchased gas (at previous
and lower prices) for at least some portion of their
winter supplies. As a result, unlike in eastern markets,
a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of
California utilities will be exposed to the current
price spikes.

* No alternatives. A lack of fuel-switching capability
prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas
prices. Power prices continue to move in lockstep with
the increase in gas prices. Not surprisingly, gas prices
pushed the cost of gas-fired generation beyond the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) proposed
price cap of $150 per megawatt-hour, setting the stage
for a reassessment of this price limit. A small and
declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel
capable. Significantly, air emissions restrictions-
already plaguing power markets with much higher
emissions credit costs this year-will make any further
switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California
market highly unlikely this winter. A recent meeting of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which
has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area, concluded
with no relief granted to generators running short of
emissions credits.

Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November
The first cold weather-related demand spike demonstrated
the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability
of the western markets. A cold weather system in mid-
November brought temperatures averaging 47 percent
colder than normal-the temperatures actually averaged 14
percent colder than a normal January week-and provided
the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery
systems on the West Coast. Capacity constraints on
moving gas into California that appeared during the
summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as
heating loads climbed. This core demand compounded the
effects of continued strong demand for gas for power
generation.

The high power demand was the result of the intersection
of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and
a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power
plant outages. Gas demand in the US West during the last
two weeks of November was boosted to approximately 15.5
Bcf per day, driven by heating demand increases of 2.8
Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage-
related demand increases of 1.0 Bcf per day.

These demand spikes caused buyers-already dependent on
the spot market-to bid citygate prices to record high
levels through the last two weeks of November and into
December. Since demand outstripped supply, prices rose
dramatically at all western price points, and flows of
natural gas to western markets increased over high
summer levels. Citygate prices surged beyond $40.00 per
MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $15.00
per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock. Daily spot gas
prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many
western market regions.

West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter
Although the week of November 13 could prove to be the
peak demand week in the West this winter, CERA does not
expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West
Coast any time soon. Storage inventories are so low that
the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage
withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities.
Generators, which already rely heavily on the spot
market for supplies, are faced with a bidding war for
scarce supplies. Colder-than-normal weather would likely
keep West Coast prices in the $20.00-$40.00 per MMBtu
range. More normal weather would allow a slow decline
from current levels of over $20.00 per MMBtu down into
the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu range. However, the storage
situation and underlying demand strength mean that any
return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early
January.

This winter will prove a critical test for western gas
markets, and the end of the heating season will likely
provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in
the West Coast market. As heating loads diminish
significantly in March and storage deliverability is no
longer a critical issue, premiums should retreat back
into the $1.00-$2.00 per MMBtu range. As hydroelectric
generation begins to increase, the pressure could
subside even further, but storage injections during the
spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines
even during the spring.

The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest
The West Coast price pressure is not limited to
California. High demand in the Pacific Northwest (and
more indirectly in California) will keep upward pressure
on prices from Sumas to Stanfield. Northwest pipeline
capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at
the onset of the cold weather and even so can only
provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest. The
combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed
Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are
bidirectional there. The only supply source for the load
centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in
northern Pacific Northwest (such as Seattle) are from
Westcoast at Sumas. The Westcoast mainline from the
producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also
been operating at capacity. The same bidding forces felt
in California have been evident at these western
Canadian price points, pushing Sumas prices into the
$20s per MMBtu. These forces will persist, keeping Sumas
at a premium to AECO over the winter-and in much closer
relationship to California prices.

Customer Response:  Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire
With power plants and gas utilities paying the current
high spot prices, consumers' bills from Vancouver to San
Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity
prices. The gas industry has been preparing for rate
shock this winter, warning regulators and customers
alike. However, the price spikes in the West and the
sustained premiums in western markets move beyond
alarming. Capacity holders are reaping significant
rewards for their investments in capacity positions,
resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from
consumers to capacity holders. Market power and market
gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will
find easy application in their gas market counterpart
(no matter what their merits). Some level of
investigation into the natural gas markets during or
following this challenging winter should be expected. As
has occurred in the power markets, this will now turn
attention to gas purchasing practices, particularly in
California. The likely outcome of this process will be a
shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases
toward a more flexible portfolio approach.

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved 
posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules

-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

Michelle:

The intial agreement Bob presented to EOG was for $10,000, this was to cover 
the cost to refurbishing the existing 6" tap.  The work order was generated 
with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner 
notification letter ASAP.  EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were 
to supply all materials to re-activate this point.   A scope change was 
intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube,  a verbal cost 
estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed.  A third scope change 
raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install 
additional instrumentation.  Operations at this time insisted we add the 
needed equipment to the work order.  The E&C folks then put out the tighter 
cost estimate of $422,000.  This included the following cost revisions:

 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total   $423,000

Call me if you have any questions, PT 3-0667.
