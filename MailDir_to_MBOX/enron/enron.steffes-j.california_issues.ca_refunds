Sent:   Monday, November 26, 2001 3:04 PM 
To:     'EL00-95 Listserv' 
Subject:        Mirant Protected Materials 

As discussed on today's conference call, in an effort to satisfy the Presiding Judge's request to remove the protected status of materials, Mirant proposes the following action concerning exhibits it filed Nov. 6 pursuant to the protective order in the EL00-95 proceeding (namely, MIR-3 and MIR-4) :

Mirant proposes to formally withdraw its submission of the protected versions of Exhibits MIR-3 and MIR-4, leaving the redacted versions of these exhibits as the only versions of MIR-3 and MIR-4 in the record.  As noted on the conference call today, Mirant believes that the limited amount of material redacted from these exhibits (certain PPAs pursuant to which Mirant incurred emissions costs) is not relevant to the issues in this proceeding.

If any party objects to or has concerns about Mirant undertaking such action, please let me know no later than November 28, 2001 at noon, EST.

Thanks much, 

Jeffrey Jakubiak

Subject: CAISO Notice - Underscheduling Penalty and PG&E Bankruptcy
Claims Bar Date


IMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September
5th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in
part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the
underscheduling penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the
underscheduling penalty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are
several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty,
to date the ISO has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing
pursuant to the underscheduling penalty.  It is our expectation that
Scheduling Coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they
schedule, information that is relevant to them.
As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles
transactions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized
nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market
Participants in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of "ISO
Debtors" against "ISO Creditors" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further,
while the ISO may be asked by an "ISO Debtor" to assert such claims in the
PX or PG&E bankruptcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will
decline any such request.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any
Market Participant's claims, whether or not the Market Participant files any
such proofs of claim in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings.
Further, as we have advised in prior Market Notices, all statements,
including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty,
are subject to change.  A number of transactions are currently known to be
the subject of disputes and market reruns.  There are also proceedings
pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and State Courts, the outcomes of which may
affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Market Participant or by the Market
Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anticipate that further disputes and
proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect
the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO will continue to work diligently
to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.  Nonetheless, it is clear
that significant issues may remain unresolved and/or unidentified by the
claims bar date.
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their
respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX
and PG&E.

Judge  Birchman's November 23rd Order sets January 8, 2002 as the hearing date for  202(c) issues. As we discussed during the November 20th phone conference, the  witness for the State Water Contractors, Richard Jones, is not available for  cross examination on January 8th. As we agreed during the phone conference, Mr.  Jones will be available during the December hearing dates for cross examination  on the 202(c) issues.  
 
Since he will be traveling in for the hearings we need to set a date within  the December hearings when the cross examination (if any) will take place.   We suggest that he be available on December 21st, the last day of the  December hearings. If anyone prefers that he be available on a different date,  please advise us by the end of the this week (November 30th) so that travel  plans can be made.

The DC Team (Linda Robertson, Ray Alvarez) attended and reported on today's prehearing conference in the California case.  The schedule has moved back about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to produce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on those revised prices.  Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due until October 26.  In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported that the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order until October 15, 2001.

A revised schedule is attached.  (To see how it has changed, you can toggle Track Changes | Hightlight on Screen on and off)

The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections rather than actual changes to the schedule.  Notably in today's case, Seattle and Tacoma waived all cross on TFG witnesses, including Enron's.

I called a meeting among Linda Robertson, Gary Fergus, Amanda Smith and RA yesterday evening to compare notes on the status of the captioned matters and determine what activities we would need to undertake going forward.  The following matters were discussed:

1.	Refund exposure / netting of purchases and sales
2.	Receivable from ISO related to business conducted in various trade months
3.	Receivable from PX related to business conducted in various trade months
4.	Receivable related to the underscheduling penalty
5.	Receivable related to the negative CTC

1.	Regarding the first matter, Gary reviewed with us the initial numbers on California exposure relating to our sales in the ISO and PX markets, and our purchases in those markets which may potentially be used to offset this exposure.  We discussed the need to update this study in view of the new data recently provided by the ISO in the proceeding.  Gary will work with Charles River to move forward on this.  The new exposure/netting numbers should be available either at the end of this week, or the middle of next week, due to demands on Charles River related to a Monday filing deadline in the Pac NW proceeding.  A "block forward" issue related to our accounting for sales and purchases, and involving the inclusion of price data related to non-physical, swap transactions, will also be analyzed by Charles River to determine its effect on the numbers that are being generated by the ISO and its impact on our refund exposure.  

2.	I shared information related to money owed us by the ISO for business conducted in various trade months, developed with the help of Kit Blair.  This info takes the form of a certification by the chief financial officer of the ISO as to the correctness of various attached information, schedules and invoices generated by ISO and related to these various trade months.  Kit advises as of yesterday that we are owed $42,891,411 by the ISO.

3.	Information was also shared with regard to amounts owed us by the PX for business conducted in various trade months.  This info took the form of an EPMI account summary on PX letterhead and an overview spread sheet (with accompanying backup data) apparently provided by ISO.  The contact person on this matter is Chris Stokley.  I do not have confirmation on an up to date figure yet from Chris, but my prior notes indicate that this receivable is approximately $8MM.

4.	I also shared information on money due us by virtue of the underscheduling penalty mechanism.  Again, Kit Blair provided me this info, which consists of an ISO generated notice and schedule which indicates that EPMI is owed $33,838,246.08

5.	Finally, I shared a spread sheet obtained from Wanda Curry, as to the magnitude of the negative CTC receivable.

The deliverables coming out of the meeting were for Gary and Amanda to take the lead in updating and developing the foregoing items into evidentiary proof/affidavits suitable for use in the proceeding, coordinating with us, Dan Watkiss / Shelby Kelley and the various contacts.  A listing of the contacts to be made and potential affiants/witnesses follows: 

Contact for amounts owed us by ISO- 	Kit Blair, Staff Trading Supt.
Contact for amounts owed us by PX-		Chris Stokley, Associate
Affiant for the info developed above-	Murray O'Neil, Sr. Director Trading Supt.	 
Contact and affiant for negative CTC- 	Wanda Curry, VP Risk Management
Offset of purchases and sales-		Undefined; possibilities- Jan Acton, Seabron Adamson, 							internal person?

I am available for the remainder of the week to help coordinate Gary and Amanda's communication with these contacts.  Alan Comes will be the primary coordinator next week during my absence; although I will be reachable on my cell should the need arise. 

Thanks,  Ray

On  preliminary review of the Draft Proposal,  I wonder whether, if adopted by the Chargeback Complainants and the Participants Committee, it should be submitted to the Commission in the Chargeback Docket, not in Judge Birchman's proceeding under the July 25 Order.  That order limits Judge Birchman to making findings of fact and certifying the record on "(1) the mitigated price in each hour of the refund period; (2) the amount of refunds owed by each supplier according to the prescribed methodology; and (3) the amount currently owed to each supplier (with separate quantities due from each entity by the ISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California." (Mimeo at 42).  If the settlement were submitted in the Chargeback docket, the Commission could refer it to Birchman with appropriate instructions as to how he should treat it when he certifies the record and his findings.  Or FERC could hold the settlement until after Birchman's report.

This brings up timing questions.  The July 25 Order directed the ALJ to certify the record and findings 45 days after receiving the CAISO's hour-by-hour reconstruction of mitigated prices between October 2, 2000 and June 20 2001.  Under Judge Birchman's Order of August 14 establishing a trial schedule (attached), final ISO data won't be submitted until September 17, which pushes the certification and finding date to November 2.   We need to think about how the schedule shown in the attached order impacts the timing and method of bringing the settlement before FERC, assuming that the proposal's  wording and substance are accepted by all Chargeback Complainants and the Official Committee.

I jjust spoke with Michael Kunselman who is putting it together.  He  hopes to have it out in about 2 hours.  Apparently some people are still  debating whether to lift the protection on specific items, so it may be a work  in progress.
>>> Bruce Birchman 12/03/01 03:04PM  >>> 
What is the status of the pleading that you mentioned to me on  November 26 would be filed by the ISO by November 30 listing the material for  which protection is, and is not still claimed?

The September 26, 2001 order had established December 10, 2001 as the date  for  "Simultaneous rebuttal testimony on November 6, 2001 evidentiary  presentations."  On November 6, 2001 several parties had filed responsive  testimony on issues relating to other sources of cost recovery, including NOx  emissions and startup costs
The November 23, 2001 order said these issues will be addressed at the  February hearing on issues 2 and 3. 
This combination left Staff uncertain as to when rebuttal testimony on  these issues is to be filed.  We called Bryan Clark,  Judge  Birchman's  new law clerk, and asked when we are to file rebuttal  testimony.  He checked with Judge Birchman, and said we are to file all  rebuttal testimony on these issues on February 6, 2002.

The California State Parties will endeavor to have a list of issues from  our perspective available soon.  We feel the need to be somewhat cautious  about presuming a question is properly in issue if it has one  supporter.
>>> AckerCal@LLGM.COM  11/07/01 11:58AM  >>>
Just by way of a suggestion to make things a little bit more  organized for Judge Birchman's conference (and to respond to Joanne's inquiry  earlier today), how about if each group (or individual entity not filing as part  of a group) do the following:
1. prepare a one page outline (not a brief;  just an outline) of the issues that group had introduced in its testimony  (identifying the group and the witness for each such issue).  Later (but  not very much later) more details under each outline heading will get filled in  (by you) for the joint stipulation of issues.
2. put it on List Serv by  midday Friday
3. let's assume for this exercise that if you think it's an  issue, it is an issue; we can second guess one another later and refine the list  of issues when we get together.
4. someone who is public spirited can then  merge the lists into one editorially neutral outline.
Just a suggestion  and no response is needed.

Presiding Judge Birchman:

I sent an email out yesterday morning with call-in information for our Tuesday 4pm call, asking for participation by representatives of all potential groups to talk about grouping and the Burbank motion issues.  The call occurred with numerous participants and lasted about 2? hours.

Out of the hundreds of parties in this case, our initial canvassing came up with 12 potential groups, though less than half of those groups plan to file testimony or conduct cross-examination about the generic proxy price calculation issues at this time.  The universe of potential groups comprise the following:

(1) the ISO
(2) the PX
(3) the California Parties (3 state entities and the 3 IOUs).
(4) the Generators
(5) the Marketers
(6) Out-of-State Load-Serving Entities
(7) California Non-Jurisdictional Entities
(8) Net Buyer Out-of-State Non-Jurisdictional Entities
(9) Net Seller Out-of-State Non-Jurisdictional Entities
(10) the Small Generators
(11) Federal Seller Entities (such as BPA)
(12) FERC Trial Staff

In addition, there are certain out-of-state governmental entities, such as state regulators, that take the position they should not be a member of any group, given their unique responsibilities.

We did not, on this call, attempt to reduce this list.  Certain smaller potential groups will be exploring the feasibility of joining a larger group.

We then explored groupings on an issue-by-issue basis, to determine what effect the above grouping approach would have on the conduct of the trial.  We determined that, at this time, and subject to change as the parties analyze data, only a few groups planned to sponsor witnesses or participate in cross-examination on the core generic issue in this case:  Issue 1 regarding the calculation of the proxy price.  Specifically, at this time, that issue will be addressed at trial by the ISO, the California Parties, the Generators, the Marketers and FERC Trial Staff.  In addition, it appears that some groups may seek separate status only for the purpose of filing concise briefs, not to participate during the trial.

We then turned to the related matters involving Issues 2 and 3 and the Burbank Motion, which concern individual amounts owed and owing.  I am authorized to state that Burbank does not request that the Presiding Judge act on or receive answers to its motion at this time.  Consistent with the discussions at the prehearing conference, the Parties will seek to narrow the scope of individualized issues as follows:

First, the ISO will work with parties to reconcile inconsistencies or errors in data reflected in the ISO's recent presentation.  We hope that most if not all such matters, which could be as simple as a transposed set of numbers, can be resolved by the parties.

Second, we are drafting a stipulation that would address individualized issues.  For example, as noted at the prehearing conference, a number of parties believe that many such issues, including settlement and payment disputes, are being, or will be, properly resolved in other forums, such as arbitration under the ISO tariff or the PG&E bankruptcy, and cannot be resolved in this case.  We are seeking to develop an approach that will involve narrow presentations on these issues, perhaps by affidavit, that would require little or no cross-examination, in a way that preserves the rights of the parties to litigate such matters to finality elsewhere.

Our objective in these efforts is to minimize the hearing time and burden involved in resolving any individualized issues, consistent with the current trial schedule.  Obviously, however, at this point in time, when the ISO and PX are still producing data and the parties are just beginning to analyze what already has been produced, no one is in a position to waive any right to raise individualized issues.  We will attempt to further define these matters arising under Issues 2 and 3 as part of our groupings effort, prompted by review of the draft stipulation.

In terms of process, we concluded that given our progress on Tuesday's call, and given (a) the need for individual parties to explore potential changes in groupings and (b) the pending work on the draft stipulation, it would not be productive to have another call on Wednesday.  We tentatively agreed to a call next Tuesday afternoon (rehearing of the Commission's July 25 order is due on Friday and on Monday numerous parties will be filing testimony in the Pacific Northwest hearing).  We hope this will give sufficient time for drafting and review of the stipulation, which will help focus us on the details involved in resolving the "individualized" issues.

We will continue to work on the above matters and would appreciate any input the Presiding Judge might have.

Staff is considering very broad categories (buckets) which  might contain the issues in this proceeding that we might agree to give Judge  Birchman.  Our list is attached.
Also, Judge Birchman will probably ask us about cross  examination times.  If possible, it would be wise to be prepared with a  time estimate, either as a single entity or as a member of a group.  If  that's not possible, if you could prepare a list of witnesses you are not  interested in crossing, that might give him some indication that the December  phase  of the hearing could fit within the allotted  time.

Kit,

Attached is our extraction of the hourly values of "Mitigated Market
Clearing Price" (MMCP) as provided by the ISO on August 15, 2001.  These
values are subject to controversy and challenge, so I do not mean to imply
agreement by sending them to you.  They are simply what the ISO filed along
with their settlement recalculations in August.

Please call me if you have any questions about the files or how to interpret
the FERC order to recalculate settlement amounts.

 <<mmcp_081501.xls>>

Later today, I will be supplying a comparison of these MMCP values with the
market clearing prices (MCP) that apply to transactions in each hour, as
requested by Jim Steffes.  This later exercise is somewhat more
time-consuming, because different values are used for increments and for
decrements.

Here is a snapshot of what is going on right now.  It is unusual.

According to ISO, they owe us $1MM (instead of us owing them $37MM)!!!!!
However, don't take this to the bank since Jan Acton of Charles River Associates believes that the ISO made a significant "coding" (ie mathematical formula) error with respect to uninstructed energy, that is behind most of this shift.  On the conference call held Monday, others also noticed discrepancies in the uninstructed energy category so it is likely the ISO will discover and fix the error.
We suspect there is game playing going on (in addition to errors in the data).  CERS went from having to refund $1.2billion, to zero.  Also, significant increases (unexplained) in neutrality charges have been observed. 
ISO asserts their calculations are correct despite the suspected errors and game playing.  However, they have not taken mitigation into account for "spot OOM" transactions.  The magnitude of this is unknown, but could be very large.  This makes the correctness of their data even more suspect.
Obviously, given the foregoing no one can agree to limit the scope of the proceeding through a stipulation excluding settlement disputes from the proceeding.  The numbers are huge as are the shifts or swings in liability with each iteration of new ISO numbers.
Absent agreement on the stipulation, Judge Birchman is scheduled to hear oral argument and decide the issue tomorrow.
Our main concern will be to keep consideration of issues 2 and 3 (refunds and offsets) together in the procedural schedule.

I am meeting with Dan Watkiss at noon to discuss strategy, and Gary Fergus will also be coming in for the hearing.  Another conference call with the ISO regarding their data will take place at 2PM.  I will follow up with another e-mail so as to keep you posted.

Ray

For the benefit of all concerned and listserv:
Williams testimony was  provided in a jumbled fashion in a large box which contains
(1) a cover letter  to the Secretary that mentions there is being  filed a redacted and unredacted version of Elliot's testimony
(2) the box provided to me has no confidentiality markings on it and simply  sasys Box 1 of 1;
(3) in the box is a CD with a label  that says exhibits to testimony  of Elliot and indicated those materials are protected--the CD was not mentioned  in the transmittal letter, so withut opening it, one does not know its contents;  
(4)also in the box, without any markings, tabbed items 1-21, attached to  that by a rubber band lare enghty spread sheets which on the first sheet  indicvated that sheet is protected, with remaining sheets covering heat  rate data, followed by another tab 17 with items A-F, none of which is labelled  as confidential, and a further rubber banded tabbed items A through  N.
 
None of this material except as noted is labelled confidential and it does  not appear that Eliiott's testimony and the required detailed narrative  sumary  is among the hard copy mmaterial described above.
 
If the Secretary received this pottage, I would be doubtful that its office  understood what is protected and what is not. 
 
Beyond that, the brief summary of the Heintz testimony is inadequate and  needs to be revised since it simply says he describes, explains, etc. without  providing the essence of the material or the material points.
 
In other words, the filing as it was provided to me is haphazard and a mess  and an explanation is in order togetether with proper provision tome of two  tabbed hard copies of any testimony Willimans wishes to sponsor and a clear  delineation of what is protected and what is not.  The same followup should  be made with the Secretary in the event that Williams wishes to comply with the  Protective Order and the Rules of Practice.

I only have a hard copy but I am faxing one to Jim Steffes.  Here is the relevant language.

p. 4:  "The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until DWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should be suspended effective September 1."

There will be no hearing (p.6) "...we are simply implementing a clearly worded statue (sic) that directs the Commission to suspend direct access."

p.7 Findings of Fact
"3.  The right to contract for direct access should be suspended effective September 1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to September 1, 2001."

p. 7, Conclusions of Law
"2. The right to contract for direct access should be suspended effective September 1, 2001, except for written contracts executed prior to September 1, 2001."

Also some rhetoric (p. 6): "This is the time when large customers might be tempted to switch from utility bundled service to energy service providers in order to avoid some of the impact of higher rates ... This is precisely the wrong time to encourage such behavior."

p.5 It also states that it will not address the payment of PX credits -- and has bifurcated the issue from this order.

The Modesto Irrigation District would like to offer the  following issue as an additional issue to the list that Staff has  prepared:
 
1) Is the CAISO's data  for calculating the Mitigated Market Clearing Price in such a form that allows  other Market Participants to determine whether the Mitigated Market Clearing  Price was properly calculated?
 
Thank you for preparing  this list.

Judge Birchman  asked me to send you his list of testimony he has.  (In other words,  if your testimony is not on there, heads up!)  In the interest of full  disclosure, here is our exchange of e-mails.  I sent a separate e-mail  saying that Avista is part of the Competitive Supplier Group that sponsored Dr.  Chicchetti.

As discussed on today's conference call, in an effort to satisfy the Presiding Judge's request to remove the protected status of materials, Mirant proposes the following action concerning exhibits it filed Nov. 6 pursuant to the protective order in the EL00-95 proceeding (namely, MIR-3 and MIR-4) :
Mirant proposes to formally withdraw its submission of the protected versions of Exhibits MIR-3 and MIR-4, leaving the redacted versions of these exhibits as the only versions of MIR-3 and MIR-4 in the record.  As noted on the conference call today, Mirant believes that the limited amount of material redacted from these exhibits (certain PPAs pursuant to which Mirant incurred emissions costs) is not relevant to the issues in this proceeding.
If any party objects to or has concerns about Mirant undertaking such action, please let me know no later than November 28, 2001 at noon, EST.
Thanks much,

I am attaching the latest draft of the captioned stipulation which I received from Rick Roberts, counsel for ISO.  As you are aware, the stipulation is the next item to attend to in the CA proceeding, given that Judge Birchman gave us a week from last Wednesday to agree on the text of the stipulation.  The Judge considers it important to limit the scope of the proceeding to only those matters that should be before him.  Therefore, in the absence of agreement, he will hear oral argument on the morning of 9/17 and decide the matter for himself.  

The current draft is pretty well down the road between the ISO and generators.  Although the draft appears to be "harmless", dealing with "settlement disputes", it has the purpose of limiting the scope of the proceeding.  I was therefore concerned with the vagueness of it and the possibility it could be interpreted in such a way as to limit our ability to bring offsetting claims in conjunction with the "Finding 3" that the Judge must make in the proceeding.  My concern is that almost anything could be couched in terms of a "settlement dispute".  My fears were confirmed when I talked to Rick Roberts and asked him how he interpreted the language.  Roberts sees it as excluding from the proceeding, 3 types of disputes:

1.	disputes under the ISO and PX tariffs, whether already resolved, unresolved or not yet raised
2.	disputes pending resolution before the Commission
3.	disputes ongoing over existing orders issued by the Commission

I consider this a pretty broad interpretation, but that's how he sees it nonetheless.  Roberts gave as an example of what would be out of the proceeding, pursuant to the draft, the "$150 breakpoint" issue.  I don't have a problem with the breakpoint issue being excluded since the Judge already ruled that it should be "out".  However, if this is Roberts' interpretation, then the problem is that he would also likely consider the ISO underscheduling penalty to be pending before, or not finally resolved by, the Commission.  This interpretation would foreclose our ability to bring, in the CA refund proceeding, the offset for amounts due us under the underscheduling penalty.  It would relegate us to chasing our money in a different proceeding.  This would be unacceptable.  What other possible offsets could he try to interpret out of the proceeding?

I am writing this to raise the "red flag" as to this important issue.  Dan, we will need your immediate attention and input on drafting/negotiating this stipulation.  I would expect that conference calls could be called as early as today, given that there are only 5 days left to agree the text of the stipulation.  I am available to discuss this today or over the weekend on my cell.  Thanks.  Ray

Vernon had understood that issues of costs (other than emissions and
start-up) offsetting refunds claimed to be due as a result of the
application of the MMCP came within Issues II/III and that testimony
from intervenors on these issues would be due along with other Issue
II/III issues on January 25, 2002.  Thus, Vernon did not file testimony
on these issues on November 8.  And, thus, Vernon cannot agree that such
issues are ripe for consideration in the Issue I part of the proceeding.

The below language suggested by Mr. Rosenberg, standing alone, too
ambiguous and vague to Vernon to go into an order setting the procedural
schedule.

Thus, Vernon suggests that the narrative describing the testimony to be
filed on or before January 25 better elaborate on what that testimony is
to address, e.g.:

"Participants' simultaneous responsive testimony on issues  2 and 3,
including APX evidence, [and evidence concerning any  offsetting costs
(other than emission allowances and fuel start-up costs)], and narrative
summaries of  material points, including page and line references
thereto."

Or whatever language makes the point clear.

As a follow-up to conversations with the ISO, we propose the addition of
the following language to address our interests:

To the extent that evidence concerning any other additional sources of
cost recovery (other than emission allowances and fuel start-up costs)
is not considered in Phase I, it shall be submitted and considered in
Phase II.

It would fit as an addition or footnote to the December 10, 2001 entry.

Bob & Ray --

Can each of you please put together a short outline of the (a) timeline, (b) key decision points, and (c) potential outcomes of the decision points for the different refund cases?

If possible, having this before today's call would be helpful (but I realize that this may be difficult).

Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5



If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

Steve,  

Jim Steffes called me to inquire as to the information you are interested in, regarding the California refund case, and I passed the following along to him by phone:


Status of the refund claim:  

The CAISO refund claims made in CAISO letters to Congress, and the final claim at the FERC-ordered settlement conference, were approximately $38 MM.  The initial claim in the California Refund case before Judge Birchman was very similar, although the most recent CAISO claim is that they owe us $1MM!  A review of their claim revealed errors.  I asked Charles River Associates to re-run the numbers correcting only the errors and they came up with a $57MM figure.  Please note that this number resulted from an internal exercise and is not a claim by the ISO.  However, I consider this the maximum exposure from what is known at this time.  I expect that CAISO will revise its claim against us around December 7, and I will communicate the new claim as soon as I receive it.


Points summarizing the proceeding:

The California refund proceeding at FERC, unlike the Pacific Northwest proceeding, contemplates that refunds will be paid and orders the Judge to determine the amount of the refunds.
Issues to be decided by the Judge include (1) the amounts of the mitigated market claiming price (2) the amounts owed by each seller and (3) the amount that a seller may offset against its refund obligation.
This proceeding has been delayed due to errors and omissions in the California ISO's data.
Due to deficiencies in the data, it is also difficult to assess potential exposure. The California ISO's claims have thus far been erroneous.
Hearings are scheduled to occur on December 17-21 and February 11-15. The Judge's ruling is expected on March 8, 2002. 

Timing of the FERC Order:
It is difficult to say how quickly the Commission may rule after receiving the Judge's certification of findings and record on March 8.  Arguably, they could act very quickly due to the limited scope of the proceeding and the fact that the Judge's findings will likely be limited to the three issues described above.

Let me know if you need any more information.  I will copy you on significant memos in the case.  Regards,  Ray

Attached are files that compare the ISO's calculation of Mitigated Market
Clearing Price (MMCP) against various prices that prevail and are used in
the California market.

The attached tables give monthly values for peak and off peak periods (using
6X16 to define peak).  They show percent changes and absolute dollar values
("Margin").

As you can see, the price reductions (that is original price minus mitigated
price as a percent of original price) amount to 50% in some cases.

The margins and percent reductions vary importantly by time period and the
type of charge involved.

I hope that these are useful.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Before I started  having my on e-mail problems today, I told Robert Rosenberg of Slover & Loftus ((202) 347-7170; rdr@sloverandloftus.com ) that I would  see if I could successfully distribute his Wednesday Nov. 21 message and  attachments through the EL00-95 listserv.  Thus, I am giving it a  try.
 
However, as I look  at the attachments, one is 13 plus megs.  I will send that one  separately.  I might guess that it size is a problem, except that many  large files have made it through previously.  The file that is coming  separately is named "1121trl.pdf".
 
Below  is the text of his original message.  Attached are attachments hi provided  me separately, but which were supposed to go with that message.   Thanks,

Please address this with the Listserv participants.
 
Hearing on 12/20 probably should be avoided because of distractions likely  to intrude in the sound system from a holiday party at the Commission which  I have just learned will involve all offices and most  floors.   Rather than keep witnesses over until 12/21 and have a  day of hearing on that day, and as we will be in hearing on 202(c) issues on  1/8, I would offer the following suggestion:.  
 
Hold 3 days of hearing on issue  #1 on 12/17, 18, 19, as  planned,  reschedule the hearings  for 12/20 and 12/21 to 1/3,  1/4, and /or 1/7, and  then hear the 202(c) issues, as planned, on  1/8.  Initial and reply brief dates of 1/15 and 1/22 would remain  unchanged, as would the remainder of the trial schedule.
 
I am open to other suggestions and would like to retain as much as possible  the bifurcated trial schedule process.

This may be a repeat email for some of you, but I wanted to make sure that I got everyone.

As we expected, Judge Birchman has ordered the participants to proceed in groups.  A California Marketers Group seems logical.  Please take a look at the other individuals receiving this email to see if we have missed anyone
that should be included in a California marketers only group.  Feel free to
forward the email on as necessary.

We will plan to have a conference call on Thursday to discuss issues,
including a proposed joint statement of issues, lead counsel, joint
witnesses and discovery issues.  A status report on the group should be
filed with the judge on Friday.

Regards,
Shelby Kelley
