Roughly speaking if you use absorption chilling, you would save (at max 
summer conditions) maybe 1.2 MW per LM or about 2.5% on capacity which would 
be nominally a 2.5% improvement in heat rate. To get this you need a source 
of steam. For Lowell, we possibly could get steam from UAE (I don't know how 
the transaction would work). We would need about 180,000 lb/hr of steam at 
least at 15 psig. The chillers would cost about $400,000 total more than the 
mechanicals we have discussed.

If UAE can't supply the steam, then we would need small HRSG's behind each 
CTG and would most likely also try and steam injection for NOx control. Heat 
rate would improve by maybe 6-7%, plant net output would increase by maybe 2 
MW per LM. Capital cost would grow by maybe $8,000,000 (this is wild guess, 
we did get HRSG quotes for this steam injection/absorption version but have 
not done a detailed capex).

Thomas,

Ben and I had a meeting with Don on Tuesday. Please see below for the summary 
of meeting:

ENA would sell to an IPP (AES or Calpine) a combination of EES short position 
and peaking turbines.

ENA would generate profit from;
 1. spread between buying power from the IPP and selling it to EES at premium 
- will be very thin
 2. having a call option on the peaking plant for the portion of excess 
capacity of the plant
 3. fees from EES or/and IPP for providing/arranging capacity/off-taker
 4. better project financing by leveraging up more and having lower debt 
cost, which would be possible by having off-taker (EES) - Not quite sure yet.

Next steps/Assumptions;
 1. Assume equity IRR of 12% after tax
 2. Match assets to EES load curve
 3. Dispatch assets into market when not to meet load @ENA curve ("RevenueM")
 4. Calculate transfer price to meet load ("RevenueL") to meet equity return 
objectives of 12%
 5. Compare "RevenueL" to EES's market position
 6. Find Scaler value (option value from volatility)
 7. Calculate book earning for bid package
 --> We try to have work of 1 to 4 done by Thursday (2/24). Next meeting with 
Don is scheduled on Thursday.

Regarding our starting point of NY East, EES has short position ranging from 
0 MW to 126 MW in NY East region for next 11 years. I attached Excel file 
which shows an analysis of NY East including load graph.

To read EES data correctly, see the below definition.
 - WD: weekdays, WE: weekends.
 - Each 4 hour block number shows average load for 4 hour block, so actual 
peak load is higher than that.

Idea of sharing data with East Coast Power: Don does not mind if we 
distribute EES data internally within Enron, but he does not want data to go 
to Elpaso. He does not know Brad Alford.

Ben,

Another issue I have in my mind is how we handle revenue after 3 and 5 years. 
Since Calpine will have only 3 or 5 year tolling agreement, it is appropriate 
to assume Calpine's revenue will come purely from market. Therefore, we may 
just need one line of revenue, rather than breaking into capacity payment and 
energy payment. Let's talk to Scott when he gets back to Houston.

Assume an 8% cost of money(taxable) and 25 year amortizaton schedule per our
Financial people. Assume also that we will need to include
a bond reserve fund of equal to one years P and I  plus about 1.5% financing
costs.  The latter two simulates the cost of taxexempt financing requirements.
which we are assuming taxable will be in the same ballpark of requirements.

Again the $545 does not include an SCR. When we got our PSD permit for our
Rokeby 3 unit, the informal quotes we got for that unit were in the
  1.6 to 2.0  Million  dollar range. In the end, we proved to EPA that the
addition  was not  cost effective by some convoluted economic analysis
they made us go thru. However it became very obvious to us, this is their next
regulatory objective. We were so convinced that our Rokeby3
was going  to need an SCR we had internally resigned ourselves to that
unpleasant assumption.
We would assume a 45mw unit's cost would be about 2/3 the cost of this larger
unit 90MW machine ie Rokeby 3..

Rich,

In working through our analysis for the revised proposal to Lincoln, I had the
following questions:

1.  In Lincoln's cost estimate of $545/kw, did this include SCR's?

2. Under taxable financing, what interest rate and repayment period would
Lincoln normally find acceptable?


Any input you could provide would be appreciated.


Thanks

My thoughts on the Central Iowa Power Cooperative RFP

Let me know what you think

1.  We will develop two GE 7 EA's.  Unit 1 operational 5/1/01.  Unit 2 
operational 5/1/02

2.  We will use the Ogden/Boone County Site being secured by John Moore.  The 
site is 1/4 mile from Northern Natural Gas Mainline.  Also, Ameren 345 Kv and 
Alliant 115Kv line onsite.  Assume interconnects to both of these systems.  
Please break out cost for each.

3.  Assume no fuel oil back-up

4.  Assume no black start

5.  Design the units to be later converted to combined cycle.

6.  Assume water injection for nox control.

7.  Assume portable de-min water facilities

8.  Assume Enron does EPC

9.  Assume CIPCO will finance and own the plant  through ther term of the PSA 
and thereafter

10.  Assume CIPCO will execute a power sales agreement (PSA) with Enron from 
5/1/01 through 10/31/07

I talked to Tom Swank today on the Synthetic Combined Cycle. Tom wants to 
have the capacity payment numbers based off of mid and bid curve as well as 
offer curve for indicative proposal to Aquila. Carl told me that you already

Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
"preliminary answer" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, 
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at 
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot 
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, 
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described 
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

Hi Benjamin,

Winston Cheng asked me to forward to you the attached schedule of development 
projects for the west.  Note that these projects are not firm - for example, 
most have not got firm site commitments etc.  No doubt, many of the projects 
are expected to fall through or be terminated for one reason or another.

Cheers

Christian

Clement,

We need to feed the VOM and HR from your model into the calculations page of 
my model.  I am currently linking my model into the model you sent me on the 
seventh.

Don,

We got curves and spread option value from Structuring. Ben and I are 
finalising the first model based on following valuation method;

Valuation of Retail Short =
+ 1. Revenue from serving load (to get 12% IRR)
+  2. Expense from serving load at the market
+ 3. Spread option value for full capacity
+ 4. ICAP ($1.00/kw-mo for first 6 months)
- 5. Fixed expenses

Someone may think #2 (Expense from serving load at the market) is redundant, 
which maybe true, but I still think it is not double counting.

#1, 2, and 3 can be written as follows: (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + Max[(Pmkt - MC), 
0]*Capa, where Pees is Energy price charged to EES, Pmkt is Market price of 
power, Lees is EES load, MC is Marginal cost of peaker, and Capa is Capacity 
of peaker. Therefore,

If (Pmkt - MC) < 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees,
If (Pmkt - MC) > 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Capa, 
   (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - Pmkt + Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees).  

This correctly shows our structure, I think. I will try to talk to you today 
after we finish model. Thank you.

Subject: Calpine update/status

Scott,

Here is a Calpine update. 

Deal summary:
 - ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
 - Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
 - ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
 - Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA bid curve.

Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from Scot Chambers.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, heat rate, gas curve, dispatch, and location 
of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

While we are waiting for VOM from Scot Chambers, we will use VOM number from 
other LM-6000 deal (please see attached email sent to Structuring group by 
Ben). As soon as we hear from Structuring group, I will give you indicative 
numbers. Sorry for the delay. Thank you.

Jinsung Myung
(Ext: 37330)

PS: If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not sure 
what exactly this is for.

For those of you who might be working on LM6000 transactions, there is a 
rough cut of a standardized Financial Model and a old Capital Cost 
Configuration Model that you can use for current/future LM6000 projects. Both 
of them are saved as read-only at o:/naes/from_ko_LM6000/control. If you do 
not have access, please compose a Security Request via Lotus Notes.

Please note that there are still work to be done on both models. If you are 
assigned with any LM6000 models, please keep me in the loop, and I can fill 
you in on the model progress and process. 

Thanks.

Hey Clement & Ben, got your calls -- sorry haven't returned them yet, but I'm 
swamped this week --> LM6000 marathon-o-rama. How's tomorrow afternoon 
sometime 3-5pm? If there are no rooms available in EB, I can probably get one 
over here in 3AC fairly easily. We can review both estimates if you like. Let 
me know if this works for you all.

Please review and lets discuss Monday (I am off tomorrow).  I have a rough
consensus on this but I am waiting to circulate it following our discussion.

Check out the new item on gas imbalance risk and see if it works.  I did not 
go
to 5.5 years (through 2006), but that would help our case.  Also I tried to
quantify the capital I want to have at risk at the end of the 4.5 year toll.
Hope this helps you evaluate other alternatives.

If you have comments tomorrow I'll review them over the weekend and make
changes.  Thanks.

NOTE:  We also need to know if you are going to move ahead on Ameren.  Your
comments to date on size make me think Enron is 50/50.  Please let me know 
asap.

Ben

Attached is a short form estimate I had on Pittsburg which is a 2 X 1 GE7FA 
plant. Also included is Linden 6 (which is a 7FA with an HRSG supplying steam 
to an existing facility, i.e. no steam turbine). Pittsburg is an outdoor 
plant so should represent a fairly competitive deal.



I also have some place a 1 X 1 that we just got on Coyote Springs.

The power option premium pricing was done on 30 MW's, apparently a standard 
product amount. What is the effect on pricing, if any,  for the actual 730 
MW's? Or do we just take 24 of the 30 MW products?
Have we priced the 60/40 split scenario where we can call on the plant 25% of 
the year (effectectively it is a 25 capacity factor), at our option as to 
when we call? We would assume that we'd exercise this in periods/months when 
prices are highest.
For the scenario where the summer hourly power call on-peak is $85 and the 
off-peak summer power call is $25, I came up with a daily, summer-only, 
blended on and off-peak gas call of $7.64/MMBtu. Gas would be at 
index/floating in the winter. The premium for this summer gas call was 
$38,128/month. Bruce, does that seem within the right range?
AES said they need 2 1/2 times more value than the $850,000/month they'd have 
recieved under our initial proposed power premum. Ben is running the model to 
give us a check as to their debt service and FOM costs.

Ben, Bruce, what else do you have outstanding that needs to be run?

Thanks,

Michelle

Don,

Here is a couple of updates on Retail Short. 

- I realized that power curve has impact on both expense from serving EES 
load and spread option value, so I asked Carl to run spread option model with 
different mid curve scenarios as well as correlation.

- To make our analysis easier, I would like to have 40/60 of debt/equity and 
1.5 of DSCR (as you originally suggested), so that we can concentrate on 
"Energy charge" to EES.

Please let me know, if you have any concern. We should be able to finish by 
today. Thank you.

I spoke with Rochester this morning and they advised that they will present a 
recommendation to their Board on 3/28 as to the party they will negotiate 
with.

At this point, they are evaluating the bids and will be issuing questions, 
etc. (Note: 2 parties were disqualified for failure to submit bid bonds)

Again, even though we were low bidder, I would not view this as a given that 
we will be the final party.

I'll stay close to this and keep everyone advised.

Don,

As we discussed last Friday, I prepared some analyses as follows:

If I correctly read your idea, ENA would sell to an IPP a combination of EES 
short position and peaking turbines.
ENA would make money from;
 1. spread between buying power from the IPP and selling it to EES at premium
 2. fees from EES or/and IPP for providing/arranging capacity/off-taker
 3. better project financing by leveraging up more and having lower debt 
cost, which would be possible by having off-taker (EES)

Regarding our starting point of NY East, EES has short position ranging from 
0 MW to 126 MW in NY East region for next 11 years. I attached Excel file 
which shows an analysis of NY East including load graph.
To read EES data correctly, see the below definition.
 - WD: weekdays, WE: weekends.
 - Each 4 hour block number shows average load for 4 hour block, so actual 
peak load is higher than that.

Please correct me, if I am wrong. See you at 4:00. Thank you.

Ben,
Here is a real quick estimate on the info you gave me on this "Synthetic CC 
Plant".  Consider the error to be about +-25% with this quick a turn around.
I will be on vacation next week, if you can wait for the next go around until 
I return on the 15 May, your welcome to call Scot Chambers at 68371.
Regards,
Rich

Scott,

Here is a Calpine update. 

Deal summary:
 - ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
 - Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
 - ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
 - Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA bid curve.

Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from Scot Chambers.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, heat rate, gas curve, dispatch, and location 
of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

While we are waiting for VOM from Scot Chambers, we will use VOM number from 
other LM-6000 deal (please see attached email sent to Structuring group by 
Ben). As soon as we hear from Structuring group, I will give you indicative 
numbers. Sorry for the delay. Thank you.

Jinsung Myung
(Ext: 37330)

PS: If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not sure 
what exactly this is for.

Ben:

Thomas Suffield has determined, through discussions with our accounting 
group, the project cost methodology used for our Genco assets. Unless there 
is a compelling reason, we need to conform your Florida model to this model 
as (i) it is already an accepted methodology used by the organization, (ii) 
it is used as the basis upon which we determine accrual income for our 
existing merchant portfolio, and (iii) it will result in more favorable cost 
profile in terms of $/kW month than other methodologies.

Please let me know if you have any issues relative to this approach. If not, 
please adjust the Florida model and provide me with the results which Mike 
and I need to present to Delainey on Friday. It would also be helpful to have 
the bid and ask from the desk (5 yr. term) for this presentation. Lastly, 
FYI, we have released ICF Kaiser to prepare a forecast specific to the LM6000 
configuration (6x and w/wo a 74.9mW steam turbine), which we can then use to 
compare to the forecasted cost basis of your model.

Thanks,

Ben

Ben:  Because of the short time frame I am just forwarding the questions from 
our broker (representing the surety) concerning your request for bid bond.   
Very valid questions and also will impact your performance bond should you 
win and need one.  Please try and get back to me asap as this is a very short 
time frame for the bond.  Thanks.

Teddy-We are preparing the bid bond based on the request received yesterday 
evening.  The bid specifications indicate liquidated damages in the amount of 
$2,375,000 PER DAY.  I assume Enron will not accept damages at this level.  
Please check to determine if the bid will be qualified in this area-and what 
alternative damages may be offered.  Due to the unusual size of the penalty 
relative to the contract value, this could have an impact on reinsurance.

The contract indicates a normal one year warrenty from the contractor.  The 
charge for this warrenty is included in our standard performance bond rate.  
I have bonded a number of generator contracts similar to this, and frequently 
there is an option for the contractor to offer an extended warrenty up to 5 
years.  Since this would impact the premium charged, you may want to check to 
see if this option exist so we can get the pricing correct in your estimate.

Thanks.

Ben, 
Following up with our conversation earlier in the week regarding changes to 
the LM6000 model, I had tried speaking with Clement before he left for Asia 
but nothing materialized.  George and myself would like to have the model in 
suitable form with these chages (I have attached the file) in working shape 
quickly, ideally no later than the end of next week.  I am more than willing 
to help you with this in any way - especially explaining our proposed changes.

Why don't you review the changes and I'll drop by tomorrow to discuss a 
timeline.

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to "charge" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot

Ben,

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS


Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d

Ben, please find attached revision one to the UAE - Lowell, Massachusetts 
LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility, which is to be located at an existing, 
staffed cogen facility. 

The revisions are due to the following changes in assumptions:
1. Increased annual maintenance costs due to going from 4 to 5 LM6000PC 
Enhanced Sprints units being installed. This increases the CO + SCR units, 
compression capacity and the chiller capacity. Some consumables increase as 
well (test gases for CEMS, oils, greases, etc)
2. Chemical costs increased due to NOx emissions limit from 5 ppm to 2.5 ppm. 
Amount of aqueous ammonia changed from 46 lbs/hr to 76 lbs/hr (per Peerless, 
Inc. quote - they package the CO + SCR system using 19% solution, which keeps 
operator below EPA RMP threshold of 20%)
3. Reduced the staffing costs due to no allocation of labor being assumed 
from existing plant to peaking plant (per your discussion with UAE). Two O&M 
tech staff adds are shown to cover the peaking operation only.
4. Chemical costs increased due to more throughput required. Assuming a RO + 
mixed beds installation per Bruce Golden.
5. Increase in O&M Fee from $80M/yr to $100M/yr due to scope increase.
6. Major Maintenance dollar value increased in absolute terms due to adding 
one more GTG (fyi, $/fired hr stays the same).



Please call if you have questions or want to discuss further.

regards, Scot

Thomas,

Here is a quick update for Calpine project.

1. Ben and I had a meeting with Scott this morning. Basic idea is to have 3 
and 5 year tolling agreement with Calpine and sell to the market after the 
expiration of the  agreement.

2. Ben prepared a preliminary model. Scott's target unlevered equity IRR is 
8.5% ~ 9%. Key value driver will be a capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 or 
5 years, which we will charge to Calpine. As soon as we get VOM from EE&CC, 
we will ask Structuring group to get the capacity payment for 3 and 5 years.

3. Things to be done
 - 3 and 5 year capacity payment to get 8.5% ~ 9% IRR of unlevered equity
 - 20 year power curve (capacity and energy) for Eastern PJM. We got gas 
curve.
 - VOM

I think this idea could be good if Calpine is willing to pay more than what 
we see for next 3 or 5 year Eastern PJM pool price, and/or we can leverage up 
more by taking advantage of 3 or 5 year tolling agreement. This is just my 
thought. Please correct me, if I am wrong. I will continue to work on the 
model with Ben and I will talk to Scott to find out more. Thank you.

To all

rough pass at EPC draw schedule in attached Excel for 2,3,4,5 and 6 unit 
plants - assumes two week spacing on start up - based on normal simple cycle 
deal. If we need to do major LM6000 payments up front then we should have a 
front end weighted curve (I will go ahead and generate a front-ended curve 
for each config) - depends on how we really extract each from WestLB deal - 
above my pay grade to know those lofty things.

Data is based on ElectriCities installation schedule from Nepco, we are 
working to see if we can compress actual time in field as part of reducing 
project anticipated cost so might be better once Mike Coleman and Bruce work 
our magic. % are from my vast experience and would be challenged and derided 
if a real cost engineer looks at them but at least they add to 100% (I hope) 
and sort of match our Hainan experience with three of these LM6000's.

Folks,

Attached is a listing of retail shorts accrued to date.  The idea is to use 
our LM6000's, 6B's or Italian turbines to cover these positions.  Maybe we 
could sell the combination of shorts and machines to an IPP such as Calpine 
or AES who should be looking for earnings.  I would like to meet Friday at 
10:30 to plot out strategy and discuss the required analysis.  In the 
interim, please familiarise yourself with the data.

regards,

Don Black

Jinsung,

Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.

We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.

Here is the assumptions and the prices:

180MW
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
summer.

Prices are June-May yearly calculations
3yr $3.89kw-mo
5yr $3.84kw-mo

At this stage, the desk does not have a different price for the 4hr block 
product

Edith,

- Substation location: Sayerville
- Gas: Transco Zone 6 (no additional cost for LDC)
- Unit contingent call
- 97% availability: It should be OK since we can assume 97% during summer 
time and 90~93% during non-summer time, for example.

Could you get the pricing for following scenario based on above assumption?

Flat and annual capacity payment for 3 and 5 year
With 16 hour block and 4 hour block

Please call me, if it doesn't make sense.

Team,

I finally got a chance to talk to Entergy about their merchant peaker in 
their own service territory.  Specifics are as follows:

Configuration: 4 x GE 7EA's at 72 - 73 MW each because of elevation and 
humidity levels.
Location: Vicksburg, MS sharing a site with the Baxter Wilson plant (1320 MW 
coal/gas fired boiler)
HHV: 12,200 btu/kwh
Pipe: A new intra-state that will be shared with the Baxter Wilson plant.  
Existing sources are Koch and Duke.
Start date: 7/01
Permits: PSD permit at 9 ppm.  No run hour limitation.
Taxes: Fee in lieu of taxes at 1/3 cost for first ten years.  Full property 
taxes thereafter.  Entergy claims this is the same deal Ben Jacoby got for 
our peaker in MS.

First we need to model a pro-forma of plant operating costs using estimates 
of FOM and VOM from internal sources.
Second, we need to calculate spread option valuations of the underlying plant 
for 20-years using curve, vol and correlation assumptions acceptable to the 
desk.
Thirdly and based on 20-year plant valuations, I need to create a debt 
service schedule.
Finally, we have to price the put option premium and sensitivities using the 
research/structuring model.

Any questions, please call me at 3-4750.

regards,

Don

Scott: Please see below.

1.  How much would this pricing change if power could be called ion 4 hour 
blocks and the availability percentages were 97%?
       - 4 hour block call: There is a possibility to get better pricing.
 - 97% availability: Structuring wants to make sure that there is no 
regulatory limitation in related to environmental issue, which may prevent 
97% availability.

2.  What pricing does the 20 year project model show that we need?
 - We also need power curve from year 3 to 20 to calculate Calpine's merchant 
revenue.
 - We are currently refining the model regarding IDC, residual value, etc.

3.  What additional information do you need from me to complete your analysis?
 - Unit contingency or liquidated damage protection
 - Exact location for power and gas

Once we find out unit contingency and location, I will get the pricing with a 
couple of scenarios as you asked: 
 - Flat and annual capacity for 3 and 5 year
 - Power curve from year 3 to 20

Here is the UAE transaction structure I discussed with the accountants:

1.  UAE to execute a financial gas contract which is highly in our favor 
(large to market value) with a buyout provision equal to our targeted option 
premium ($4-6 million).  UAE can cancel the contract by a defined date by 
forfeiting their $4-6 million deposit/option premium.  We should be able to 
mark the deposit because it is our worst case payment.  UAE should be 
motivated to cancel the contract because it will be out of the money to them.

2.  UAE to negotiate a purchase agreement for the turbines.  This purchase 
agreement will be conditioned upon the execution of a tolling agreement under 
defined terms and upon UAE making an initial payment for the turbines by a 
defined date in the future (one of the dates discussed at our meeting).  Up 
until this date, the turbine purchase agreement shall be cancellable at no 
cost to UAE.

The gas contract should be markable as long as it is delinked to the turbine 
purchase agreement.  We can capture the effective of an option in the turbine 
purchase agreement by making it cancellable at no cost up to some defined 
date.

What do you think?

I spoke with CIPCO today on our proposal submitted on 4/28/00 and they are 
initially interested in what we put together (i.e. 2 GE-7EA's) with right to 
substitute technology as long as overall project economics are not impacted.

They will be meeting with their consultants tomorrow (5/5/00) to come up with 
a list of questions to help develop a short list.

Assuming we make it to a short list, then we will be asked to come to Iowa to 
meet with their generation planning team.

All of this should play out over the next 3-4 weeks.


(Also, please note that we are looking at this as a way to substitute 3 
LM-6000's for the two EA's and keep the heat rate spread.  A plant at CIPCO 
also is an OPPD workout.  We have a site under option in Iowa that is into 
Mid-Am 345Kv and Alliant/CIPCO.

FYI

ENA was low bidder for the LM-6000 deal with Rochester.  I will be calling 
Rochester today to determine next actions steps.  Please note that our 
proposal is contingent upon a bundled deal.  I would not take this as an 
indication of a done deal. (i.e. No Green Sheet Yet)

Ben,

I think we need to clean the Calpine model. We will get the firmer pricing 
from Structuring tomorrow. As soon as we have that, we need to come back to 
Scott with the pricing and the model. Here is some comments.

- Install switch to see unlevered IRR
- Clean up IDC

Scott wants to see what would be the capacity pricing to get unlevered IRR of 
9%. Let's talk in the morning.

George and Webb, please find attached revision one to the Santee Cooper O&M 
cost estimate. It is for mobilization and operating period O&M services for 
one gas fired, 5 x LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility located at the 
Georgia and South Carolina border. 


The revision made adjustments to the following:
      Rev 0   Rev 1
Mobilization fee     $90,000   $200,000
Annual Operating fee    $160,000  $250,000
Annual Maintenance cost Estimate  $405,000  $593,000
Mobilization Labor cost (adjusted benefits) $175,000  $193,000
Annual Labor cost (adjusted benefits)  $406,000  $450,000
Initial Spare Parts    $1,320,000  $1,300,000

My reasoning is this:
1. After consulting with OEC, the previous fees were not believed to be at 
"market".
2. Annual Maintenance was recalculated after having more time to do a bottom 
up estimate.
3. Mob and annual labor costs changed due to a change in OEC benefits 
calculations.
4. Initial spares rounded down.

As we discussed, the GT major maintenance is scheduled to occur in year 18 of 
an 18 year term. 

Please provide your comments.

Carl and Brad,

Ben and I had a meeting with Don Black on Retail Short this morning. We think 
the project is moving well. We finished the first cut of model and are 
preparing some sensitivity analyses. One of them which Don wants to see is 
correlation sensitivity. Don want to have 50%, 60%, and 70% correlation 
scenario. Could you please run the spread option model with 50% and 60% 
correlation? Thank you.

Ben, Matthew, Jim, Jason:

As per discussion, I have created a common folder 
o:naes/from_ko/LM6000s/Control, for storage of the cost configuation model 
and finanicial base model.

Since Ben has to model Lincoln by next week, I suggest we use his model as 
the go forward base model from now onwards. By modeling an actual 
transaction, it would be easier for us to identify needed changes and links.

If you guys have time, please look thru the model and list the changes 
needed. We could then have a meeting next week to go through the suggestions 
and discuss how to coordinate taking turns working on the model.


Ben:

I will continue making cosmetic changes to the model for now, but I would 
make sure that the changes do not mess up the economics of the transaction.



Everyone:  

If any of you need to model anything, please use this base model. If you do 
not have access to the directory, please create a security request form 
through lotus notes.

Thanks.

Michelle, I just faxes you an executed copy of the CA.

In addition, please find the turbine payment schedule, attached.  We are 
possibly signing a deal for the April 2000 payment ($69MM) tomorrow (so move 
quickly if you want that one!).  Therefore, I would suggest that you mainly 
focus on the payments scheduled after April 2000.  Finally, please keep in 
mind that the last column is for ABB turbines for our Arkansas project (the 
rest are GE).

Please give me a call to discuss.  I should be in the office today until 
around 2:00, and then back on Monday.

Don,

Currently, our model assumes total project cost of $558/kW (EPC: $509/kW with 
turbine cost of $303/kW, Soft cost: $45/kW, Financing cost: $5/kW) . I think 
$558/kW may be too conservative (compare to what I have been hearing), so I 
ran some sensitivities on project cost as follows. The result is not 
negligible. See you tomorrow.

Regards,

Jinsung

Maybe the message is garbled but 4 7FA's and 2 STG's (probably two 2 X 1 
CCGT's) should be nominally $470,000,000 based on the Pittsburg CCGT out in 
California (but includes no real EPC contractor margin/contingency so will 
not match what Nepco or other third parties might bid), would nominally be 
480 MW at 95F for each 2 X 1 so about 960 MW for all. I think this works out 
to about $489/kW. This based on about $34,000,000 for each GE7FA so pricing 
will adjust if market price higher or lower.

I honestly don't and have not seen a 501G price. I did see 701G prices in 
Asia and they appeared to be about 5% lower per kilowatt than 701F and 
GE9FA's. In this hot market they maybe at a premium due to better heat rate 
and larger unit size. I would suggest $515/kW as a go by. I have called John 
Garrison to see what current pricing and delivery is - also to see if 
performance might be a touch better than our maybe two year old model. Do we 
want to get an estimate from Nepco or a benchmark from my estimator's? I 
would need a charge number/tasking letter.

Ben, When do you need an O&M estimate by and what are your accuracy 
requirements? I have a couple other projects in the hopper that I'm working 
on now. For an accuracy of +/- 25%, I can have you numbers by this 
Friday/Monday timeframe. If you require +/- 10% accuracy, I would need until 
next Thursday/Friday timeframe (2/18) assuming good information is available. 
For this type accuracy, we're also going to need to know about water 
source/treatment, plant design, etc. From talking with Bruce Golden, my guess 
is that we are not there yet on design so you may be looking for the +/- 25% 
accuracy estimate for now. FYI, Bruce Golden is also filling in an eval form. 
thanks and regards, Scot

Subject: Additional information for Rochester

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

Subject: Lincoln, Nebraska Preliminary O&M Estimate

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to "charge" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot

Ben and Jinsung,

We have not had time to pass this information by the traders.  If we resolve 
the issues regarding location, unit contingency, etc., we can get a better 
number from the traders.  For now, these are indicative prices only.  Once we 
understand the deal better, we can talk to the traders and get a firmer 
price.  Also, Jim Fallon has requested that his traders receive a term sheet 
prior to agreeing to a price.

Here is the information you requested, based on the assumptions sent in the 
e-mail below:

Further assumptions:
180 MW
Priced at PJM East hub, no cost is added for any transmission
Must be called in 16 hour blocks
Total start costs: $1200 per start ($300 per turbine)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability

3 year capacity:  $3.80 kw/mo
5 year capacity:  $3.74 kw/mo

2.  What pricing does the 20 year project model show that we need?

3.  What additional information do you need from me to complete your analysis?

Not sure how you can actualize these prices but here is what I think you were 
asking for...



So if you have 50MW then 50 times $ per MW available for sale.

According to Dave Botchlett, we should be able to use the Low Sulfur HO curve 
that is in the file I've given you in the past with the 3 cent transport cost 
over the NYH mean.  

He did a question:   Can we ship the oil into the plant on barges or on cargo 
ships as opposed to trucking?

Attached is the updated file

Looks like a 2 X 1 MHI 501G plant would produce about 684MW plant net output 
at a heat rate of 6684 Btu/kWhr net new&clean. 

Still looking for capital cost.

Scott,

Below is the new capacity pricing (improved by $0.1/kw-mo) based off of 
10,200 heat rate, which is still long way to go. I will make a more effort to 
get better pricing. There is still a room between mid curve and bid curve. 
Another possibility is to sell by 4 hour block with better pricing, as you 
commented. Please let me know if you have any better idea. Thank you.

Calpine Pricing

Jinsung,

Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.

We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.

Here is the assumptions and the prices:

180MW
HEAT RATE 10,200 (previously 10,500)
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability in winter, 97% in summer
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
WINTER.

We conducted a conference call with Lincoln today and they advised they are 
no longer interested in working with Enron on the LM-6000 opportunity that 
had been under consideration.  The main reasons given was that there was 
extreme existance in the organization.  Lincoln said they would need an 
annual payment of $90 to $100 per kw/yr to do the deal which they feel is 
extremely out of the market and Enron would not transact.  At this level, we 
would be break-even at best, even with the OPPD work-out value and the gas 
deal.

Lincoln is currently developing a peaking project using ABB units that must 
be in operation 6/01.  All of their resources are dedicated to this project.  
Their plan is to install LM-6000's for a 11/1/03 start date and they are not 
prepared to deal with an acceleration of the project.  The feel that working 
with Enron at this time only complicates their workload.

Lincoln did say they were interested in working with us on a gas supply and 
pipeline transaction as the site for development is 6 miles from Northern 
Natural Gas.  

I will begin this evaluation and consider the possibility of selling two 
LM-6000's bundled with the supply and infrastructure deal.

Bruce -

We have set up an on-site meeting with UAE next Wednesday (Mar  in Boston 
(Lowell, MA actually).  We will be arriving around noon, so an early am 
flight into Boston would probably work.  I don't know what your calendar is 
like, but I hope you can fit this meeting in, as your inclusion in imperative.

Also, FYI, I am going to be with Reed and one of his Fin guys in Bank meeting 
earlier in the week, so we should have some more ideas regarding their 
options (if any) in financing structures for the project.

Regards,

Tom

Ben,

Could you forward to me name and phone number of EE&CC person who you are 
contacting to get VOM? I will give it to Thomas in case he wants to give him 
a call. Thanks. Jin

Subject: Calpine deal summary

Thomas,

Here is a Calpine deal summary. 

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, Heat rate, dispatch, and location of the 
plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of ENA 
bid curve.

I think it will be helpful if Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so that we 
can talk to Structuring group. Please review and let me know if it makes 
sense, and then I will send you, Scott, Richard Park, and Tom Swank.

If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group tomorrow. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not 
sure what exactly this is for. Thank you.

Team,

We've done a lot of good work lately on the evaluation models and I think we 
are converging on a platform that accurately models the product, the project 
and my structure's risk.  The only remaining issues when we're done will 
relate to the curves.

Just so we're all on the same page, I thought I would lay out the base 
scenario:

Hourly vols
Mid power and oil curves
Beginning debt of $375/kw amortising mortgage style over 20-years
Debt interest rates of T+225
Plant residual value of $100/kw
Enron will own a 50 MW call from 5/2001 to 12/31/2020.  Strike prices will be 
$50/mwh for years 1-5, $75/mwh for years 6-10, and $100/mwh for the balance 
of the term.
The basic put or no put trigger algorithm is (plant value + put option value 
>= par amount of bonds outstanding).  As the model calculates equity's 
decision whether or not to put the plant to Enron, we should reduce each 
years par amount of bonds outstanding by the debt service reserve fund.  This 
proxy's the fact that equity will consider when making their put decision 
each year that there are moneys in the DSRF, working capital reserves and 
equity sweep accounts.
Whatever power/oil correlation's structuring thinks are appropriate.

I hope to see results Monday.  If there are any questions, please call me at 
3-4750.

regards,

Don Black

Ben,

I found that you should have considered that power plant will operate from 
June 2001, which means we can only realize the spread option value of 7 
months, not of a whole year. Please make the changes as well as clean up the 
"Opion" page. We should start to think about going to RAROC and to scrub the 
model.

What is the source of the financing assumptions?

We got the numbers. They are about $4.00/kw-mo, not yet good enough. Ben and 
I will try to talk to you first thing tomorrow morning. The model is ready

Coming back to browse through our notes on why we do this crazy thing called 
the MS150, we find that the primary inspiration is to assist the MS Society 
in its mission to encourage and provide for the needs of MS patients and give 
them the hope of endless possibilities.

PEDAL FOR PARTNERS is a new program this year designed to help MS patients 
feel part of the trek.  It creates a bond with them that is much appreciate 
and it gives them hope to know that we're out there.  Those who could ride,  
would ride, and some of those who can't are waiting at the finish line in 
Austin to tell you how much it meant to them to see you come in on your bike.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WEAR A RIBBON ON YOUR RIDE WHICH HAS BEEN SIGNED BY AN 
MS PATIENT, IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  THAT PERSON'S ADDRESS IS 
PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE RIBBON SO THAT WHEN YOU GET BACK YOU CAN MAIL IT TO 
THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM YOU RODE.

You can pick one up at the meeting tomorrow, get one from me in 3AC3120, 
Stephanie Strong at EB2414, or Becky Pham at EB2422A.  For you non-Enron 
riders, if you'll let us know this week, we can mail it to you.

Ben -

We need to talk this morning about RPU.  I am not sure you have recieved this 
e-mail.  If you have not it is my fault.  We need to forward this information 
to structuring to evaluate the plant.  Sorry and thanks for the help.

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

Calpine Pricing

Jinsung,

Below are the indicative prices for the Calpine deal assuming there are no 
additional gas costs related to 
the transport of gas from the Transco Sayreville meter point and the 
potential site.

We have passed this by the trader, Paul Racicot.  If we enter the next round 
of negotiations where specific information
has become available, a stronger price is possible but we would need to deal 
more specifically with the Unit Contingent
aspect and the gas cost from meter to site.

Here is the assumptions and the prices:

180MW
Priced at Sayreville (discount to  Eastern hub)
Must be called in 16 blocks
5x16 product
Total start cost: $1200 per start ($300 per unit)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability in winter, 97% in summer
Gas priced at NY zone 6 with $0.03 physical premium in summer, and $0.07 in 
WINTER.

Scott,

Structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the 
pricing from a trader.

Capacity
 - Will Calpine be able to get manufacturer's guarantee for net capacity (or 
can we re-sell turbines to third party?)
 - Is it "unit contingent call" or there will be a "liquidated damage 
protection" within the tolling agreement?

Nodal pricing
 - What is the exact name of substation in eastern PJM? Structuring could not 
find "Parlin" in eastern PJM (even within eastern PJM, there will a 
substantial pricing differential among different bus points).

Gas delivery point

Actually, it is really hard to get the number by today since a trader who 
will give pricing is not here today. If we don't hear from you or/and if you 
don't decide yet about above issues, we will make assumptions as follow;

- Capacity: 180 MW out of 4 LM-6000 turbine with manufacturer's guarantee and 
with term of liquidated damage protection included.
- Exact substation: East Hub in PJM
- Gas delivery point: Transco Zone 6

We will try to get the pricing hopefully by tomorrow. Please call me at 
713-853-7330, if you have any question. Thank you.

Jinsung

BEn,


Here is the schedule I currently have for TECO. Would you mind having a look 
and telling me if it takes into account the debt reserve?
thanks

Ben, its all been moved to one sheet and is available in the naes directory 
as well. It's password protected so just view at it read-only. If you see 
anything that needs to change let me know. By the way, when you open it up 
sometimes it can look kind of psychadelic - just zoom in or out and it fixes 
itself. Thanks.

Ryan

Ben, please find attached the preliminary cost estimate for full O&M services 
provided at one greenfield, stand alone 2 x LM6000 PC Sprint simple cycle 
power project located at St Peter, Illinois. The project is assumed to be 
100% gas-fired and operating 1,600 hrs per year in the months of May through 
September. The staffing plan does not anticipate operations during the other 
months of the year. The tentative schedule is NTP 9/00 and COD 6/01. Ameren 
is to own and operate.



A couple of questions:
1. Where is Ameren's headquarters located, i.e. the home office where their 
O&M staff would get their admin, technical support?
2. Who will own and operate the same plant that Spectrum is building 20 miles 
to the north of St Peter?

Please review and call should you have questions or comments.

regards, Scot

Don, per your request attached is the model I created to value the 
transaction.  This model was created utilizing the Origination/Structuring 
model as a starting point.  I have used EPMI/ENA's power and fuel curves as 
opposed to the company's base case pricing scenario.  I have also used a 
mortgage style debt amortization based on $118MM of funded debt.  Attached is 
a memo that touches on the transaction, the value of the price risk 
management contracts, financial results, and some closing comments.  

Regards,

Christopher

Ben, please find attached an O&M cost estimate for one oil fired 6 x 1 
LM6000PC power project located in Homestead, FL. The estimate assumes 1,400 
run hours in simple cycle during the first year (without SCR) and 2,500 run 
hours in combined cycle for years 2+, with SCR. Given that it's combined 
cycle in years 2+, the staffing plan is assuming year round availability 
needs (except for agreed upon Scheduled Outages). Please note the increase in 
GT Major Scheduled Maintenance costs due to liquid firing.



Please review it and let me know if you have questions or comments.

Mark and Tom, sorry for the short notice. Can you please review and provide 
comment, particularly on the proposed staffing plan and Operator fees?

regards, Scot

As a follow up to our conversation yesterday, I need indicative pricing for a 
three (3) year and a five (5) year tolling option for a peaking plant to be 
located in eastern PJM, which would utilize 4 (four) LM-6000 turbines.  
Assume a 6/1/2001 start date and a location near Parlin New Jersey.  The 
structure of the transaction would be as follows:

1.  ENA would sell four (4) LM-6000s to Calpine.
2.  ENA would permit, construct, own and operate the project.
3.  ENA would take back a short-term tolling agreement for the project.

I would like to send Calpine a brief proposal in the net couple of weeks.  
How quickly can you come up with indicative pricing for me?

After reviewing the CIPCO RFP, Enron has questions that we would like to have 
answered.  I will call you on Friday to follow-up on these:


1.  Who is Henwood Energy Services and what aspect of the RFP will they 
review?

2.  What role will Burns & McDonnell play in the RFP and subsequent project.

3.  Enron controls several development sites in Iowa that provide direct 
access into Alliant.  Does CIPCO's transmission arrangements with Alliant 
allow for a network service whereby energy injected anywhere into the Alliant 
Grid in Iowa can be returned to CIPCO under the present transmission 
arrangement.

4.  Enron also controls sites on Mid-Am in Iowa.  Does CIPCO have network 
rights on Mid-Am or direct ties with Mid-Am.  Would generation on the Mid-Am 
system be of value to CIPCO.

5.  CIPCO states they will consider proposals beyond the 2005 timeframe.  How 
many years would CIPCO consider under a transaction where new generation is 
being built in a jointly developed project.?

6.  CIPCO states they have reviewed several sites for generation 
development.  Can CIPCO provide Enron with a list of preferred sites?

7.  Does CIPCO own separate transmission facilities or is the CIPCO system 
assumed to be CIPCO's network transmission contract on the Alliant System?

8.  Would CIPCO consider a project utilizing the General Electric LM-6000 
technology as we described in our previous meeting in November 1999.

9.  On a new capital project, would CIPCO finance the project with RUS 
financing, internal sources or be interested in financing through Enron?

10.  If Enron is not successful in the RFP and CIPCO elects to build a new 
plant, would CIPCO work with Enron to structure a delivered gas supply 
transaction whereby Enron would provide a new connecting gas lateral, gas 
transportation service and physical gas supply.

I would appreciate you insights on the above.


Thanks

Scott,

Structuring got back to us with some issues we need to clarify to get the 
pricing from a trader.

Capacity
 - Will Calpine be able to get manufacturer's guarantee for net capacity (or 
can we re-sell turbines to third party?)
 - Is it "unit contingent call" or there will be a kind of "liquidated damage 
protection" within the tolling agreement?

Nodal pricing
 - What is the exact name of substation in eastern PJM? Structuring could not 
find "Parlin" (even within eastern PJM, there will a substantial pricing 
differential among different bus points).

Gas delivery point

Actually, it is really hard to get the number by today since a trader who 
will give pricing is not here today and such a short period of notice. If we 
don't hear from you or/and if you don't decide yet, we will make assumption 
as follows;

- Capacity: 180 MW out of 4 LM-6000 turbine with manufacturer's guarantee and 
with term of liquidated damage protection included.
- Exact substation: East Hub in PJM
- Gas delivery point: Transco Zone 6

We will try to get the pricing hopefully by tomorrow. Please call me at 
713-853-7330, if you have any question. Thank you.

Jinsung

Ben and Thomas,
Here is a first pass on the turbines.  Still waiting on info for the ABB 
turbines from Canada.  This still needs to be reviewed by Ben Jacoby.

Quick question:

Do the heat rates you have in your spreadsheet change with the addition of 
chillers?  We are looking at an LM6000 deal in Entergy in which the customer 
would add chillers (no cost to us) and I wonder if this changes heat rate.  
Thanks for your time,

Claire

Carl,

Don want to have following assumptions:

- ENA deals with just energy piece, not anciliary service portion.
- Gas curve: Transco zone 6 (may be bundled one)
- Power curve: East hub of NY power pool
- EES short load is fixed

For valuation;

   Revenue from serving load (to make 12% IRR for an IPP)
+ Spread option value
+ ICAP
-  Fixed expenses
= NI

This sure sounds like a deal Len Gunderson was looking at early this year and 
a large chemical facility. The capacity for the project did not match what 
equipment it was based on - any more details so I can see if we have any data 
from that earlier look?

I spoke with Wally Schlink of Rochester today in follow up to our c-call.  He 
thought the call went well; however, he still fees the main point is the 
price for the PPA.

RPU will be meeting with their Financial Advisor on Monday and they plan to 
then meet internally and figure what they would want from Enron to do the 
deal.  I believe the will give us their number next week and we will know 
where to head from there.

In the interim we need to be working on the following:


1.  Response to the RFP in their format
2.  Prepare a bid bond and get an understanding as to what it may bind us to 
do.

I would like for Russ to take lead on these matters.  

Note that we cannot go forward with Rochester unless we are technically in 
the process.

Subject: Santee Cooper O&M Estimate, Revision 1

George and Webb, please find attached revision one to the Santee Cooper O&M 
cost estimate. It is for mobilization and operating period O&M services for 
one gas fired, 5 x LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility located at the 
Georgia and South Carolina border. 


The revision made adjustments to the following:
      Rev 0   Rev 1
Mobilization fee     $90,000   $200,000
Annual Operating fee    $160,000  $250,000
Annual Maintenance cost Estimate  $405,000  $593,000
Mobilization Labor cost (adjusted benefits) $175,000  $193,000
Annual Labor cost (adjusted benefits)  $406,000  $450,000
Initial Spare Parts    $1,320,000  $1,300,000

My reasoning is this:
1. After consulting with OEC, the previous fees were not believed to be at 
"market".
2. Annual Maintenance was recalculated after having more time to do a bottom 
up estimate.
3. Mob and annual labor costs changed due to a change in OEC benefits 
calculations.
4. Initial spares rounded down.

As we discussed, the GT major maintenance is scheduled to occur in year 18 of 
an 18 year term. 

Please provide your comments.

Subject: Standard Model

Ben, Matthew, Jim, Jason:

As per discussion, I have created a common folder 
o:naes/from_ko/LM6000s/Control, for storage of the cost configuation model 
and finanicial base model.

Since Ben has to model Lincoln by next week, I suggest we use his model as 
the go forward base model from now onwards. By modeling an actual 
transaction, it would be easier for us to identify needed changes and links.

If you guys have time, please look thru the model and list the changes 
needed. We could then have a meeting next week to go through the suggestions 
and discuss how to coordinate taking turns working on the model.


Ben:

I will continue making cosmetic changes to the model for now, but I would 
make sure that the changes do not mess up the economics of the transaction.



Everyone:  

If any of you need to model anything, please use this base model. If you do 
not have access to the directory, please create a security request form 
through lotus notes.

Thanks.

Thomas,

Here is a Calpine deal summary. 

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, Heat rate, dispatch, and location of the 
plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of ENA 
bid curve.

I think it will be helpful if Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so that we 
can talk to Structuring group. Please review and let me know if it makes 
sense, and then I will send you, Scott, Richard Park, and Tom Swank.

If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group tomorrow. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not 
sure what exactly this is for. Thank you.

Did Bruce (EECC/NEPCO) give project cost numbers? In order to calculate FOM 
and VOM, I'll need to know more about the project. Can we discuss later this 
week, say Thursday? Please try to answer these questions in the two attached

Subject: UAE - LM6000 deal

Gautam and Elizabeth-

Perhaps you can work on this together, so that you get familiar with these 
LM6000 projects...there are only going to be more of them.  


Here is the info I just got from Ben about pricing up a new LM6000 project 
for UAE

4 LM 6000's in Lowell, MA (near Boston)

45 MW per turbine
Use:       Nepool Power Curve
 Transco Z 6 Gas Curve

5 year deal starting 5/01

Variable O&M :  $2.25/MWh
Heat Rate:  (Ben will send us)
Per Start cost:  (Ben will send us)

ENA would build the plant for UAE - and we would enter into a PPA with them 
to receive power from that plant (so we would want to get a $/kW-mo number 
somewhere between the desk's mid and bid price)

Ben has put togethe ra model that does not include our curves, but he is 
looking at projects costs given a 70/30 debt/equity ratio, at 8.5%.  The 
target return is 12%

Ben would like to see our estimates of $/kW-mo on a yearly basis 

So, run this through Jim's dispatch model (in userpub/todd/jhs/sprd opt 
dispatch model 021800) - to calculate yearly $/kW-month numbers then we'll 
show the desk to get their estimates of $/kW-mo

Thanks for your time!

Claire

Subject: City of Austin 4 x LM6000 O&M Estimate

Jason, please find attached the O&M estimate for the City of Austin 4 x 
LM6000PC gas fired, simple cycle power project. It shows the estimated cost 
for the Operator's Mobilization Period ($/kW) and Annual Operating Period 
average FOM and average VOM for both 3 year and 20 year periods. The estimate 
assumes the addition of operating staff at the project, but that maintenance, 
supervision and administration services can be performed by existing staffing 
at Austin Energy. The staffing is such that the peak periods could be manned 
for round the clock availability and eased off in the non-peak months. I have 
shown an O&M fee during Mobilization and Annual Operating Periods designed to 
cover this service, as well as the Operator's risk for meeting Availability 
requirements.



Per Sandra's request, I have not shown the GT and SCR reserve calculations in 
the estimate, but for purposes of documenting with our team, they are 
estimated to be:
GT Reserve = $54/fired hour (20 year term)
SCR Reserve = $25/fired hour (assume 40,000 hr life)

Please review and call if you would like to discuss further.

regards, Scot

Here are the responses to my CIPCO questions

1.  Henwood Energy is a third party evaluation consultant.  They will review 
the RFP responses

2.  Burns & McDonald has assisted in site selection/review and will 
participate in evaluation of any self-builds that CIPCO does.

3.  CIPCO has a preference to purchase from the market or from plants that 
Enron would develop.  They are not big on wanting to build their own plant or 
JV.

4.  CIPCO has identified a key site in Iowa that has direct access to their 
own system as well as the Mid-Am system.  They would make that site available 
to us if we needed it.  They will not reveal the site unless we get into 
negotiations.

5.  CIPCO will consider terms longer than 5 years.  They would consider a 
15-20 year term if there was a capital project involved.

6.  CIPCO does have their own transmission system as well as point/point 
transmission agreements on Mid-Am and Alliant.  The point to point agreement 
are from plants where CIPCO owns a partial share to CIPCO's system.

7.  CIPCO appeared to not value the LM-6000 technology to any higher degree 
than other machines.

8.  CIPCO was not sure of how things would be financed.

9.  If CIPCO decided to self build, they would certainly be interested in 
working with Enron on the gas deal.

Mike, Ben,
I had sent both models but just noticed that they didn't go through as they 
were too large.  So you'll get this in two parts.
Here is Winston Cheng's model.  In Kate's view it would be better to use 
Winston's model as it incorporates the intrinsic and extrinsic valuation 
elements and the curves, but also covers the US tax situation (plus she says 
it is MORE SOPHISTICATED...!).

Our model will follow by another note.

Ben,

I have put together a quick estimate of the adder to get from the "two 7EA 
open cycle peaker configuration" to the "2x1 combined cycle configuration", 
adding the two HRSGs and 100 Mw steam turbine along with extra BOP equipment. 
The estimate was quick and is therefore +/- 20% accuracy. Beyond this 
accuracy, we would need a tasking letter.

Your CIPCO Proforma for EPC costs of two 7EAs Open Cycle = $57,580,000 or 
$378.82/Kw

The rough cost estimate (+/-20%) of the 2x1 Combined Cycle  = $130,336,000 or 
$493.70/Kw
 (See Attached Analysis)

The estimated adder for conversion to 2x1 Combined Cycle is therefore:

   $130,336,000
   -$ 57,580,000
   ____________
Estimated Adder is =  $72,756,000      +/- 20% 

Hope this data is sufficient for your needs. Please call me at ext 67958 if 
you need any clarification beyond the attached.

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

Ben,

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS


Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d

Attached is the BaseModel3 which a note/questions page has been added to 
highlight changes made to the basemodel3 as well as questions regarding the 
specifics for the LES project. The Bernstein model is also attached with 
changes made to reflect the LES project.  In some cases, numbers have been 
changed to zero in places where LES specific information is needed in both 
models. Marilyn

Attached is our best guess at a likely EPC cost - full disclosure on our 
margin(profit) guess. I added gas compression per Janet's note - I still 
think we should pitch this without compression and add it if we need to. I 
think that is Charles' plan also. Has Jim heard anything from Lone Star????


Jason - I can't get Billy's address to work through email - would make sure 
he gets a copy???

Look at this great idea that Kelly Strader and Charla Reese "cooked up."    
Charla made the arrangements for us, and she says that reservations are not 
required.  I hope you can all make it, and if you do, what will Jimmy do with 
all of us?  That's his problem - he invited us!  I'll send a reminder next 
week.

Ben, please find attached an O&M cost estimate for one oil fired 6 x 1 
LM6000PC power project located in Homestead, FL. The estimate assumes 1,400 
run hours in simple cycle during the first year (without SCR) and 2,500 run 
hours in combined cycle for years 2+, with SCR. Given that it's combined 
cycle in years 2+, the staffing plan is assuming year round availability 
needs (except for agreed upon Scheduled Outages). Please note the increase in 
GT Major Scheduled Maintenance costs due to liquid firing.



Please review it and let me know if you have questions or comments.

Mark and Tom, sorry for the short notice. Can you please review and provide 
comment, particularly on the proposed staffing plan and Operator fees?

regards, Scot

I have attached the pitch book.  I think its a good start.  I didn't get
into the proposals as much, but we can kick that around in more detail.

 I think the more important thing is who (as in exact individuals) gets the
sales pitch.   This will be the key to getting a major deal completed.

Call me with questions, I'll be in and out the today and Monday.  On Tuesday
I start my journey across the country.  If you need me those days call me at
my home number and my wife will relay the messages to me.

Ben,

I think we need to start to build model, rather than waiting for Structuring. 
Once we build template, we can finish model just by dropping curves from 
Structuring. Could you adjust our existing LM 6000 model to reflect our 
valuation method as follow;

Valuation of Retail Short =
+ Revenue from serving load (to get 12% IRR)
+  Expense from serving load at the market
+ Spread option value for full capacity (190MW)
+ ICAP ($1.00/kw-mo for 6 months)
- Fixed expenses

Please let me know if this is too much on your plate. Thanks. 

Jinsung

Rochester was interested in our proposal.  As such, they want to do a 
conference call and meeting as follows:


1.  Conference call on Thursday 2/24 at 9:00 a.m. (their general manager will 
be involved)
2.  Depending on the conference call, Rochester will want us to come up for 
another face to face meeting on Tuesday, 2/29


Some of Rochester's key questions are as follows:

1.  Whats our PPA value?  I asked them to name it and they said they would 
want enough to cove their debt service...Also, they said they are fair and 
they are not greedy.

2.  Rochester wants to verify scope.  Are we offering turnkey?  I told them 
yes...they want to discuss details.  Where did we price the electric 
interconnect.  To the busbar or to inlet of step up transformer?

3.  Rochester has the ability to individually negotiate with us as long as we 
respond to their bid on time and provide a bid bond.  If we do not respond, 
then they have to get city council approval to negotiate directly.  
Basically, we need to complete some of the bid form to get us in the door.

4.  Bids are open on 3/10/00

ACTION ITEMS

1.  Russ, Ben, Oscar and Ozzie to participate in conference call on 2/24.

2.  Russ, Ben and Ozzie to go to Rochester if warranted.  ( I am unable to 
travel during that week)

3.  Determine if other Enron participants need to be involved (Mike Nanney, 
etc....Mike went on the first site visit with me)

4.  Respond to Rochester in bid format and look into getting a bid bond.

4.  Russ, Ben and Oscar work together to come up with a PPA value

5.  Verify whether we  want a second merchant unit at the site.

SUMMARY

Rocheste seems to be very open and agreeable to doing business with Enron.  I 
feel we need to push this one.

First of our stuff coming to you.

Following attachment is chilling calc for Ft Devens - which was the nearest 
site we thought might be representative of Lowell. I will confirm the 1% 
occurance basis we used (80F DB, 63.5F WB and 40% RH). I calc 790 tons/unit 
hour, we used 812 tons/per in our performance run. Design basis of chilling 
plant in our conceptual EPC would be maybe 3600 total tons (at the 80F/40% 
point) so there would be some margin to meet 50F inlet air at slightly higher 
ambients.



Obviously if you have different design point due to your owm plant data or 
your own criteria, we would be glad to rerun/size based on your suggestion. 
Balls in your court on this. Ft devens data coming to you by epressmail - we 
can also fax (fax number ???)- just 6 sheets - I need to find the procedure 
and/or worksheet on how we got the 1% point - I can't see it in this package.

Water data sheet is attached - obviously list is exhaustive but my water 
doctor asks if your team could fill out as much as possible so we can give 
you our best shot a suggesting a treatment system - might be helpful to have 
my water guy talk with your water guy so they conceptualize the new to fit 
well with the existing



I did get the voicemail, but managed to scribble unintelligebly (can't spell 
either) early this AM - I have Paul B.???? at 978-454-6166 (also hit the 
earse on my mail in my automatic mode this AM. Likely Ron Smith 713-345-5768 
will call.

The following is the data we developed and provided to a possible Austin, 
Texas job. Obviously water is different so unit cost may change but probably 
will keep same pecking order.

 Water options as follows

1) Rental mobile demineralizer    $10.57/1000 gal based on 1500 hrs/yr
2) Rental mobile demin with lease degasifier  $9.75/1000 gas for 5 yr then 
$7.85 on
3) Rental mobile RO with exchange tank mixed beds $7.22/1000 gal
4) Purchase RO with exchange tank mixed beds  $4.75/1000 gal
5) Purchase demineralizer    $5.77/1000 gal

Options 3, 4 and 5 require wastewater discharge. All systems assume on-site 
water storage. design is that system would run 22-24 hrs per day to make 
enough water for 10 hr daily run. Can run 24 hr+ with tank dropping. 
Generally these should be concidered as 1 X 100% unit (capable of supporting 
10 hr day) - if run more, truck water from Decker, call for emergency trailer 
demin, can operate units on limited water but would see NOx increase 

I need to run performance by our management and then get Tom's blessing 
before I send.

Best data I have on water consumption is that with 50F CTG inlet air at 
sealevel, nozzle water flow will be 22379 lb/hr and Sprint flow will be 2,206 
lb/hr. Our S&S guarantee says +/- 20% on nozzle flow, no info on possible 
+/-% on Sprint - I will ask S&S for clarification ASAP. Cooling tower water 
consumption obviously follows chilling load and cycles of 
concentration/blowdown program - water dependent!! we are conceptually using 
about 60 gpm/unit for demin.

Subject: LM6000 - Summary of 2/28/00 Discussion with Enron


Attached are our notes from the discussion we had yesterday on your LM6000
units:

COSTS
     Each unit contains the following cost breakdown ($13.5m base unit,
     $0.45m bank fee, $0.31m carrying charge, $0.45m Enhanced Sprint
     upgrade, and $62,000 cooler)

     Other Options that are not applicable to UAE: Dual Fuel $280k ea.,
     chiller system ~$1.12M ea. @ 2200 tons with two cell tower

DELIVERABLES
UAE needs to send water quality data to Enron.

Enron to provide heat balance and water balance information for the units.
Information to include guaranteed performance values adjusted for site 
elevation
and various ambient conditions, water consumption and discharge data, and
cooling tower requirements. Water consumption to include water injection for 
NOx
control, Sprint water requirements, and cooling tower makeup water.

ADDITIONAL POINTS

- WATER QUALITY FOR INJECTION: if operating greater than 1000 hrs., short
payback on permanent RO/mixed bed system
- CHILLING: with Enhanced Sprint, chilling reduced from ~2000 tons to ~800 
tons
- WATER BALANCE: water demand assumed to be 60 gallons/min per machine for E.
Sprint and NOX control
- DESIGN: UAE center line of 58' exceeds Enron minimum of 52'

     Let us know if we overlooked something or if you have any changes

Ben, please find attached below the preliminary O&M cost estimate for RPU's 
O&M services to mobilize and operate the 1 x LM6000 peaking facility to be 
situated in Rochester, Minnesota.   As we discussed, it assumes that 
Rochester Public Utilities has no existing staff and infrastructure in the 
area, but if this assumption should change, then Mobilization and annual 
Operating fixed O&M could be reduced as a result of leveraging existing RPU 
staff and facilities. Please review it and consider its accuracy to be +/- 
25%. Call if you have any questions.

Tom:  please find results on a Florida study paid for by ENA.  I look forward 
to getting your comments on this in relation to the ICF studies for 
Louisiana, Missouri and maybe Chicago (plus the West coast).

His data was LHV. roughly multiply by 1.11 to get HHV. For some reason 
several of the ENA proposals used LHV, so I though that LHV maybe usual for 
ENA deals.

If you are modeling a long term Enron owned deal then we should model 
degradation on heat rate (Santee Cooper, ReBox). If it is a EPC directly to a 
host (ElectriCities, Springfield, City of Austin), the sale would be new & 
clean but we would model our three year power transaction with just the 
initial heat rate degradation. You and I ought to look at the degradation 
curve that most closely matches and eyeball the year 1, 2 and 3 average 
degradation.

How 'bout in the morning - you pick the time - I have an 11AM tech meeting.

Thanx Bruce

Subject: Heat rate and Capacity table

Bernstein's model has a table that provide the heat rate and capacity based 
on ISO/90 degrees, chiller/no chiller, gas compression, etc. I am not sure 
whether I should go with these numbers, but I know the heat rate is off 
because I heard that the heat rate is 10,300 HHV instead of 9,300 HHV (unless 
Bernstein's model is in HHV, which I was told was not).

I got your message about not modeling capacity degradation. Should we still 
model heat rate degradation?

Please tell me when you would be available to discuss further. Thanks.

This is a revised Plano we did late yesterday. It was adjusted from Lowell, 
Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead 
form.

Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:

Homestead had dual fuel     +4M
Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M
Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M
Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M
Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M
Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M
Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital 
cost but does change $/kW)

Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a 
union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and 
construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the 
cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours 
for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.

New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we 
dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of 
million.

Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. 

These summaries should not be passed around.

Bruce

Edith,

- Substation location: Sayerville
- Gas: Transco Zone 6 (no additional cost for LDC)
- Unit contingent call
- 97% availability: It should be OK since we can assume 97% during summer 
time and 90~93% during non-summer time, for example.

Could you get the pricing for following scenario based on above assumption?

Flat and annual capacity payment for 3 and 5 year
With 16 hour block and 4 hour block

Please call me, if it doesn't make sense.

Tom,

Structuring got back to us with scenario analysis on different deal terms. 
Here is the summary.

Levelized capacity payment (starting 6/1/02)
10 yr deal (Best term)
 - @mid curve: $6.21/kw-mo
 - @offer curve: $9.84/kw-mo
12 yr deal
 - @mid curve:  $6.23/kw-mo (due to curve shift since last time, compared to 
$6.10)
 - @offer curve: $9.90/kw-mo (due to curve shift since last time, compared to 
$9.65) 

Levelized capacity payment (starting 6/1/03)
8 yr deal (Best term)
 - @mid curve:  $5.98/kw-mo
 - @offer curve: $9.69/kw-mo
11 yr deal
 - @mid curve:  $6.04/kw-mo
 - @offer curve: $9.81/kw-mo 

This result comes mainly from upward shaping gas curve. Although I don't know 
exactly what pricing the trade will give to us for 8yr deal starting 6/1/03 
(best term), I can get the quote, if you want. Please see attached 
spreadsheet for complete analysis. Can we think of any other optionality 
other than term play? Let's sit down when you have time.

I am sending via fed ex a copy of the following info on Boston Gas/Colonial:

1. 11x17 map showing Tennessee routing through Colonial system
2. 8x14 map showing the various upgrades under discussion w/Boston Gas
3. recent information from Boston Gas on capacity/delivery pressure from BG.


Our understanding/expectation is that Tennessee will be increasing its line
pressure to accomadate potential back hauls now that Maritimes is tied in.  
The
expected pressure on TGP is expected to rise over 600 psi.  This will have a 
big
impact on deliverability.  Colonial serves ULP by drawing from Tennessee at
Tewksbury, and also has a LNG facility at that site.  In order to ensure that
LNG can always be injected into their system, BG needs to regulate pressure to
no more than 600psi at the city gate.  Currently the line is running from 
300psi
to 600psi throughout the year.

Can you confirm our assumptions?

We are looking at the various options, but clearly option 3 looks best.  We 
will
be sending follow up questions tomorrow on quality of service (pressure drop,
"firm" service), throughput charges, and other clarifications.

We are asking BG for a meeting date next week, on either March 29 or 30; we
would like ENA to join us in these negotiations.  Let us know if these dates
work for you.

Lets discuss tomorrow once you receive this information.

Subject: Retail Short update

Thomas,

Ben and I had a meeting with Don on Tuesday. Please see below for the summary 
of meeting:

ENA would sell to an IPP (AES or Calpine) a combination of EES short position 
and peaking turbines.

ENA would generate profit from;
 1. spread between buying power from the IPP and selling it to EES at premium 
- will be very thin
 2. having a call option on the peaking plant for the portion of excess 
capacity of the plant
 3. fees from EES or/and IPP for providing/arranging capacity/off-taker
 4. better project financing by leveraging up more and having lower debt 
cost, which would be possible by having off-taker (EES) - Not quite sure yet.

Next steps/Assumptions;
 1. Assume equity IRR of 12% after tax
 2. Match assets to EES load curve
 3. Dispatch assets into market when not to meet load @ENA curve ("RevenueM")
 4. Calculate transfer price to meet load ("RevenueL") to meet equity return 
objectives of 12%
 5. Compare "RevenueL" to EES's market position
 6. Find Scaler value (option value from volatility)
 7. Calculate book earning for bid package
 --> We try to have work of 1 to 4 done by Thursday (2/24). Next meeting with 
Don is scheduled on Thursday.

Regarding our starting point of NY East, EES has short position ranging from 
0 MW to 126 MW in NY East region for next 11 years. I attached Excel file 
which shows an analysis of NY East including load graph.

To read EES data correctly, see the below definition.
 - WD: weekdays, WE: weekends.
 - Each 4 hour block number shows average load for 4 hour block, so actual 
peak load is higher than that.

Idea of sharing data with East Coast Power: Don does not mind if we 
distribute EES data internally within Enron, but he does not want data to go 
to Elpaso. He does not know Brad Alford.

Rich,

In working through our analysis for the revised proposal to Lincoln, I had the
following questions:

1.  In Lincoln's cost estimate of $545/kw, did this include SCR's?

2. Under taxable financing, what interest rate and repayment period would
Lincoln normally find acceptable?


Any input you could provide would be appreciated.


Thanks

Ben, please find attached revision two to the UAE - Lowell, Massachusetts 
LM6000 simple cycle peaking facility, which is to be located at an existing, 
staffed cogen facility. 

The second revisions are due to the following changes in assumptions:
1.  Further reduced the staffing costs due to no allocation of labor being 
assumed from existing plant to peaking plant and the addition of only ONE 
tech to cover the expansion O&M (per your discussion with UAE). 
2.  Restated the Annual Routine Maintenance costs components of FOM and VOM 
to 75% FOM and 25% VOM.



Please call if you have questions or want to discuss further.

regards, Scot

Thomas,

I talked to Scott shortly this afternoon. I was confused between his idea and 
Ben's model. As it is clear from Scott's proposal letter to Calpine, Enron 
would enter into a short-term tolling agreement to buy power from Calpine. 
Ben's economic model for 20 year is to understand Calpine's position, so that 
we could bid reasonably and properly. Sorry about the previous email. I think 
I started my first work very nicely. Thank you. Jinsung

Subject: Calpine Update

Thomas,

Here is a quick update for Calpine project.

1. Ben and I had a meeting with Scott this morning. Basic idea is to have 3 
and 5 year tolling agreement with Calpine and sell to the market after the 
expiration of the  agreement.

2. Ben prepared a preliminary model. Scott's target unlevered equity IRR is 
8.5% ~ 9%. Key value driver will be a capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 or 
5 years, which we will charge to Calpine. As soon as we get VOM from EE&CC, 
we will ask Structuring group to get the capacity payment for 3 and 5 years.

3. Things to be done
 - 3 and 5 year capacity payment to get 8.5% ~ 9% IRR of unlevered equity
 - 20 year power curve (capacity and energy) for Eastern PJM. We got gas 
curve.
 - VOM

I think this idea could be good if Calpine is willing to pay more than what 
we see for next 3 or 5 year Eastern PJM pool price, and/or we can leverage up 
more by taking advantage of 3 or 5 year tolling agreement. This is just my 
thought. Please correct me, if I am wrong. I will continue to work on the 
model with Ben and I will talk to Scott to find out more. Thank you.

Jinsung Myung

I was informed today by Rochester that they will not be working with Enron 
(or General Electric) on the LM-6000 Project.  The following are key points:


1.  Based on a GE evaluation of the site, the total net output of a new 
LM-6000 with Sprint Package is 42.2 Mw at average site conditions (79 degrees 
@ 1,006').

2.  Rochester had initially thought they would need 25 Mw and Enron could 
re-market the balance until Rochester's load growth utilized the balance.  
Rochester had initially considered an LM-2500 (25 Mw) and was not in favor of 
a larger machine becasue they thought the incremental 20-25 megawatts would 
cost in the $6MM to $8MM range.  Enron's proposal absorbed Rochester's risk 
of the incremental megawatts and Rochester was very interested in our 
concept.   Subsequent to our discussions with Rochester and providing a 
couple of proposals, the formal bidding process on the turbines indicated 
that the cost of the incremental Megawatts above their 25 Mw requirement was 
only approximately $1.4MM.  In fact, the cost of the last 10 Mw was only $1MM.

3.  Rochester choose to utilize the Pratt & Whitney FT-8 (Twin Pak) turbine.  
This machine yields 52 Mw (net) at site conditions and the extra 10 Mw over 
the 42 Mw provided by the LM-6000 was only an incremental $1MM.  Rochester 
says the cost of the 52 Mw will be approximately $13.1 MM or $253/Kw.  
Installation cost would be additional. (Note: ENA's bid for the LM-6000 at 42 
Mw was $14MM and GE was at $14.2MM

4.  Rochester's board instructed them not to enter into any long term 
arrangments where they would have to sign long term PPA's etc.  Rochester 
will look to have the P&W turbine installed and will market the additional 
Megawatts on a day to day and month to month basis.


Thanks to everyone for their efforts on this prospect.  Please pass the above 
information on to anyone who would benefit from this technical and 
competitive feedback.


Oscar

Thomas,

Here is a Calpine deal summary.

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw/month) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, dispatch, and cite of the plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Money making scenario: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of 
ENA curve.

I think it will be helpful if Scott or Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so 
that we can talk to Structuring group. If someone just needs to have Eastern 
PJM curve, we can try to get from Structuring group. Thank you.

Along with my conversations about the Calvert City projects, I also spoke to 
Paul Burdick about the following:

1.  Putting a peaker expansion at AES's announced Sayreville, N.J. plant.  He 
indicated that they would be interested but that there was an issue with 
transmission cue spots.  I asked if there was a certain maximum size that 
would allow for a quick interconnection.  He was going to check?  Do we know 
of any exceptions?

2.  I mentioned that we were developing a market based LD insurance product 
to Paul.  I walked him through the basics of mark-to-market accounting.  He 
was extremely interested.  He says that they have 4 tolling agreements that 
they would be interested in applying the product to (I believe that the 
agreements are all with Williams;  one of the agreements I believe already 
calls for market based LDs).  I told him that we would organize a 
presentation shortly.

allocated costs for common facilities, operating/admin expenses and staff at 
the UAE plant to be added to the incremental expenses that are estimated to 
occur as a result of the plant addition. Please review it and consider its 
accuracy to be +/- 25%. Call if you have any questions.

Please review the attached O&M estimate for the Lowell, Massachusetts 4 x 
LM6000 peaking facility to be situated at an existing UAE cogen plant. UAE 
will own and operate the plant and ENA will have option on the output for 
about 3 to 5 years. The O&M cost estimate shown assumes the hire of 2 O&M 
techs to cover the LM6000 plant for the 2 peak period shifts. Current staff 
at UAE plant is reported as 7 total (including admin) which seems low for a 
cogen, so I've shown the addition of 2 techs. It assumes an allocation of 
some existing labor and admin/operating costs from the existing plant, but in 
no case is the "annual total" for the fixed costs more than 1/2 of what we 
could do it for ourselves if it was "stand alone". Maintenance and chemicals 
are shown as variable. The fees are shown for what we used for the Wilton 
Center Expansion ($40M - Mob; $80M - Annual Ops).



thanks, Scot

Ben and Jinsung,

We have not had time to pass this information by the traders.  If we resolve 
the issues regarding location, unit contingency, etc., we can get a better 
number from the traders.  For now, these are indicative prices only.  Once we 
understand the deal better, we can talk to the traders and get a firmer 
price.  Also, Jim Fallon has requested that his traders receive a term sheet 
prior to agreeing to a price.

Here is the information you requested, based on the assumptions sent in the 
e-mail below:

Further assumptions:
180 MW
Priced at PJM East hub, no cost is added for any transmission
Must be called in 16 hour blocks
Total start costs: $1200 per start ($300 per turbine)
No escalation in VOM
95% availability

3 year capacity:  $3.80 kw/mo
5 year capacity:  $3.74 kw/mo

This is to verify our meetings tomorrow on the following:


1.  Lincoln Electric (Russ/Ben) 10:00 a.m. to noon (conference room tba)
2.  Rochester, Mn (Russ/Ben) same as above
3.  Madision, WI (Erin/Mathew) 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. (conference room tba)


For each opportunity, I would like to line out a deal structure and formulate 
a base case and subsets for modeling.  I am totally open to ideas and input.  

I would also like to take our concepts and review with Geoff Allen (MAPP Mid 
Marketer) tomorrow afternoon as a cursory review.

If there are questionaires, input forms, etc. that are required for modeling 
efforts, we want to make sure we cover that as well.  In addition, we may 
want to have credit begin a review to verify the parties are creditworthy.  I 
know that Lincoln and Madision are highly rated, but I am not sure about 
Rochester.

Due to the short fuse on each of these, we need to be prepared to turn 
proposals around in 5 to 7 business days.

Thanks

Oscar

Ben, please find attached a summary of the spread option value for 4 LM 
6000's for UAE deal.ts. Implicit in the valuation is complete flexibility in 
dispatching the plant in 8-hour blocks. The power price curve used is the bid 
curve (these are only indicative prices and not the actual prices at which 
traders would trade). We used the Mid curve for Gas. The gas pricing includes 
NYMEX + Tennessee Z6 Basis + Tennessee Z6 Index. The heat rates were based on 
your input. If you have any questions you could call me up at x30678.

Thanks
Gautam

Best data we have for a 7FA simple cycle is the East Coast Power Linden #7 
that NEPCO did.

EPC cost for single unit was $63,000,000 based on a $34,000,000 7FA cost. 
Scope was for 7FA with CO catalyst and stack, generator breaker, main power 
transformer, 4160 V switchgear, 480 switchgear, small control room, light oil 
tank and pumps for backup fuel, natural gas heater.

Best data we have for 7FA combined cycle is Pittsburg.

This is better data than what Ben Rogers got on Paducah. I was able to get a 
better CCTG model run so performance is better than my wild guess Monday. EPC 
cost is roughly same basis, did do some adds and subtracts based on your 
memo. May not have captured everything but should be in the ball park. 
Numbers should be useful for conceptual screening proformas to see if we are 
in ballpark, we should do a tasking letter and a complete conceptual 
scope/performance/estimate if you need any numbers that we might base 
something we put on an offer table. Obviously not reviewed or approved by 
anybody.

Ben

I will rerun your data in same form for Paducah - should look better

Thanx Bruce

Subject: Request for 7FA estimate

Bruce,

Per my voicemail, I am requesting an estimate for 7FA capital costs and heat 
rate for a proposed expansion of an IPP acquisition. We will be putting 
together a model to come up with an all-in capital cost ($/kw) for a single 
cycle, and possibly combined cycle facility with 1-3 7FAs and 0-1 steam 
turbines.  The maximum MW of the site would be approximately 500 MW, so we 
would like to consider the following configurations: 

1, 2, or 3 gas turbines single cycle, for a total of 170, 340, or 510 MW.
2 gas turbines plus one steam turbine in combined cycle, for a total of 510 
MW. 

Here are some specifics about the facility:
located in Lakewood NJ (east PJM)
primary fuel is natural gas, with a back up fuel of heavy fuel oil
expansion on site of current 238 MW combined cylce facility (2 ABB GT 11N1, 
w/ ABB KT Steam turbine )
for option 1: peaking facility, 25% dispatch
for option 2: baseload facility, 90% dispatch
total capacity of pipe is 150 MMcf, and current project uses only 30 MMcf 
(e.g. sufficient gas pipeline)

>From my discussions with Ben Rogers, I understand that the numbers were 
approximately $34-36 MM/turbine and installed capital cost was $571/kwh for 
27FAs in combined cycle, at a heat rate of 7300.

Please let me know if this information is enough to get an estimate of the 
turbine costs, heat rate, VO&M, start-up costs, and fuel requirements.  
Please give me a call when you get this so we can pick a time to discuss the 
project further. 

Regards,
Tracee

I forgot to say one thing. Spread option values for year 2001 were changed 
reflecting starting date of 6/1/01. Also change ICAP value, which is 
$1.00/kw-mo for 6 months in 2001.

Ben,

Look at the model, focusing on assmuption and option pages. Give a call if 
you have any comment.

Ben,

Here is one version of the Doyle model.  There is an earlier version which 
has a simpler IDC calculation (based on percentage draws), I can send that 
one to you as well if you need it.  Let me know if you have any questions.
