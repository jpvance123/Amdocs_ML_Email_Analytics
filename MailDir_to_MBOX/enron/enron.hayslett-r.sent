Subject: Re: Space Planning

To begin the process of thinking about what is needed to plan our space for 
the future, we need to pull together some very simple information from each 
of you.   Please provide the following to Rod Hayslett or to me as soon as 
possible:

Number of work spaces by category:
 Office
 Cubicle/work station - high walls
 Cubicle/work station - low walls

Number of additional work spaces (visitors, auditors, etc.)

Number of Conference/Team Rooms:
 Small (4-6 person)
 Medium (7-12 person)
 Large (more than 12 - please specify)

File Rooms: Specify the linear footage of file space required and/or list 
special requirements for maps, etc.

Special:  Model Office
  Computer Rooms/Cold Rooms
  Map Tables and/or walls
  Writable walls
  Video Conference Equipment/Connections
  Other

Also, please identify one person from your organization that can be used for 
coordination purposes. For instance, Rod Hayslett will assign Kathy Campos 
for his section.

Thanks for your help in this effort!

Before I answer this email, thought I would confirm with you how we intend 
collecting and distributing the $180K  rebate for the pre-buy program.  The 
methanol plant contributed $300K toward the $1.500K goal.

Shirley,

Now that we have discussed it, I understand sufficiently to be confident that 
it's good all around for us to participate.  It will alter our procurement 
timing a little if we do delay our overhauls to next year (we would be buying 
the long lead, high dollar stuff this quarter even if we do delay), but it 
seems clear that it is in Enron's best interest to make those slight changes. 

I will let our controller and Finance Manager know what's up just to keep 
them informed.  They may be helpful to us in figuring out how to get the 
rebate to come into GPG through Enron Methanol Company or Enron Clean Fuels.  
I will admit to very limited knowlege of how those transactions take place.

I will also let Debbie Hinkle (our buyer, 281/882-4232) know to expect your 
call about prices we have been receiving from Cooper.

Thanks again, 

Steve

Steve,

Per my voice mail today.

We would like to offer your operation the opportunity to receive 12% rebate 
on parts purchased from Cooper.  We have prepaid $1.5MM for parts and will 
receive a 12% rebate.

Other parts of GPG have used about $600K of the pre-buy and we would like to 
role your shutdown requirements into the program.

Please call me as soon as possible and I will answer any questions you have.

Look forward to talking to you. 
Regards,
Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson

Subject: Lease Option on Trailblazer

To recap our recent discussion, my understanding was that you were looking 
for an Enron or NBP entity to serve as the lessor in a lease financing 
transaction that would be offered as an option in the pending EAMR bid for 
the Trailblazer construction project.  Since such transaction would need to 
be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors 
(depending upon the structure) the expected returns will not justify the 
balance sheet impact on Northern Border Partners if this entity were to 
function as lessor.  Furthermore, I have assumed that this conclusion also 
holds true from Enron's perspective given their strategy of reserving balance 
sheet capacity for higher return projects.

Since the bid parameters do not specify a lease requirement, Trailblazer may 
already have funding in place.  If not, EAMR could insert language in the bid 
that they or their designee would arrange lease financing for the project 
upon selection of EAMR as the winning bidder.  At that point, we would work 
with commercial banks or major leasing companies to develop a cost-effective 
financing transaction.

I hope this addresses your questions regarding the feasibility of such a 
transaction, but please call me at x7843 in Omaha if you wish to discuss 
further.  Good luck with your bid!

was discussed at this years management conference in San Antonio, listing=

If you have not dealt with folders please give me a call and I can assist y=

FYI.    This close date is of large significance to GPG as we are going to be 
asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the 
financials.     This variance from what we thought was a "Common Design" is a 
huge deal, in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in 
getting agreement within GPG to go forward as it was an improvement that we 
could see had value.   I agreed to and "stacked hands" with all on the 
"Common Design", yet somehow there has been a failure to deliver the "Common 
Design".   I just want to make sure that the two of you are aware of my 
position on this issue.

Subject: Risk Document Information


I think Steve was planning to add my comments on impact of prolonging GPG 
close to the risk document, but  I did not see it in the document I edited 
yesterday.  To restate, it needs to be noted under org impact that GPG's 
close is going from 5 to 8+ days which is unacceptable.  We have the 
impression that there is not sufficient desire/potential across the BUs to do 
what is necessary to get it down to the committed 3 days that we all agreed 
to at the ASE.  We view this as a showstopper and will hold the  project and 
COE and our own team accountable for meeting that committment by the end of 
the year if not sooner.  It seems like we should already have a plan in place 
on how we are going to achieve that.  This was a design signoff exception too.

Also, info for risk document below.  My question below was taken from the 
risk doc and responded to for actions that have been taken..

If you can, please update for these two items before next distribution

Thanks

Subject: Preliminary 2001 Floor Plan


The Market Service Team has reviewed their requirements for the proposed 
relocation of ETS within the Enron building.  Under this plan, Gas Control 
would not move from their current location and the Market Service Teams would 
be in close proximity to Transactional Marketing and Facility Planning.  
Julia's intent is to have discussion with Danny to make sure the 
organizations are aligned to support the commercial teams. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.

Dave needs to step up to the plate and start delivering some new and creative 
solutions for outstanding issues.  He has the capabilities.   It seems he 
tends to manage too much by wandering around and not taking the lead.

I fully support Barney's rating, but could see both Dave and Larry's ratings 
being on the lower edge of the recommended ratings.

I will do all I can to shore up the organization by placing some expectations 
for improvements before the whole group and dividing up the accountabilities 
accordingly.

I fully support what you have recommended.

These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some

I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new

this is a part of the Revenue Management project.

Subject: ETS Risk System

Rod,
Caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the Risk System so I wanted to 
go ahead and respond since Steve is out this week.

I don't think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed, 
but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs. using an 
Enron Risk System.  We did more research and got the other groups involved so 
that they would understand our decision.  I believe everyone is now 
comfortable with our purchase decision.

In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because 
we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche 
and Ernst & Young.  These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have 
audited this application and have actually participated in numerous 
implementations.  Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable 
Resources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 
6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for 
Tractabel.  After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we 
felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit 
concerns.  Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be 
established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of 
those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the 
product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new 
business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. 

Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all 
the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year 
maintenance.  This cost does represent a very limited implementation with 
only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no 
electronic interfaces or data conversion.  The assumption is that initially 
the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost 
justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as 
well.  The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year.  We 
did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original 
cost of the Revenue Management RAROC.  Let me know if you have any other 
questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to 
completing the contract.  We are hoping to get this signed and the project 
underway next week.  Thanks.

Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such 
should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen 
nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC 
on that date, out of the office.

I do not see why not.  I would prefer that we have shipped the computers 
before there is any announcement.  Do you have an exact date?  If your 
announcement is before we actually ship the computers, which hopefully will 
be this week, then I would just say something like NALMP has established a 
new relationship with Enron Transportation Services, the pipeline subsidiary 
of the Enron Corporation.  If your announcement is after we ship then I would 
feel more comfortable mentioning some of the details.

Let me know what you think.

The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to 
adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have 
to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to 
do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed.

Subject: Revenue Management Expenditures

While talking with Kim and Martha a question was asked  on capital budgeting 
for Revenue Management..  The question has to do with carrying over 
previously  approved dollars from 2000 to 2001.

The facts ($millions) :

2000 Revenue Management Budget:

$5.7 - Original RM Phase one approval
$(1.0)  In July 00, this amount was approved to spend in 2001 (in the 2001 
budget as a line item)
$4.7    Expected expenditures in 2000 for Phase one.


$(1.0) Current assessment of money not needed for Phase one deliverables 
(estimated, may still change)
$3.7     Amount  approved  with current work-orders
$  .8     Possible amount to be carried over and spent in 2001 
$2.9     Phase one amount to be spent in 2000


2001 Revenue Management Budget:

$ 1.0   Phase one approved carryover  (in 2001 budget)
$  .8  Estimated additional carryover   (not currently in 2001 budget)
$3.0 Phase two   ( in 2001 budget  in the Marketing Pool)
$ 4.8  Total to be  spent in 2000

Question:  
Since the $.8 was approved and is covered in the existing work-orders, can 
this be additive to the 2001 budget without any further approval - even 
though it is not currently a line item in the 2001 budget?  Or does the  $.8 
have to be offset against the Marketing Pool?

If this $.8 does go against the Marketing pool of $15.0 million, will the 
revenues generated from Revenue Management  reduce the revenues generated 
from the pool?  In other words If the capital dollars from the pool are 
reduced because of RM will the revenues also be reduced?

Attached is list of the outstanding insurance claims provided to us by Risk 
Management.  As I indicated to Rod yesterday, I have been informed that the 
premiums that were paid this year were $15,000,000 and given the claims 
submitted at $43,000,000, Corp is looking for a way to mitigate anticipated 
rising premium costs.   They are looking very hard at Hawkin's Audit Program 
to help them out.  As this list indicates, International assets should bear 
the brunt of future costs.  The Transwestern train derailment will be about 
$700,000 ($200k for repair and $500k for buisness interruption), both of 
which will ulitmately be reimbursed by the railroad.

Rod,

Here are the credit rating ratios you requested for evaluating a potential 
deal.

In the spreadsheet I have given you two sets of figures for the year 2000 -- 
one set represents what was shown to the Board of Directors in December, the 
second set is the current set of "rating agency targets" for the year.

Please call me if you have any questions -- or need assistance formulating an 
analysis.

I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to 
your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the 
business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and 
solves the fiduciary problem.

Subject: Re: O&M Fees at Interconnects  

For O&M fees at interconnects NBPL has been charging the customer an 
estimated incremental cost, which under the cost of service tariff was 
credited back to O&M (where the incremental costs were originally charged).  
We are definitely going to change this now.

In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining 
a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been 
involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).  In that case, a 
small amount of O&M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.  

In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on 
NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the 
amounts be left at NBPL.  The main reasons are accounting ease, avoidance of 
fiduciary issues, and customer relations.

In other similar situations where Operations has had an opportunity to 
provide a service for a fee, we have been looking to EAMR as the entity to do 
the work.  Does the NBPL sitiuation preclude EAMR from taking on this role?  
I would assume, unless there has been a change, that given the fact that NBPL 
does not have any employees it would be difficult for NBPL to provide the 
service.

Subject: O&M Fees at Interconnects

The issue of O&M fees at new interconnects has been raised by several 
customers.  A meeting to discuss this issue and how Operations will determine 
these fees, is scheduled for Monday, December 18, on your calendar.  Your 
input is very important at this meeting.

Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue 
and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.  NBPL has been asked 
to renegotiate fees (PGL&C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1 
year (Harvest States).  NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of 
line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).  We need to 
agree on a decision from both a business and an operations perspective.  
Currently, we have estimated operating fees at interconnects where we charge 
a fee and charge a standard monthly fee of $2,000 per month with the 
exception of two interconnects.  With the tariff changes, operating fees will 
not automatically be recovered in the future.  How are these operating fees 
going to be tracked and charged?  Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers 
the same fee?  Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a 
cost of doing business?  These questions need to be answered at the meeting.

Thanks!

Rod,

After receiving feedback from both yourself and Phil Lowry through George 
Wasaff, we will cancel this meeting. Originally Peter Buettgen and I were  
anticipating the need to share the details of our process assessment strategy 
with you prior to our kickoff. However, it has been pointed out that Morris 
has been identified as the lead player and has responsibility for all 
decision making. Therefore we will be working directly with Morris and will 
not burden you with details unless Morris feels appropriate.

Thank you for your support and commitment in the completion of the iBuyit 
process assessment.
John

Since ETS has third party debt on it's books, the debt and cost of carry will 
be excluded from the calculation so as not to double count.  

Rick wants it to actualy be booked.  I lean towards just calculating it and 
not actually make entries (I know that entries will cause all sorts of 
additional issues).   Nothing has been formalized yet.

What do we do with debt on the books of the entities?  Ignore it?   And my

Subject: Capital Charge and Calculating Return on Invested Capital

Over the last few months, we have been working on a new methodology to 
measure and report business unit's retrurns on invested capital.   Several 
different variations were considered, and I am glad to report that Skilling, 
Causey and Fastow have approved the process outlined here.

Simply stated (with an example shown below):  Return on equity will be 
calculated based on a pre-determined debt/equity structure.  Business unit 
capital will include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet uses of 
capital and business unit's will be charged for the cost of their debt at 
Enron's cost of funds.  Business unit's should focus on improving their 
return on equity over time.

______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________


______________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________


This metric will not replace other targets (i.e., IBIT and Funds Flow).  

We are currently working to overlay this approach to the submitted 2001 
Plans.  If you have questions, please contact myself or Mike Deville.

These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some 
specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might 
lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on

Subject: Trip to Wessex

I'm not sure what you have heard back from the crew in Bristol/Bath, but I 
found them to be very interested in achieving maximum success.    There was a 
lot of learning on my part, but I'm now more convinced than ever that Wessex 
is very much like our gas pipeline business.    Even to the fact that the 
internal regulatory types don't believe the regulators will approve it.     I 
have offered continuing assistance as needed (in fact have a conference call 
setup for tomorrow).    I was able to give them the benefit of my experiences 
and tried to create analogies to our experiences here.   In some cases I'm 
sure it made a difference, in others the group may actually be in front of 
some of our thinking.    I think I can see an opportunity to expand the 
thinking on both sides of "the pond" in the regulated businesses  with just 
some simple contacts and have promised to help them at least start 
conversations with more counterparts in the pipeline group.    

Let me know how you want me to charge you the travel costs.     I can submit 
the claim here and bill you or I can submit the claim to you.

We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be 
billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take 
it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will 
take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be 
done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the 
year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or 
Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.   
Tracy has the point on this one.

Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments?

Subject: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001

Rod--

I never heard back from you on this airplane accounting issue for year 2001.  
Any thoughts on timing as to who we can work with to finalize by year end?   
Can we work with Dave Waymire here in Omaha??

Also,  there was an article in  this past  Sunday's World Herald that   FASB 
has reversed its position on merger accounting and will not require firms to 
amortize Goodwill  over time and  write it off against current income of a 
merged company.  In addition, the new plan would eliminate the  "pooling of 
interest"  restrictions and allow merged companies to sell off unwanted 
assets prior to the two year waing period now required.  I'm not sure if this 
revision would be applicable to mergers which occurred before this FASB 
revision or not.  

Do you have any insights on this???

Thank You.

Subject: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001

Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!

way to allocate costs however is to do so according to the benefits 
received.      That way no one can argue that they didn't get the same 
deal.    If the deal makes sense from a group standpoint, then it should make 
sense from an individual pipeline standpoint.

Project economics need to be looked at in 2 ways.     1) The project 
economics on a stand alone basis and then 2) the more accurate approach of 
what does the project do to the entity (the with and without approach).     
The accounting return in the second approach has become actually the more 
important measure of success.

When we meet on Friday after Rod's meeting, should we also address the 
pipeline "cost allocation" issue if we have to continue do project economics 
by pipeline in addition to by ETS?

It's a bit difficult to distinguish capital vs. o&m from your list below, 
since you've used the same item description in both categories ie., 
"Resources" . I would be more than happy to develop a specific list or matrix 
with you.
Additional  "discretionay" items to consider are overheads, perhaps AFUDC, 
and perhaps indirect allocations (ie corporate allocations). 

There is more than capital and o&m to consider when developing a 
comprehensive project economic analysis or accounting recap.

>From an economic standpoint its critically important to identify all of the 
cash flows and their timing, both "in" (savings) and "out", and not worry 
about accounting. From an accounting standpoint; and if an ORR is necessary 
its important to identify
the accounting flow of a project which will always vary from the cash flow. 
Components may include:

Initial Capital,
Ongoing Capital
Overheads and AFUDC, if applied
Net O&M, direct and indirect
'Book"Deperciation
Tax Depreciation
Advalorem 
Current taxes
Deferred taxes
"Capital" allocations

In addition to the DCF return, I believe Rod wants us to determine the 
Operating Rate of Return (ORR).  If a new project is to replace an old 
project, we also need the net book value of the old project.  I am forwarding 
my September e-mail on Project Evaluation to you all.

Pretty good.       I would suggest you run these by Jim Saunders (to check on 
what should be capitalized and what shouldn't) and by Denis Tu (to see if he 
has run across any other things you might have left out in his experience).

As to the question "How will we account for the additional O&M budget dollars 
which could start hitting the O&M budget in the same year the project is 
completed?" that's pretty easy, they aren't authorized to be spent.    If the 
dollars for the support of projects aren't budgeted or specifically 
authorized in the project funding document, then something must be cut to 
allow for the dollars to be spent, or we will have to request additional 
funding to carry out the program.    When we do that, unless we are beating 
budget somewhere else, it would appear that we would not meet our goal and 
therefore the bonus pool of dollars would be reduced directly as a result of 
the additional costs.    (Bonus pool = about 2.5% of net income.)    This is 
why it's so important to get the numbers right as soon as is practical.

Subject: Project Economics

Steve asked me to put together something for everyone to follow in regards to 
Projects ASAP.  If my understanding is correct, to do the economics on a 
project, all costs must be included, ie. capital dollars, O&M dollars, and 
ongoin O&M dollars for the estimated project life.
This is a sample breakdown of what I came up with:
Current year Budget
 Capital Dollars
  Hardware
  Software
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes pagers, cell phone, salaries 
and benefits, etc.
   -internal existing
   -internal additional
   -contractors existing
   -contractors additional
  Project related Expenses
  Special services (dedicated phone line while in development, etc.)
  Other

 O&M Dollars
  Training and related expenses
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes employee expenses (training, 
pagers, cell phone, salaries and benefits/taxes, etc.)
   -internal additional
   -contractors additional
  Special services
  Other

Future Years Budget
 O&M Ongoing Dollars - project life
  Hardware maintenance
  Software maintenance
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes employee expenses (training, 
pagers, cell phone, salaries and benefits/taxes,etc.)
   -internal additional
   -contractors additional
  Special services
  Other

Current and Future Years Budget
 Capital/O&M Offset Dollars - project life (savings)
  Hardware
  Software
  Hardware maintenance
  Software maintenance
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes employee expenses (training, 
pagers, cell phone, salaries and benefits/taxes, etc.)
   -internal existing
   -internal additional
   -contractors existing
   -contractors additional
  Special services
  Other

I know we did not budget O&M costs related to projects in the 2001 budget 
because it would be unknown at budget time and not known until the project is 
actually studied in detail to be recommended to be done.  How will we account 
for the additional O&M budget dollars which could start hitting the O&M 
budget in the same year the project is completed?  Once a project is 
completed it is easy to account for the additional O&M dollars in future 
budgets.  Please let me know ASAP if I am on the right track with this.  From 
what Steve stated in his staff meeting and our brief phone conversation this 
is what I came up with.   Thanks...cvb
