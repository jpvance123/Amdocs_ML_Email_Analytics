Can one of you attend a meeting at 2:00 that Ed McMichael has called to discuss the Financial Book status?  He may have some questions about the termination log.  The meeting is tentatively in the new building, 5th floor - you can check with Sara, she will also be attending.  I'm not feeling well and going home for the rest of the day.  If you need me for anything, my home number is 713-807-7242.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Notice No. 02-17
January 11, 2002


To:        NYMEX Members and Member Firms

From:	Scott Hess, Co-Chairman, Marketing Committee
	Richard Schaeffer, Co-Chairman, Marketing Committee

Re:       2002 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo

________________________________________________________________________


The Marketing Department has been able to procure a limited number of
tickets to each performance of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo which
starts Tuesday, February 12th and runs through Sunday March 3rd (see
attached performance schedule for detail of dates, times and featured
entertainers).  Each performance includes a variety of rodeo events, e.g.
calf roping, bronco riding, bull riding, barrel racing, etc.   The only
difference between shows is the featured entertainer.

These tickets are available to the entire NYMEX division members on a first
come, first served basis and can be obtained by sending a written request
(see attached application) to the Exchange's Houston office (see
instructions below).  However, in order to ensure fairness, it is requested
that requests for tickets be limited to four tickets per member or eight per
firm.  Requests above eight tickets will be considered on an availability
basis.

REQUEST FOR TICKETS PROCEDURE:

1.	All requests should be submitted to the Houston office in writing
(fax acceptable).  See attached application.

2.	All requests will be handled on a first come, first served basis and
all requests will be handled on a best effort basis.

3.	Please be sure to indicate your first and second choice.  If tickets
are unavailable for both first and second choice or no second choice is
indicated and first choice is unavailable, then NYMEX staff will attempt to
contact the member requesting tickets for instructions.  If unable to
contact member, then the order will be returned unfilled.




4.	All sections of the order form must be completed for processing.  If
the form is not completed correctly, NYMEX staff will attempt to contact the
requesting party for further instructions.  If the party cannot be reached,
then the request will be returned unfilled.

5.	The NYMEX Houston office must receive your order request by February
8th in order to allow for processing.  NYMEX staff will attempt to fill any
late orders on a best effort basis, but NYMEX is not responsible for
unfilled requests or other problems associated with late requests.

6.	Order forms must be legible and correct.  NYMEX staff will attempt
to contact the requesting party in the event of illegible or incorrect
information on the order form, but if unsuccessful, then the request will be
returned unfilled.

7.	Please limit requests to four tickets per member or eight per firm
as referenced earlier, however, NYMEX staff will attempt to accommodate all
requests as indicated in item #2 above.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

(1)  I thought you said that there were specific transactions in the U.S. entities.  I need a list of trades booked in the names of Enron Credit Inc. and Enron North America Corp.

(2)  I need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me.

(3)  I don't understand what happened with the Anker Coal position.  I know that London used that entity for the purpose of transferring this position to ECTEF Inc.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

Ifo survey may also be an overreaction. But, there is also a possibility of=
 a contraction in German Q4 growth that would put even FinMin Eichel's 0.75=

 a clear indication for a cut, the euro will come under further pressure ne=

If you will allow me to quote Sinatra's My Way; "And now the end is near and so I face the final curtain."

Just a quick note to let you all know that tomorrow, Thursday, March 7th , will be my last day here at Enron as I move further down the alphabet to a credit role at Entergy Corp.  I will forward my new information as it becomes available but for now - you can reach me at 281-360-6998 (Home Phone) and/or tmoran1961@kingwoodcable.com (Home e-mail)

I wish that it could have been a sweeter ride for all of us but it was not in the cards.  I have enjoyed working with you all and am a better person for the experience.

Best of luck to everybody !
Tom Moran



P.S.
Bonus parting points to anyone that knows who wrote "My Way"

   Subject:  Amendment to IRCEA

   Sara,

   Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
   amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently
   in
   place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
   have reviewed the definition of "Specified Swap" as defined in Part 1(2)
   of
   the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
   transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the
   amendment.

   Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the
   execution
   of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at
   270
   Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
   executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.
   Once I
   receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to
   you
   one fully executed original for your files.

   If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
   telephone number is 212-270-2673.

   Best Regards,

   Maureen Ryan

(4)  Additional Termination Events:  use of rating downgrade Part 1(i) pages 2-3]
(5)  Delivery of documents [see page 5 comments]
(6)  elimination of "non-reliance" representation [pages 7-8]
(7)  elimination of affiliate setoff [pages 8-9]
(8)  Change to definiton of "Credit Support Amount" [Annex A page 1]

I think they should have no problem with us using ours.  That is great.  Kelly must have simply forgot you were sending it.

Thanks,

Tom:

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Apparently CSFB neglected to ask us to complete the attached corporate resolution when we executed the broker agreement.  If we could fill out and forward on that would be great.

Following up on my voice mail.

Chris Calger is looking for the underlying documentation for the swap between Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp. and Chase entered into on April 9, 1999.  A similar swap was entered into between the American Public Energy Agency and Chase on the same date.

A transaction diagram for the transaction is attached for your reference.

Please call either Chris or me with any questions.

Thanks.

Trading Commission ("CFTC").  The Exchange Membership will be notified upon
receipt of CFTC approval.

A copy of the proposed rule amendments is attached.

Should you have any questions please contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608

President Bush this week declared that a new "axis of evil" - Iraq, Iran,
and North Korea - pose a deadly and unacceptable threat to the United
States. The statement was a significant expansion of the scope of the war
on terror, but there have been few details about how the United States
will deal with these nations.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/axis020131.html

What do you think of President Bush singling out these nations? Share your
thoughts.

Plus, documents found in the home of Osama bin Laden's military chief,
Mohammed Atef, spotlight specific U.S. sites, including the Capitol and
Seattle's Space Needle, sources tell ABCNEWS. Were these potential terror
targets?

Sara,

I talked with Brent Hendry late yesterday.  He would like to be e-mailed a form template called "Credit Review Sheet" because he is implementing something at his new job similar to what we have.  Who would I call to get such a form?

Thanks!
Becky

David:

Attached is a draft demand letter for nonpayment.  This form is specifically geared to the ISDA.  Please comment.  Do you think we need a "savings clause" for deals which we might inadvertently fail to mention, the date by which payment is required, or a telephone contact for questions?

We are collecting the data for a rash of these letters.  

Thanks.  Sara

Another opera channel bites the dust... must be the opera fans are too cheap for the advertisers that remain on the web.

 a high of 114.88, but today's comments from S?were not enough to stem more=

t at 135.00 and the dollar is now looking to test trendline support from th=

e, the upside is capped at 133.20 and 133.60.  JPY has benefited recently f=
rom a letup by Japanese officials chiming in unison about yen weakness. Ano=
ther point of contention this week will be whether the G7 meeting in Toront=
o and the World Economic Forum in New York become a sounding board for big =
global interests to bash the recent resurgence in the dollar against the ye=
n. Manufacturers, like GM on Wednesday, are likely to complain that the sta=
te of the economy is now about at the same level just prior to the Septembe=

he dollar was steady against European majors and recouped some of yesterday=
's losses against the pound after the US Federal Reserve kept its key inter=
est rate unchanged at 1.75% and maintained its easing bias. The positive re=
sponse by Wall Street was supportive of the dollar, especially given the re=
cent Enron ripple effects felt on Tuesday's sell off of US equities. The do=
llar also rebounded sharply after US Q4 GDP rose 0.2% q/q, beating estimate=
s of a second consecutive negative quarter. This showed the US has avoided =
a technical recession and the Fed's supportive remarks were bullish for the=

Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language amending
the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

I trust this will now close the open issues.

I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards

Daniel

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.  If
you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and we
can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore, are
not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have other
business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation
of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed
together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

   The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your relationship
   with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that relate
   to
   the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the PB
   relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

   Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
   addressed
   in the documentation as drafted.

   I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible so
   we
   can try to get this wrapped up today.

   Kind regards

   Daniel:

   Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
   conflict
   because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
   requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the Terms
   of
   Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
   Are
   you agreeing with this analysis?

   Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
   with
   the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
   (except
   for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is Enron
   Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
   Terms
   of Business in the same manner.

   Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or suggest a
   different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
   remaining
   documents.

   Thanks.

      Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
   more
      appropriate to general terms of business which principally
   contemplate
      the
      regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event of
      inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

      I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

      Daniel:

      Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the "Agreement")
      with my colleague Angela Davis.

      I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
   relating
      to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but
      were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

      (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14 of
      the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of
      arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
   OSLA)
      so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the
      Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
   courts,
      I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
      prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

      (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same manner
   as
      Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that you
      and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why shouldn't
      these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

      I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
      account documentation.  Regards.

All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the December 2001 options contract for Copper (HXZ1)
and Aluminum (OAZ1) is Tuesday, November 27, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on the recently
announced shortened trading hours.

Trading in the December 2001 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will
cease at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on November 27, 2001.  All
Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions
to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Tuesday, November 27, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Tuesday's submissions and processing will be
available on Wednesday morning November 28, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

=============================================
Jean's Choices this month
I don't usually put my own preferences out, but this month, there are some great "sleeper" wines and some excellent prices that you might miss while wandering through the 3600+ pages that are the Avalon site (Argh!! How did I do that!!)  I've been tasting wines like crazy for the last month, and some of these are really lovely, but they haven't been reviewed yet, or they are too obscure to hit the press.  So here, for what it's worth, are the wines that, as work on the website,  I type in and say to myself "I hope they find this, it's a good one!"
 
Andrew Rich Cuvee B Pinot Noir 99 $15.99
Cuvee B Pinot Noir is made from the same grapes as his regular 99 Pinot Noir, but from younger vines or graes that did not quite make the cut for his 99 blend. This is a happy mood making, easy drinking Pinot with lots of spice and soft red cherry fruit. A GREAT DEAL!http://www.oregongourmet.com/andrew-rich-cuvee-b.html 
Beaux Freres Belles Soeurs Shea 2000 $44.99 regular $49.99
The best wine from Shea Vineyard I've ever had. Incredibalievable!   A yumm bucket.
http://www.oregongourmet.com/beaux-freres-belles-soeurs-shea-2000.html 
 
Broadley Marcile Loraine 2000 $49.99
Morgan Broadley told me a restaurant's staff  that came to the winery to taste drank up his whole tasting bottle in a jiffy and I can tell you they had good reason to. This is stellar Pinot Noir in the Broadley tradition. VERY VERY LIMITED. The nose was full of truffles and bitter chocolate and a hint of licorice that I find in most of the Broadley estate wines. The flavors were layered and complex, with every kind of spice and seasoning entwined with big black fruit, cassis, plum, and blackberry. The finish went on for 5 minutes, I think. The Claudia's Choice 2000 is just as good in its own way.http://www.oregongourmet.com/Broadley-Marcile-Loraine.html 
 
Fiddlehead Pinot Noir 96 $33.99
Kathy Josephs is one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet, and she makes wonderful Pinot Noir. Based in Santa Barbara, she is better known in CA. In 1996 she started making a limited bottling of Oregon Pinot Noir, and we are so fortunate to have a supply of this wonderful wine. I tried it and it is drinking beautifully, and showing all the complexity and intriguing mystery of well made, well aged Pinot Noir. The wine has been perfectly cellared since bottling with no exposure to heat or shipping trauma.
I suggest a vertical tasting of her wines- we have the 96, 97, and 98 available. This wine is well worth a try, if only to see what well made Oregon Pinot Noir is capable of five years out.http://www.avalonwine.com/fiddlehead.htm 
 
High Pass Pinot Noir Walnut Ridge Vineyard 99 $35.99
High Pass Scheurbe Late Harvest 2000 375 ml $22.99
Dieter Boehm's vineyards are a stone's throw from Big Pink (Avalon's farm and web office) and as with Broadley (a stone's throw in a different direction), there's world class wine in the hills of the Monroe and Junction City! High Pass is the classic sleeper winery, making wines that the most experienced wine judges I know are ranking at the top of the list. Both of these wines are outstanding examples of their type. I wish I could afford to take home more of the late harvest wine- I can't pronounce it, but I sure like it. I thought is was as good as some of the $80 ice wines from Canada. And the Pinot is rich, almost buttery, with a meaty hit that would stand up well to roast leg of lamb. This could be a great choice for Easter dinner.http://www.avalonwine.com/highpass.htm 
 
Patricia Green Cellars Pinot Noir Estate 2000 $29.99
This wine tastes a lot like Beaux Freres' signature Pinot Noir, their Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir. The vineyard is right next to Beaux Freres' vineyard, so it makes sense, and Patricia is already pulling great fruit from it. In a few years, this will be the wine she is best known for. Or so I think. Huge Patty Green nose with warm, luscious black cherry and cassis hits along with a dense, earthy undertone that is rich and pleasant. The flavors are of dark blak fruits, spices like cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, a hint of violets and roses, and elegant complexity. The finish is long and silky. Patty is one of my favorite winemakers- her jolly disposition and passion for wine show through in all of her delicious wines. http://www.oregongourmet.com/product1939.html 
 
Thomas Pinot Noir 99 $29.99
He makes very little wine, and some vintages there is no wine as he does not find the grapes up to his standards. When he does drop by with wine, we dance in delight. A wine made with passion and great finesse, age for up to 10 years, classicly Burgundian, with layers and layers of fruit, spice, char and oak, and exotic hints of rose, cinnamon and incense.

fter Bush Visit by Jes Black  Market Holiday  The euro came under renewed p=
ressure today as the European Monetary Union's credibility came back into q=
uestion. EUR/USD fell 1/3 cent from a day's high of 87.40 to a low of 87.11=
 after trading most of the day in a tight 10 pip range. First to knock the =
euro was an unexpectedly pessimistic EMU report from Sweden that warned a m=
onetary union area may not become a stable low inflation, low interest rate=
 environment as hoped. Therefore, it is not certain that the euro will be a=
 stable "hard currency" area. Moreover, the report highlighted the latent t=
hreat of diverging national growth dynamics within the union.  This brings =
to mind Germany's dilemma of needing a boost from either lower interest rat=
es or higher fiscal spending. But the European Central Bank has been unwill=
ing to lower rates below 3.25% for fear of stoking inflation. Meanwhile, th=
e European Union government would like to censure Germany for irresponsible=
 spending which is pushing their debt levels close to the 3% of GDP limit s=
et out in the Maastrict treaty.   Further weighing on the euro was German C=
hancellor Schroeder's remark today that his government has not come up with=
 a list of spending cuts or tax hikes to reign in Germany's budget deficit.=
 German states do not want to reduce spending and this now compromises Fin =
Min Eichel's promise to the EU that the government would bring the budget c=
lose to balance by 2004, which was part of the compromise under which Germa=
ny avoided an embarrassing censure from the EU this month for its rising de=
ficit. This also suggests that there is no way Eichel's promise can be met =
and that they may indeed face a fine from the EU this year if their growth =
projections are too high and revenue therefore too low, which would push th=
e deficit to GDP ratio above the 3% limit.  EUR/USD fell to key support at =
87.10 and could threaten the 86.80 level which marks the 50% retracement of=
 the 85.63 to 88.03 move. Follow up support is seen at 86.50 and this month=
's 6 month low of 85.63. Failure to regain the key 87.40/50 mark will likel=
y keep pressure on the pair after it rebounded from last week's low of 86.8=
0 but met with heavy resistance at 87.46.  GBP/USD also fell to a day's low=
 of 1.4282 after rising to a day's high of 1.4330 but failing to break key =
resistance around1.4340/50. Sterling also failed to break resistance at the=
 60.80 pence level against the euro and subsequently fell to a day's low of=
 61.01. On Thursday, GBP/USD briefly rose to a new 3-week high of 1.4362 fo=
llowing surprisingly upbeat UK jobs data which raised the expectations of t=
he Bank of England raising rates later this year, which tend to benefit ste=
rling. However, 1.4340/50 marks the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.45=
15-1.4040 move and has so far provided tough resistance. Without a break of=
 that level, the pair remains heavy, dealers say. Support seen at previous =
resistance levels of 1.4235 and 1.4180.  USD/CHF rose to a day's high of 1.=
7004 from a low of 1.6968 after holding above support at 1.6960/50. Resista=
nce is now seen at 1.7055 which marks the 61.8% retracement of the 1.7229-1=
.6770 move. Support is seen at 1.6960, 1.6890 and 1.6820.  Meanwhile, the y=
en was little changed today, as the market remained cautious about the dire=
ction of USD/JPY after today's comments from Tokyo had little sway in the c=
urrency market. At Japan's news conference President Bush and PM Koizumi sp=
oke about the non-performing loan and deflation problems hurting the Japane=
se economy. But the only movement came after Bush said he and Koizumi had s=
poken about "devaluation," confusing it with deflation, and sending USD/JPY=
 spiking higher. JPY fell to a day's low of 132.85 against the dollar and 1=
16.00 against the euro following the remarks. But markets quickly adjusted =
for the gaff and currencies are expected to remain steady today with no key=
 data from the Eurozone and a Federal holiday in the US.  President Bush sa=
id he saw signs of a US economic recovery but maintained that Japan needed =
to stay vigilant about structural reforms. PM Koizumi repeated his pledge t=
o tackle deflation and prevent a financial crisis. He also defended his adm=
inistration's progress on reform, saying tough measures cannot be completed=
 in only one year.   However, the market was disappointed by Japan's shying=
 away on the injection of public funds into the troubled banking sector. Th=
e Nikkei rallied from 18-year lows this month following reassurances from t=
he government that they stood ready to give troubled banks money. But today=
 Japanese ministers again played down the need for any such action saying t=
hey saw no risk of a financial crises. Banking analysts were less certain, =
saying a bailout is inevitable given the precarious position of falling rev=
enues and rising problem loans.  In the meantime, USD/JPY will remain const=
rained by repatriation flows back to Japan ahead of the March 31 book closi=
ng. Afterwards, the yen is likely to come back under pressure as Japan begi=
ns to tackle deflation and prevent a financial crisis.  There is no key dat=

I just want to inform everybody that we are going to start trading with a new counter party called Seaport Group.  The employees of the counter party use to work for Amroc, which is an outfit we frequently traded with in the past.  The company is new but not the people at the organization.  If you have any question, please call.

o see the US ISM (NAPM) rise today to 50.6 in February from 49.9, putting i=
t back into expansion. Sentiment is mixed however and only a move through 8=

Support is seen at 86.30, 86.15, and 85.60. Resistance is viewed at 86.60, =
87.10, and 87.85.  Other data showed French consumer confidence took a step=
 backwards in February to minus 15 from minus 12, ending four consecutive m=
onths of gains. However, the EUR/USD stayed steady around a day's low of 86=
.67 after the news. Dealers do not see it as a sign of reversal in the impr=

Based on last night's mids...we show that ENA owes $21,541. Deals go out to 2004 and remaining tonnage is approx 22,500. Approx notional difference per ton of $26 seems to be a reasonable bid-offer spread (being that the fixed prices on the deals were $810 and $825).  Bob, do you agree with my assessment?  I cannot imagine 16 Bleached Folding Carton has much liquidity (what the hell is it???). Sara, you may want to forward the calcs to Bob...if we have any other 16 BFC deals (although I have a hard time believing we do) this may be a useful price point for other valuations. Sara, can we present a counterparty's calcs in lieu of standard quotes?

Notice to Members #02-73
March 14, 2002


To:	All NYMEX Division Members, Member Firms and Floor Clerks
	All NYMEX Division Clearing Members

From:	J. Robert Collins, President

Re:	REMINDER -- Timely Allocation of Trades



	Please be reminded that, pursuant to NYMEX Rule 9.04(M)(2), Clearing
Procedure, all trades executed on the NYMEX Division Trading Floor must be
allocated within one hour after the Exchange supplies the initial transfer
information.  A Floor Member is required to submit all transfer information,
including a customer account number, clearing member number and customer
type indicator code to the Clearing Member within this time period.  Timely
trade transfer information is extremely relevant for all Clearing Members
for the purpose of risk management.

Floor Members

	The Compliance Review Committee has been working with the Compliance
Depart-ment on a program for attaining compliance with this requirement.
Commencing on Monday, March 18, for the week ending March 15, 2002,
Compliance Staff will be issuing weekly advisory notices to Floor Members
who fail to allocate at least 75% of their transactions within one hour, as
required by Rule 9.04(M)(2).  We hope that this program, utilizing the
advisories, will alert Floor Members to allocation problems and effectively
achieve acceptable timely allocations prior to the formal implementation of
any other disciplinary action.

Clearing Members

	Floor Members have pointed out that trades cannot be allocated in a
timely fashion if incomplete information is relayed by the customer at the
time of order placement.  We are, therefore, requesting that Clearing
Members remind their customers that account information must be supplied to
the Floor Member promptly in order to ensure that trades are allocated in a
timely fashion.

* * * * * * * * * * *

	Any questions or problems should be brought to the attention of
either David Schneiderman, Director, Trade Practice, at 299-2857, or Russell
Cloughen, Associate Director, Trade Practice, at 299-2880.

It is apparent after several conversations last week that we need to come to some agreement on the termination criteria for the financial contracts.  Can we all meet at 11:00 am on the 5th floor in ECS.  I will come back to you all with a room number.

Sara - will you please bring the most recent copy of your list of all counterparties and expected terminations.

Thanks,

Sara - did Bears come back to you on selling the MLM shares we have left in the broker account?

We tried to call them before Christmas but they were going to call Alex Shears and then he was 
going to call you

thanks

Simon,
You can take the Metal Management issue.  

Why don't we fill out a wire request for the 66,307.44?  Bryan can sign and then fax to me for gary and my signature.  Lets try and see what happens. What do you think?

Simon,
I just faxed to you BS reports as of 12/28/01.  It appears total equity is 66,367.44 USD for Enron Credit.  The  metals position is still there.  

The quality of the reports is not good.

Please verify equity you think we should be able to withdraw.

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         Daniel:

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

         Regards.  Sara

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Kind regards

            Daniel:

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the
            remaining
            documents.

            Thanks.

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the
               regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Kind regards

               Daniel

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         "Agreement")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.

Thanks Cynthia.  I can put this one to rest for the time being (until we start looking for Mar02 delinquent payers).

Susan: Please note in the Demand Letter Log (DLL) that they are paid thru Feb02 invoice.

Sara: No demand letter on this CP, for now.  

Thanks all.

We sent a demand letter to this CP and they responded that NPC paid the invoice (Feb02 invoice# 0202437 for $1,473,836.00) on 2/15/02 via wire.  I have tried to call NPC a few times to get detailed wire information but to no avail.  Cynthia, is their claim of payment verifiable without more information?  If so, please verify and let me know.  Otherwise I'll keep trying to reach them.

Thanks

 Please mark your calendars for the swap group's "Attorney Roundtable" to meet on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month from 12 pm until 1pm  (or 1:30 pm) in Conference Room 3824.

Re:    Proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy Price Swap
Agreement between Enron North America Corp. ("Enron") and Morgan Stanley
Capital Group Inc. ("MSCGI")

Dear Susan:

Pursuant to the discussions between Anthony Lupiano of our Credit
Department and Bill Bradford of your Credit Department yesterday,
attached you will find a proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy
Price Swap Agreement.  The purpose of this Fourth Amendment is to amend
the Exposure Threshold definition.    It is my understanding that Mr.
Bradford has agreed to these terms.   Our Credit Department is expecting
that we bring this document to a closure quickly.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Kind regards,

t to raise their prices by $10  a bottle. This is a great last minute chanc=

 SALE  will be  $68.99 after Friday This is their standard bearer- their  f=
lagship wine that gets such high ratings each year. The 99 was one of two O=
regon wines on the "2001 Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines  of the World" list. =
This wine should do at least as well.   An excellent vintage from Ribbon Ri=
dge, the 2000 has a deep  saturated ruby/purple color. Ripe black cherry, c=
ola, and blackberry fruit dominate the bouquet. In the background a hint of=
 spicy  oak can be discerned. Still youthful, this medium to full-bodied wi=
ne has a layered palate, moderate tannin and a sweet, long  finish. It is a=
lways difficult to compare one vintage to another, but 2000 may represent a=
 hypothetical blend of 1998 and 1999. It  is not as powerful, muscular or t=
annic as the 1998 nor as forward, charming and accessible as the 1999. It i=
s a big wine and  certainly ranks with our finest vintages to date: 1993, 1=

with purple nuances. Shea tends to be a seductive, open-knit effort, even i=

 berry fruit intermixed with toasty wood emerge from the wine's aromas. Med=
ium to  full-bodied and fleshy, with more structure than previous vintages,=
 the 2000 offers the vineyard's hallmark black fruit and a  silky, lusty, h=

board voted unanimously to drop its pursuit of all other relocation
alternatives and to concentrate all its efforts on coming to a final lease
agreement with our exchange on becoming a tenant at One North End Avenue.
	According to the letter, the main issue that still must be addressed
is NYBOT's ability to obtain a firm commitment for sufficient government aid
to fund the installation of needed technology on the COMEX Division floor.
They believe that solidifying the aid, and drafting the formal lease, could
take one to three months. Their preliminary target for completion of the
necessary work and NYBOT's commencing trading on the COMEX Division floor is
the first quarter of 2003.
	The main terms are for NYBOT to use 13,000 to13,500 square feet of
the COMEX Division trading floor and to lease about 35,000 square feet of
office space in the building. The basic lease is for 10 years, with the
potential for one, and possibly two, five-year extensions.

We welcome this decision by the board of the New York Board of Trade and
applaud their commitment to preserving the role of Lower Manhattan as the
financial capital of the world.  We believe this move will be beneficial to
the members and member firms of both institutions from the standpoint of
creating both efficiencies and additional opportunities.

Sara,

I will be out of the office Tuesday through Friday, returning Monday the 11th.  If you need assistance from my group, please contact Ana Rizvi on 853-3552 or Melissa Rodriguez at 345-7679.  

I have requested the missing confirm from RBC, and have obtained the missing confirm from West LB.  We have put in the request to have the 2 Goldman confirms retrieved from archives, and hope to have them tomorrow.  I will review the J. Aron file and see if we have their confirmations.  I'll let you know what I find.

the fact that of 225 companies in the S?500 reporting Q3 earnings so far, 8=
5% matched or exceeded projected targets. Therefore, investors are looking =
ahead to an economic recovery next year and pushing up stocks now. Fears ab=
out the war on terrorism and concerns about the current economic environmen=
t have been discounted. Case in point: yesterday's surprise announcement of=
 two deceased postal workers who were exposed to anthrax failed to substant=
ially move the dollar lower. For that reason, the risk-aversion problem is =
fading for the dollar, and USD has now moved beyond September 11 attack lev=
els. In fact, after dealers put fears of war aside they began to reassess r=
elative growth rates amongst the majors and found the US economy to have be=
tter long-term prospects.  USD/JPY advanced above its offshore high of 122.=
60 to a fresh 9-week high of 122.84. Support is seen at 122.60 and the doll=
ar's upswing may intensify should it break 122.80, where stop-loss orders a=
re rumored to be placed. Major technical resistance is seen around 123.25. =
Weighing on the yen was today's economic data from Japan which showed consu=
mer confidence fell in September fell to 36.9, down four points from June a=
nd the weakest reading since 35.2 in September 1998.   Sterling also dipped=
 below yesterday's nine-week low of 1.4215, to a new low of 1.4208. Dealers=
 say comments made by Bank of England member Allsopp that he was concerned =
by the  four-year long overvaluation of sterling  pressured the pound. Alls=
opp, who is an external member, said a fall in sterling's value of as much =
as 10% would be welcome. He also felt UK interest rates should be cut furth=
er to tackle a combination of a weakening global economy and a slowdown in =
UK consumer demand. Minutes of the MPC's September and October meetings, re=
leased last week, showed that when the committee voted 7-2 on September 18 =
for a 25 basis point rate cut, Allsopp was one of two members to vote for a=
 half point cut.   Sterling is now hovering below the 50% Fibonacci retrace=
ment of this year's uptrend from around 1.37 to 1.48. If sterling's 6-cent =
slide in two weeks does not stabilize as investors take profit from the rec=
ent sell-off, cable will target 1.4120, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of =
this year's same uptrend from June. Boding well for the pound is the fact t=
hat the Bank of England appears ready to ease monetary policy again in orde=
r to bolster economic growth. The decline in September inflation below the =
2.5% target will provide the central bank with leeway to cut interest rates=
 again by another 25-bp this year and the BoE's willingness to spur growth =
(unlike the ECB) will benefit the pound.   EUR/USD came under further press=
ure on Monday following bearish economic forecasts from Germany's six leadi=
ng economic institution as well as uninspiring comments from ECB members ab=
out the plunge in growth. This stands in sharp contrast with market percept=
ion that aggressive fiscal and monetary policy will pay off for investors w=
ho bet on the US recovery. Some investors chose not to wait until Thursday'=
s ECB meeting because aside from reassurances that inflation would fall bel=
ow the targeted 2.0% level by next year, the ECB appears reluctant to give =
another 25 basis point cut this week. This will likely keep pressure on the=
 euro. However, even if the ECB were to lower rates, the market reaction co=
uld be muted because it has already been priced in for some time now. There=
fore, the euro again finds itself in a lose/lose situation because the ECB =
has failed to promote growth. A break of 88.70 sees EUR/USD targeting 88.25=
/50 area followed by 87.25, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of this year's =
uptrend from 83.45 to 93.35.  USD/CHF passed yesterday's 6-week high of 1.6=

has faded. USD/CHF is now above September 11 attack levels and even though =

		Local			- 3 Year Term
		Floor Broker		- 3 Year Term
		Trade (2)		- 3 Year Term/2 Year Term
		Equity Holder	- 3 Year Term
		At-Large		- 3 Year Term

A stockholder may not recommend more than one candidate per category.
Written recommendations by stockholders proposing candidates may be
presented prior to or at this meeting.  Thereafter, a list of the
recommendations of proposed nominees will be compiled and immediately
posted.

Additional written recommendations by stockholders for proposed nominees may
be submitted to the Subcommittee (c/o the Donna Talamo, Office of the
Corporate Secretary, One North End Avenue, Room 1563, New York, NY 10282 or
by fax 212-301-4645) by 5:00 p.m. on January 22, 2002.  Thereafter, a final
list of recommended names and the categories in which they are proposed to
run will be immediately posted.

NO PERSON WHOSE NAME HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED BY 5:00 P.M. ON TUESDAY, JANUARY
22, 2002 WILL BE PERMITTED TO STAND FOR ELECTION.  IN ADDITION, NO PERSON
WHOSE NAME HAS NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED TO RUN FOR VICE CHAIRMAN BY THAT DATE

Please note that in order to qualify as a Public Director, a person must be
knowledgeable of futures trading or financial regulation or otherwise
capable of contributing to the deliberations of the Board of Directors and
may not be a member of the Exchange or affiliated with any member of the
Exchange or an employee of the Exchange.

After January 22, 2002, the Subcommittee will convene to make its
determination as to the eligibility of the proposed nominees to run in the
category for which he was proposed or otherwise.   Such determination will
be immediately posted.  Should the Subcommittee determine that a proposed
candidate is ineligible to run in the category for which he was recommended,
written notice thereof shall immediately be submitted to that person.  To
assist the Subcommittee, NYMEX members may submit information regarding the
eligibility of a proposed nominee to the Subcommittee.  All such submissions
must be received by 5:00 p.m. on January 29, 2002 at the Office of the
Corporate Secretary.  In addition, a proposed nominee may appeal the
Subcommittee's categorization.  Such appeal must be made by 5:00 p.m. on
February 1, 2002.  The Subcommittee will consider the appeal and make a
final ruling no later than February 5, 2002.  At that time, the Subcommittee
will assign the proposed nominees to the proper categories, regardless of
the category for which the proposed nominee was originally recommended;
however, only persons who were recommended to be candidates for Vice
Chairman are eligible to run for that office.

TO BE OFFICIALLY NOMINATED, EACH PROPOSED NOMINEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO FILE
WITH THE OFFICE OF THE CORPORATE SECRETARY A DECLARATION WHICH STATES THAT
CATEGORY IN WHICH THE PERSON INTENDS TO STAND FOR ELECTION.  FAILURE TO
SUBMIT A DECLARATION TO THE OFFICE OF THE CORPORATE SECRETARY BY 5:00 P.M.
ON FRIDAY FEBRUARY 8, 2002 WILL RENDER THE PROPOSED NOMINEE INELIGIBLE TO

a tight range against the euro and sterling as both EUR/USD and GBP/USD sho=

rnight, the pair briefly tested resistance at 89.50, but was rejected. Now,=
 failure to maintain above 89.10/20 would probably call for a test lower to=
 87.60/40. Looking at the hourly chart, EUR/USD has traded neatly within th=

.96. These levels are 90.72 and 87.64 respectively and were tested on Decem=

 recovered.   EUR/GBP also fell to a day's low of 61.88. Support at 61.70 s=

the unemployment rate is on its way to hitting 5%. The US Philly Fed survey=

ng in October. The headline survey is expected to fall to -16.5 from -7.3, =
and the market will also look to its new orders component, which is seen as=
 a leading indicator.   The dollar steadied on Thursday after an extremely =
choppy US session overnight, which was provoked by a surge in anxiety follo=
wing news of more anthrax attacks against the US. Fed Chairman Greenspan tr=
ied to calm fears by saying that long-term prospects of the US economy rema=
ined bright, but US equity markets were more concerned about the uncertaint=
y of when the US would recover. The White House's Lindsey also said on Wedn=
esday the US will probably see "small negative" GDP in Q3, therefore making=
 it likely the US economy will have 2 quarters of negative GDP and official=
ly be in a state of recession. Nevertheless, dealers were quick to push the=
 euro and yen back down amid sentiment that the US would fare better than J=
apan and the Eurozone because of more fiscal and monetary stimulus in the U=
S.  Indeed that sentiment was reinforced by today's cut in the German growt=
h forecast. FinMin Eichel said Germany's economy was likely to grow by arou=
nd 0.75% this year and by 1.0-1.5% in 2002. Markets have long been weary ab=
out European nation growth forecasts and this week even the European Union =
warned against what it saw to be over inflated expectations. Therefore, the=
 market has been very reluctant to buy the euro, even amid the US war in Af=
ghanistan (with ground troops now) and increasing occurrences of bio-terror=
ism on US soil.   The short-term outlook for the euro was not helped by the=
 European Central Bank's bulletin which echoed statements from last Thursda=
y when it kept interest rates on hold. The ECB said that despite the fact t=
hat the September 11 attacks could delay a rebound in the euro zone's slugg=
ish economy, it felt that monetary policy was appropriate at the moment. De=
alers were less sure, and kept EUR/USD near day lows around 90 cents. EUR/U=
SD hit a session high of 90.40 but remains in its downward channel since pe=
aking at 93.38 on September 17, and was further weakened by its inability t=
o maintain gains above 90.85 last week, which led to a net reduction in lon=
g positions. Therefore, the technical outlook for the euro remains bearish =
as it targets last week's lows of 89.87. Near-term resistance is seen at 90=
.40 followed by 90.85. Meanwhile, USD/CHF also traded rangebound around the=
 key 1.6400 mark.  The biggest mover was sterling which broke lower out of =
its consolidation pattern. GBP/USD hit a session low of 1.4423 after testin=
g upside resistance at 1.4500. Cable continues to trade in a range from 1.4=
400 to 1.4550 since last Thursday. Resistance is now seen at 1.4450, the 61=
.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.4395-1.4540. If sterling canno=
t regain this level, cable is seen targeting 1.4400, the 38.2% Fibonacci re=
tracement of the move from 1.37 to last Monday's 8-1/2 month high of 1.4836=
.   Today's mixed retail sales data had little effect on the pound. Monthly=
 retail sales were lower than expected but the August figures were revised =
up. Retail sales growth is still very strong and this is a positive for ste=
rling because it shows a resilient consumer. And, since the BoE has left th=
e door open for more rate cuts, any fall in consumer confidence would likel=
y be met by further rate cuts, thus supporting sterling.  Meanwhile, USD/JP=
Y traded around the 121 figure. A minor setback in USD/JPY came following c=
omments by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who was reported as=
 saying it was harmful to think a weak yen would solve Japan's economic pro=
blems. But, the dollar continues to find support on hopes the U.S. economy =
will improve in the long term. Today, Finance Minister Shiokawa said he cou=
ld not assure that the Japanese economy would not contract. But this was no=
t a surprise to the markets considering Japan's GDP fell 0.8 percent in Apr=
il-June from the previous quarter, and many economists expect full-year con=
traction for the current fiscal year ending in March 2002. USD/JPY now hove=
ring above support at 120.85 after failing to break resistance around the 1=
22 level on Wednesday. For now, bull trend remains in doubt unless it can r=
egain the 121.00 level. If not, USD/JPY expected to trade in a range of 120=
 to 122.  European bourses are down around 2% this morning, following techs=
 lower after yesterday's slide in the Nasdaq. The tech sector is under heav=
y pressure and 4 key tech companies report today. Those are Sun, Ebay and G=
ateway. But Microsoft's announcement is not seen to be key because the rele=
ase of Windows XP later this month will put that revenue in next quarter's =
release. GM's earnings will be watched for a positive surprise considering =
their large gains in market share through 0% financing in the later part of=
 Q3. The dollar will likely trade around the earnings parade and given stro=

be affected by the direction of US stocks. Other key companies announcing t=

It is apparent after several conversations last week that we need to come to some agreement on the termination criteria for the financial contracts.  Can we all meet at 11:00 am on the 5th floor in ECS.  I will come back to you all with a room number.

Sara - will you please bring the most recent copy of your list of all counterparties and expected terminations.

Thanks,

Don

FROM:	J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

RE:		EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., announced today that it will change
the early closing time for coal futures to 12:30 P.M. for days that the
Exchange has designated for early closings.

These days include December 31, 2001, and January 18; February 15; May 24;
August 30; and December 24 and 31 in 2002.

The change reflects the abbreviated trading hours under which the Exchange
has been operating since September 17 and will remain in place until the
hours are extended. All other open outcry energy markets except propane
futures will continue to cease at 1:00 P.M. on those days. Propane futures
close at 12:15 P.M.  The early closing for aluminum and palladium will
remain at noon; silver and copper will end at 12:05 PM on those days; and
gold and platinum will close at 12:10 P.M. Electricity futures will close at
its regular time of 9 A.M.

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		EXCHANGE TO WAIVE LOX SURCHARGES
________________________________________________________

The executive committee of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today
announced that it would, until further notice, waive the surcharges
associated with large order execution (LOX) in natural gas futures.

Under the program, introduced on November 30, there was a $2.50 per contract
surcharge for receiving a response to a request for a quote on simultaneous
execution of a transaction of between 250 and 5,000 contracts, reduced to
$1.50 per contract if the trade was executed.

This move is being made to stimulate activity in this new instrument, which
we are confident will prove useful to both commercial sector participants
and major funds.

>>Here is a great story that one of my Veteran buddies sent me this 
>>morning..... thought I would pass this along... 
>>One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my 
>>class 
>>was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked like 
>>he was 
>>carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, "Why would anyone 
>>bring 
>>home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd." 
>> 
>>I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my 
>>friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went 
>>on. 
>> 
>>As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They 
>>ran at 
>>him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he 
>>landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land 
>>in the 
>>grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this 
>>terrible 
>>sadness in his eyes. 
>> 
>>My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and as he 
>>crawled 
>>around looking for his glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye. As I 
>>handed 
>> him his glasses, I said, "Those guys are jerks. They really 
>>should get 
>>lives." 
>>He looked at me and said, "Hey thanks!" There was a big smile on 
>>his 
>>face. 
>>It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. > 
>>I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As 
>>it 
>>turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen 
>>him 
>>before. He said he had gone to private school before now. 
>>I would have never hung out with a private school kid before. We 
>>talked 
>>all the way home, and I carried some of his books. He turned out 
>>to be a 
>>pretty cool kid. I asked him if he wanted to play a little 
>>football with 
>>my friends. He said yes. We hung out all weekend and the more I 
>>got to 
>>know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of 
>>him. 
>>Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of 
>>books 
>>again. 
>>I stopped him and said, "Boy, you are gonna really build some 
>>serious 
>>muscles with this pile of books everyday!" He just laughed and 
>>handed 
>>me half the books. 
>>Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we 
>>were 
>>seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on 
>>Georgetown, 
>>and I was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be friends, 
>>that 
>>the miles would never be a problem. He was going to be a doctor, 
>>and I 
>>was going for business on a football scholarship. Kyle was 
>>valedictorian of our class. 
>>I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a 
>>speech 
>>for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there 
>>and 
>>speak. Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He was one 
>>of 
>>those guys that really found himself during high school. He filled 
>>out 
>>and actually looked good in glasses. He had more dates than I had 
>>and 
>>all the girls loved him. Boy, sometimes I was jealous. 
>>Today was one of those days. I could see that he was nervous about 
>>his 
>>speech. So, I smacked him on the back and said, "Hey, big guy, 
>>you'll 
>>be great!" He looked at me with one of those looks (the really 
>>grateful 
>>one) and smiled. "Thanks," he said. 
>>As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began. 
>>"Graduation 
>>is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough 
>>years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a 
>>coach...but 
>>mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you that being a 
>>friend to 
>>someone is the best gift you can give them. I am going to tell 
>>you a 
>>story." 
>>I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of 
>>the 
>>first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. 
>> He 
>>talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't 
>>have to 
>>do it later and was carrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me 
>>and 
>>gave me a little smile. 
>>"Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from doing the 
>>unspeakable." I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this 
>>handsome, 
>>popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his Mom 
>>and dad 
>>looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that 
>>moment did I realize it's depth. 
>>Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one small 
>>gesture 
>>you can change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts 
>>us 
>>all in each other's lives to impact one another in some way.

Sara,

I talked with Brent Hendry late yesterday.  He would like to be e-mailed a form template called "Credit Review Sheet" because he is implementing something at his new job similar to what we have.  Who would I call to get such a form?

Thanks!
Becky

f 123.49 yen and a 3-1/2 week high of $1.4213 against the pound in European=

 the US. After falling to profit taking on Friday, following the largest dr=
op in US industrial production in 11 years to -1.1%, the dollar regained it=
s momentum as investors showed they still prefer the future outlook for USD=
 over other major currencies. The dollar index is now at highs last seen in=
 August, at 116.89, which put the euro under pressure at a day's low of $0.=
8789.   EUR/USD peaked around 88.60 on Friday, but was unable to hold onto =
gains above 88.40, which led the pair back towards the 88-cent level on Mon=
day. Last week, the euro flirted with 88 cents, but maintained above key re=
sistance around 87.45. The Bundesbank November monthly report indicated as =
expected that Q3 growth was flat for the Eurozone's number one economy. Fla=
t growth in Q2 also contributed to a year on year growth rate of around 0.2=
5%, down from 0.6% in Q2, thus showing that Germany is very close to a tech=
nical recession. EUR/USD edged back below 88 cents, but did not trigger sto=
p loss orders and held to a day's low of 87.89.  Traders anticipate Wednesd=
ay's release of Germany's Ifo business climate index (an estimate of German=
 growth, which accounts for about one-third of the Eurozone) to recover sli=
ghtly in November to 86 after plunging to 85 in October from 89.5. Markets =
also await Eurozone industrial production figures for September, which like=
ly dropped since French and Italian outputs declined. Disappointing results=
 will most likely spark renewed selling in the euro. Support is seen at the=
 88-cent figure, backed by 87.70 and 87.45. Resistance is seen at 89.0, 89.=
30 and 89.50.  USD/JPY rose to a new 3-1/2 week high of 123.49, following a=
nother grim assessment of the Japanese economy by the Bank of Japan in its =
November report. "Adjustments in economic activity are becoming severe, as =
the substantial decline in production is beginning to have an adverse effec=
t on private consumption through decreases in employment and income," the B=
oJ said in the monthly report. This was the sixth straight month the Bank c=
ited weakening private consumption and falling corporate profits at banks a=
nd the deterioration in the manufacturing sector will add weakness to domes=
tic demand, it said.   Following another downgrade in Japan's economic outl=
ook, it now appears that FY02 tax revenue will probably be revised down by =
Y2.8 trln from Y49.6 trln, according to the MoF. Therefore, sticking to PM =
Koizumi's important reform to limit JGB issuance to 30 trillion yen in FY02=
 will be difficult. In order to achieve this, further expenditure cuts will=
 be needed, which will likely find strong opposition within Koizumi's own L=
DP party. Japanese FinMin Shiokawa maintained that the government would lim=
it new issuance to Y30 trln, but more LDP lawmakers are now openly requesti=
ng further fiscal stimulus. Aggravating the situation is that tax projectio=
n for FY02 is most likely to be revised down further.  Adding pressure to t=
he yen is the fact that the BoJ decided by majority vote to keep monetary p=
olicy unchanged last week. It had eased in August and again in September bu=
t has since been keeping a wait-and-see stance. Interest rates are still ne=
ar zero and its liquidity supply in the money market exceeds its stated tar=
get of 6 trillion yen. Moreover, another possible move by the BoJ would be =
to purchase more foreign bonds, which would lead to a substantial fall in t=
he yen.   Rumor of selling interest in USD/JPY by exporters around 123.20 c=
apping gains. Technical resistance around 123.35 also limiting upside poten=
tial. Meanwhile, with little room for improvement in the Japanese economy u=
ntil late next year, most market watchers see the yen heading for 125 now t=
hat it has successfully breached the 123 mark. Resistance is seen around 12=
3.35/45. But USD/JPY support is expected to hold at 121.95/122.00 followed =
by 121.40/50, with any pullback towards the latter level seen as a buying o=
pportunity, dealers said.  EUR/GBP rose to a fresh high of 62.05 but is exp=
ected to stay rangebound at around 61-62 pence after recovering from recent=
 10-week lows around 60 pence. When that cross is steady, GBP/USD shadows t=
he movements in the more dominant EUR/USD. So far, cable has fallen to a ne=
w one-month low of 1.4210 as it continues to suffer further declines since =
last Wednesday's inflation report by the Bank of England signaled a shift i=
n market sentiment. The market is now more aware of the weaknesses the UK f=
aces due to the internal and external imbalances in the economy. BoE's King=
 pointed out that those imbalances might lead to a weaker pound. Moreover, =
the Bank appears more concerned about future inflationary pressures given t=
hat interest rates are now at a 40-year low. Therefore, interest rates are =
likely to be left on hold just as the labor market is showing its first sig=
ns of weakness, which will weigh on the pound. Major support now stands at =
1.4195 after GBP fell below key levels of 1.4250 and 1.4230.  Meanwhile, US=
D/CHF rose to a session high around 1.6673 after falling to a low of 1.6536=
 on Friday. Helping the dollar were comments from Swiss National Bank Chair=
man Jean-Pierre Roth who said the outlook for the U.S. economy is uncertain=
 but could improve if the war in Afghanistan ended. "The uncertainty is cur=
rently unusually great. But there is a certain chance now that the developm=
ents could come out better than feared. If and when it is true that the war=
 in Afghanistan is over, that could give some important psychological impet=
us," he said. "Switzerland is so dependent on world trade that of course we=
 cannot escape from developments abroad," he said. Moreover, the SNB aimed =
to conduct monetary policy "so that our interest rates are as low as possib=
le in order to provide relief for the economy, but so that at the same time=
, we do not endanger price stability," he added. Inflation in Switzerland i=
s below one percent.  On Friday, Roth said in an interview with the Financi=
al Times that the Swiss franc's role as a safe-haven currency is declining =
because of the emergence of the euro. Thus Roth felt more at ease that the =
Swiss franc is reverting to the status of a normal currency as it becomes "=
less important as a financial asset". The Swiss National Bank has been dism=
ayed by the appreciation in the Swiss franc as investors sought shelter ami=
dst recent political uncertainty, thereby prompting the central bank to cut=
 rates. Roth asserted that "if we were to face large capital inflows we wou=
ld have to respond through monetary policy and interest rates" because "it =
is an illusion to think that we have other instruments that we could use to=
 curb inflows". Upside capped at 1.6680 and 1.670. Support holds at 1.6535,=
 1.650 and 1.6480.  Today's US data is expected to show a decline in housin=
g starts as the slowdown in the general economy starts to outweigh the bene=
fits of record low mortgage rates. However, USD strength continues to stem =
from the belief that the US-backed war in Afghanistan is going better than =
anticipated and this is translating into a fall in uncertainty and a rise i=
n confidence. Accordingly, dealers anticipate further gains on Wall Street =
this week, which is adding to the dollar's buoyancy.   =09[IMAGE] Audio Mkt=

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

It seems that tomorrow, Friday, does not work for everyone, but Monday at

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

I will investigate getting an accounting entity set up for ECTMI - does anyone know the number?

in the meantime (and don't shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEF
broker account to have a new name - see company below

We must move Anker as a matter of urgency.  Let's discuss.

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 3 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 10, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $2,500)
=			$2,500
One Short Tier 3 NG or NN	(1 * $2,000)
=		- 	$2,000
Net Scan Risk		($2,500-$2,000)
=			$   500
Spread Rate		(1* $500)
=		+	$   500
Total Requirement
=			$1,000

What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested could
be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

      Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
      amending
      the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

      Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
   the
      language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

      I trust this will now close the open issues.

      I look forward to hearing from you

      Kind regards

      Daniel:

      Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
      relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
      If
      you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
   and
      we
      can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber
   of
      Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
      brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
      are
      not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
      other
      business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
      limitation
      of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

      "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or
   from
      any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
   special,
      punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

      Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of
   the
      office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

      All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
      executed
      together with the terms of business letter.

      Regards.  Sara

         Sara

         The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
      relationship
         with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
      relate
         to
         the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with
   the
      PB
         relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

         Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
         addressed
         in the documentation as drafted.

         I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
   possible
      so
         we
         can try to get this wrapped up today.

         Kind regards

         Daniel:

         Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
         conflict
         because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
   Par.8
         requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
      Terms
         of
         Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
   prevail.
         Are
         you agreeing with this analysis?

         Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
   conflict
         with
         the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the
   PB
         (except
         for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
      Enron
         Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
   the
         Terms
         of Business in the same manner.

         Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
      suggest a
         different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
         remaining
         documents.

         Thanks.

            Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
   Arbitration -
         more
            appropriate to general terms of business which principally
         contemplate
            the
            regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
   event
      of
            inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
   A3).

            I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

            Kind regards

            Daniel:

            Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
      "Agreement")
            with my colleague Angela Davis.

            I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
         relating
            to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
   discussed
      but
            were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

            (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par.
   14
      of
            the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible
   use
      of
            arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in
   the
         OSLA)
            so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
      the
            Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
   English
         courts,
            I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which
   will
            prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

            (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
      manner
         as
            Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
   that
      you
            and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
      shouldn't
            these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

            I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of
   the
            account documentation.  Regards.

Hi Sara
How are you doing? I am so sorry to hear about all the stress happening over there. I am thinking about and hope you can take a vacation soon! Things here are fine. Just getting ready for the holidays. I was hoping to talk to you about gifts for my dad. I am not sure what to get him. I got him a subscription to Sports Illustrated and was thinking about getting him  DVD player. What are your suggestions?
Anythign would be a huge help! And I am excited to see you in New Orleans too. I am there for a week and hoping to spend some time with you all. Have a good day.
Oh and Park's friend is Nick Barnard and he is in the financial dept.

Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language amending
the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

I trust this will now close the open issues.

I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards

Daniel

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.  If
you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and we
can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore, are
not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have other
business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation
of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed
together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

   The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your relationship
   with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that relate
   to
   the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the PB
   relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

   Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
   addressed
   in the documentation as drafted.

   I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible so
   we
   can try to get this wrapped up today.

   Kind regards

   Daniel:

   Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
   conflict
   because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
   requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the Terms
   of
   Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
   Are
   you agreeing with this analysis?

   Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
   with
   the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
   (except
   for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is Enron
   Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
   Terms
   of Business in the same manner.

   Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or suggest a
   different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
   remaining
   documents.

   Thanks.

      Daniel:

      Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the "Agreement")
      with my colleague Angela Davis.

      I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
   relating
      to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but
      were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

      (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14 of
      the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of
      arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
   OSLA)
      so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the
      Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
   courts,
      I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
      prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

      (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same manner
   as
      Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that you
      and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why shouldn't
      these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

      I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
      account documentation.  Regards.

?UNRESOLVED MANAGEMENT ISSUES

  Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues when it comes to choosing legal research resources?

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription to our Solo Edition. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

Notice No. 02-32
January 28, 2002

TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day

Please be reminded that Thursday, January 31, 2002, is the First Notice Day,
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of February
2002 (the new spot month).

On Wednesday, January 30, 2002, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers
and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry
("OLTE") system trained representative available until such time as the
Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

 from last week's dizzying 5.5-centime gain. USD gave way to heavy profit-t=
aking as dealers also anticipated a possible decline in US equities on Tues=
day following impressive gains overnight. Choppy trade ahead of a shortened=
 Thanksgiving holiday week should add to volatility, but USD is not expecte=
d to lose its bullish trend any time soon. Ahead of the holiday, traders wi=
ll look to today's trade data from the US as well as tomorrow's key Ifo sur=
vey from Germany.  Dealers will watch today's US trade data which is expect=
ed to show a narrowing of the deficit to $15 billion from $27.1 billion in =
August. Due to the accounting treatment of foreign insurance payments relat=
ed to the WTC attacks, the deficit could shrink to around $14-15 billion co=
mpared to the $24-25 billion that is expected. The $11 billion in insurance=
 payments would have a positive impact on nominal GDP for Q3 GDP due on Nov=
ember 30 and would give a psychological boost to the market. However, this =
is completely offset in the deflator and does not affect real GDP, which is=
 still expected to fall around 0.9% in Q3. Therefore, since the adjustment =
for reinsurance claims in nominal GDP is fully offset by the GDP deflator, =
only the decline in exports which does not count the $11 billion in insuran=
ce claims will be counted towards real GDP. Trade flows were disrupted foll=
owing the 9/11 attacks and reduced both imports and exports, but according =
to the commerce department, every $1 billion decrease in the September defi=
cit is worth between 0.1 and 0.2 points on the real GDP growth rate.  Meanw=
hile, the leading indicators index appears to have risen in October by a sl=
ight 0.1% after falling 0.5% in September. However, this figure could be di=
storted upwards due to an irregularity in delivery times.   EUR/USD rose to=
 a session high of 88.38 in European trade, but after its inability to hold=
 onto gains above 88.40 last week, the pair is expected to edge back toward=
s the 88-cent level. On Monday, the euro reached a 3-month low of 87.67 but=
 maintained above key resistance around 87.45. Weighing on the single curre=
ncy was the Bundesbank's November monthly report which indicated as expecte=
d that Q3 growth was flat to negative for the Eurozone's number one economy=
. No growth in Q2 (-0.003%) also contributed to a year on year growth rate =
of around 0.25%, down from 0.6% reported in Q2, thus showing that German gr=
owth rapidly deteriorated towards a technical recession.   GBP/USD rose to =
a session high of 1.4190 after trade data came in largely as expected with =
a September trade deficit of 2.25 billion pounds. Expectations were for a f=
all to 2.1 billion after August's 3.3 billion deficit. The fall in the Sept=
ember trade deficit was helped by a larger than expected surplus with the U=
S. The figure alleviated some concern in the market since last week's comme=
nt by Bank of England member King who pointed out that the current account =
imbalances might lead to a weaker pound.   Nevertheless, cable continues to=
 suffer from this comment as well as last Wednesday's inflation report by t=
he Bank of England, which signaled a shift in market sentiment towards the =
pound. The market is now more aware of the weaknesses the UK faces due to t=
he internal and external imbalances in the economy. Moreover, the market fe=
ars the Bank is more concerned about future inflationary pressures given th=
at interest rates are now at a 40-year low. Therefore, with interest rates =
likely to be left on hold just as the labor market is showing its first sig=
ns of weakness, the pound has slipped from last week's high around 1.46 to =
yesterday's 3-1/2 month lows around 1.41. Dealers say cable's break of supp=
ort at 1.4195 is bearish, and is now targeting the 1.4000 level. Resistance=
 now stands at 1.4195 followed by 1.4220.  Meanwhile, USD/JPY edged back to=
 key support around 122.75 after reaching a fresh 3-month high of 123.45 on=
 Monday. This correction was expected after recent gains, but any selling b=
ack towards 122.50 or 122.00 sould not be enough to offset the overall bull=
ish trend. Sentiment continues to underpin USD because of the renewed momen=
tum in US equities as investors show an increasing appetite for risk. The y=
en also came under additional pressure from mounting worries about the Japa=
nese banking sector ahead of a slew of earnings reports by major Japanese b=
anks later this week. However, it is worth noting that Japanese banking pro=
blems can sometimes lead to yen appreciation if those institutions are havi=
ng to repatriate foreign funds to cover losses. But, with little room for i=
mprovement in the Japanese economy until late next year, most market watche=
rs see the yen heading for 125 now that it has successfully breached the 12=
3 mark. Resistance is seen around 123.35/45. But USD/JPY support is expecte=
d to hold at 121.40/50, with any pullback towards the latter level seen as =

night low of 1.4340, but remained within a channel from 1.4340 to 1.4480. A=
gainst the euro, sterling rose to a high of 61.73 pence, but resistance at =
61.70 held, which should keep sterling's gains in check. However, follow-up=
 buying in GBP was subdued as markets generally expected no rate cut from t=
he BoE.  The euro also rose to a day's high around 89.35 cents ahead of key=
 Eurozone data today, but fell following a surprise drop in German data. No=
vember industrial output fell 1.8% m/m after strong declines in the previou=
s months to bring the y/y down 4.8%. The decline beat the consensus forecas=
t for a fall of 0.2% and was very negative, but possibly not surprising giv=
en the amount of attention paid to Germany's manufacturing woes. Neverthele=
ss, the fall is likely to put Q4 GDP at or near 0% and will put the ECB in =
a bind to cut interest rates in February.   EUR/USD price action continued =
to move within a channel from 88.70 to 89.50 as it hovers around the key 89=
.10 level, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25=
 to 95.96. Overnight, the pair briefly tested resistance at 89.50, but was =
rejected. Now, failure to maintain above 89.10/20 would probably call for a=
 test lower to 88.70 followed by 87.60, which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci ret=
racement level of the same move. Moves higher are not seen by the market as=
 indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents. =
 Meanwhile, the yen pared earlier gains despite concerns voiced by Japanese=
 officials today that the yen's slide was too fast. Dealers were quick to b=
uy USD/JPY near the 132.00 level after its recent fall from a new 3-year hi=
gh of 133.37. PM Koizumi said at visit to Malaysia that Japan was not lower=
ing the yen intentionally and that FX rates should be decided by markets.  =
However, Malaysian PM Mahathir said he was watching with interest the impac=
t of a yen fall on the Chinese yuan and ASEAN currencies.   Concern over th=
e yen's 10% decline over the past 2 months corresponds with PM Koizumi's 7-=
day tour around Southeast Asia, which began on Wednesday. Although US monet=
ary officials have expressed a desire to let markets determine FX rates, co=
untries such as China and Korea have voiced concern about Japan exporting t=
heir deflation to the rest of the area. Overnight remarks by an official fr=
om South Korea's Finance and Economic Ministry that the weakening in the ye=
n could create malaise in other Asian markets, hints that for political rea=
sons Japanese officials are now likely to remain quiet until the PM returns=
.  Therefore, in the absence of further encouragement by Japanese monetary =
officials for a weaker yen, a period of consolidation would not be unusual.=
 But any correction in USD/JPY would likely hold around 130-132 dealers say=
. EUR/JPY rose to a day's high of 118.76 but needs to hold above yesterday'=
s low of 117.50 or it may target last week's lows around 116.90 and the 2-w=
eek low of 116.50. Upside is seen capped at 118.75 and last week's 2-year h=
igh of 119.71.  Despite the yen's reprieve from further losses, market sent=
iment remains very bearish. A recent report from the American Enterprise In=
stitute for Public Policy Research says that JPY will come under further pr=
essure in March once the market realizes that Japan is on the road to defau=
lt if it does not reflate the economy. The Economic Outlook report contends=
 that the government is expected to incur an unsustainable debt burden of $=
1 trillion in protecting depositors from the collapsing banking system in M=
arch when deposit insurance is revoked and Japanese investors likely make a=
 run on the bank, thereby bringing collapse.  Ex-Japanese Minister of Finan=
ce Sakakibara, aka Mr. Yen, also said he sees the yen possibly falling to 1=
50-160 per dollar towards year end. However, Sakakibara warned of possible =
intervention if the dollar rises above the psychological level of 140 yen. =
Mr. Yen said that yen weakness would permeate through to other Asian curren=
cies which should gradually weaken vs dollar along with yen. In reference t=
o Bank of Japan policy, he said the bank should keep easy monetary policy i=
ncluding more JGB purchases, but warned that excessive government spending =
would be ineffective and could lead to a collapse in the JGB market.  USD/C=
HF surged to 1.6619 after testing a session low of 1.6527 in early European=
 trade. Trendline support at 1.6500 followed by 1.6410 should hold for furt=

. The SNB is trying to talk the franc lower as a cheaper franc would boost =
export prospects and ease the economic pains facing the country. However, t=

PHOTOGRAPHING THE SEASONS - provided by the New York Institute of
Photography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are some ideas to help you take pictures that capture the essence of
the current season - winter, spring, summer, or fall. Even if you're in a
different latitude and your climate is considerably different from ours in
New York, you may still find valuable tips here. Our discussion of a
particular picture that we think captures the essence of the current
season in the Northern Hemisphere often involves a photographic technique
that is basic to good photography in general. So, whether you live in
Australia or Oahu, Beijing or Boston, check out this page for ideas you
may be able to use now or later.

RE:		EXCHANGE TO EXTEND NATURAL GAS TRADING HOURS TOMORROW

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will extend trading in its natural
gas futures and options contracts to 2:45 PM from their regular closing time
of 2:30 PM. in response to a change in schedule, due to the holidays, of the
release by the American Gas Association (AGA) of results of its weekly
storage survey report.

The rescheduling of the announcement coincides with the expiration of the
January natural gas futures contract.  The Exchange had previously announced
that trading in natural gas futures and options will be extended until 2:45
whenever the expiration of natural gas futures occurs on a Wednesday, the
regular release date of the AGA report.

I thought you've been saying Financial are largely 2-way but a few are 1-way and we would need to check for those.  Now "financial contracts are 1-way."  I'm confused.

Subject:	CP Contract Information

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

I received an inter-department delivery for you.  I am placing it in the mail to go to you.  The location on this inter-department envelope says EB3880.  Is that correct?

 growth was above expectations, the Bank of England may choose to lower rat=

 Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi asked his economic ministers to formulate =
anti-deflation measures prior to President Bush's visit to Japan this weeke=
nd. Also lifting the Japanese currency was the rebound in the Nikkei index =
back above the key 10,000-level. Additionally, the yen was supported by a s=
tronger-than-expected current account surplus that surged 42% from the prev=
ious year to 971.8 bln yen in December, arising more from an increase in th=
e income surplus that outpaced its trade surplus. The Financial Services Ag=
ency under direction of PM Koizumi will push banks to sell of their bad loa=
ns debt to the Resolution and Collection Corp. as a part of 6-point plan to=
 stabilize the financial system. Koizumi's plan to stabilize financial syst=

 a sweeping disposal of non-performing loans and to stabilize the stock mar=

133.70.  EUR/USD rose to  87.40, boosted by Bank of France Governor Trichet=
's comments that the euro is currently undervalued. He reiterated that a st=

ales to -3.4% in December from the previous month's 1.6%, or to -4.1% y/y f=
rom the previous -0.4%. Separately, the European Central Bank noted nothing=
 new about its inflation or growth outlook, but repeated that interest rate=

The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on  testing for dangerous chemicals outside the building, as a result of the tragic  events that have occurred in the past six weeks.  Ambient Group, Inc. has secured a  high-volume air sampling monitor (one of only four available to commercial  buildings in New York City) that tests for Benzene, Dioxin, P.C.B.s, as well a  large variety of other air borne chemicals and is based on EPA guidelines.  The Exchange has been testing for these  chemicals for the past few weeks and the first results will be available by next  week.  
 
Going forward, all test results will be posted and made  available to all building occupants on a weekly  basis.
 
Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to  contact Elliot Zuckerman, property manager, at (212)  299-2242.

It appears that the only position under this CP's GTC expired in Mar02.  Therefore the only issue on TRC is the A/R of $275,466 (consisting of Jan02 invoice amount $132,370 and Mar02 invoice amount $143,096).  In our list we show this CP with a status of "expired."  No need to send termination letter.

Susan: please update the Demand Letter Log - 
	Termination Letter column: Expired
	Comment column: $275,466 A/R outstanding.  On 3/12/02 Charles Comfort of TRC said TRC will pay the Jan02 invoice this month and will pay the Mar02 invoice in April.

Notice No. 02-62
February 25, 2002

TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Thursday, February 28, 2002, is the First Notice
Day, for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of
March 2002 (the new spot month).

On Wednesday, February 27, 2002, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all
Brokers and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade
Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until such time as
the Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

Notice No.:  01-445
December 27, 2001


NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS A MODIFIED
PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM


At its meeting on December 27, 2001, the NYMEX Board of Directors determined
to extend, with certain modifications, the current Proprietary Fee Reduction
Program ("Program") through December 2002.

Effective trade date January 2, 2002, Member Firms and individual members
who own seats will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 6 cents per
round turn (3 cents per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 1.25 cents per
round turn (.625 cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members' accounts should NOT adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments directly
to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention
to NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the
alpha code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact M. Dawn
Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.

		ALL MEMBER FIRMS
		ALL CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

RE:		POSITION ADJUSTMENT DEADLINES FOR THE MARCH 2002  METAL AND
ENERGY CONTRACTS [NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND
		COMEX RULE 4.37(A)]

	As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX
Division metals contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day
prior to the first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the
delivery month.  Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures
positions for the March 2002 metals contracts must be completed prior to
February 14, 2002.

	Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions
for NYMEX Division energy contracts are not permitted during the last three
trading days of the respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are
attached.

	If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact
Nick Galati at (212) 299-2920, Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919, or Bonnie
Yurga at (212) 299-2879.

NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may
not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other
bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor
transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a
clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the
concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that
the offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing
member filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request
that the delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the
filing of its clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that
a clearing member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also
files with the clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest
Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract,
including the termination date. The current delivery month in platinum and
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first
business day of the delivery month.

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may
not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other
bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor
transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a
clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the
concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that
the open positions are filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth
(10th) business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.
The current delivery month for Eurotop futures commences on the open of
trading on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the termination of the
respective futures contract, including the termination date.

Hi Sara,
I wanted to run this by you, since all of our templates are now under your review.  This is new language that I need to add to our templates -possibly after the "rounding language" section.  Once you approve this, I will make that change.  Please call me if you have any questions.
Thank you,
Kimberly Hundl x31647

Brent Hendry just informed me that the following language should added to all financial templates.

Corrections to Published Prices.  For purposes of determining the relevant prices for any day, if the price published or announced on a given day and used or to be used to determine a relevant price is subsequently corrected and the correction is published or announced by the person responsible for that publication or announcement, either Party may notify the other Party of (i) that correction and (ii) the amount (if any) that is payable as a result of that correction.  If a Party gives notice that an amount is so payable, the Party that originally either received or retained such amount will, not later than three (3) Business Days after the effectiveness of that notice, pay, subject to any applicable conditions precedent, to the other Party that amount, together with interest at the Interest Rate for the period from and including the day on which payment originally was (or was not) made to but excluding the day of payment of the refund or payment resulting from that correction.

We can talk about this.

Thanks,
Melissa

round 89.40 against the broadly stronger dollar. However, major currencies =
traded in tight ranges ahead of the key European Central Bank meeting at 7:=
45 AM. Whether or not they do cut rates today is uncertain and the ECB is w=
ell know for wrong-footing the market.  The euro showed little reaction to =
today's data from the Eurozone as most dealers took to the sidelines ahead =
of today's ECB meeting. EUR/USD was unchanged after Italian consumer confid=
ence rose in October because the raw data also pointed to a worsening in se=
ntiment following the U.S.-led attacks on Afghanistan. ISAE said in its mon=
thly report that the adjusted index rose to 124.3 this month from 121.2 in =
September, with confidence particularly strong on prospects for saving. How=
ever, ISAE said in a statement that "unfavourable expectations are emerging=
 on the general economic situation, on unemployment and on intentions to pu=
rchase durables". In the week following the start of the U.S. retaliatory s=
trikes against Afghanistan, which began on October 7, the unadjusted index =
fell to 118.3. "That contraction seems to mirror even greater pessimism tha=
n that registered immediately after the World Trade Centre attack," ISAE sa=
id.   Meanwhile, benign German inflation data and dismal business confidenc=
e surveys in Italy and Germany raised hopes of a rate cut this week, but un=
certainty still prevails. Preliminary data from Germany showed the national=
 inflation rate drawing near to the ECB's 2.0% target. This confirms the do=
wntrend, but it was also expected and may not be enough for the ECB to lowe=
r rates since Eurozone inflation for September stood at 2.4%.  The central =
bank last lowered its benchmark minimum bid rate by 50 basis points to 3.75=
 percent on September 17, its third easing of monetary policy this year. Th=
e rate cut was an effort to restore confidence following the September 11 a=
ttacks. A poll conducted by Reuters this week showed that out of 50 economi=
sts questioned, 27 now favor a rate cut. Last week, 21 of the same 50 backe=
d a cut. The number expecting no change has also dropped to 18 from 27 last=
 week, putting the chance of a rate cut at 52 percent, up from 48 percent l=
ast week.   The euro would likely rally from current levels around 89 cents=
 if the ECB were to cut by 25 basis points. But because a 25 bp cut has alr=
eady been priced into the market, the prospect for a sustained euro rally i=
s not great. However, a more surprising 50 bp cut would trigger a substanti=
al rise in the euro, possibly above the 90-cent figure. But given the curre=
nt optimism surrounding the US economy, any gains are likely to be limited =
unless today's US data disappoints markets. Euro remains in position to tes=
t against support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of 88.40. Current resist=
ance holds at 89.40 if the ECB does not cut rates.  Following this mornings=
 rate announcement by the ECB will be key US economic data which will give =
a markets a feel for the effect of the September 11 attacks on durable good=
s orders as well as this week's jobless claims figures. Durable goods order=
s are expected to show a sharp 1.4% decline in September from last month, b=
ringing the yearly rate down to around  16% after stabilizing in July and A=
ugust. Further declines are expected in the coming months as consumer and b=
usiness investment remains poor. Meanwhile, jobless claims are expected to =
hover around 480 k for the October 20 work week. Home sales are expected to=
 ease back in September after soaring in August and the effects from te att=
acks are not likely to be felt until later, housing analysts say.   GBP/USD=
 further retrenched in European trade, falling to a session low of 1.4249 f=
rom overnight highs around 1.4300. Losses in EUR/USD as well as weakness ag=
ainst the euro weighed on the pound. On Wednesday, Sterling seesawed on a c=
ombination of weak economic data followed by supportive comments by UK Mini=
ster Peter Hain who said it would be wrong to join the euro at the present =
time because the UK was better positioned to endure an economic slowdown th=
an Europe. Despite the remark, markets saw little reassurance in the earlie=
r data, which showed business confidence among UK manufacturers plummeted t=
o its lowest in three years in October. This prompted the CBI to call for a=
 50 bp cut from the Bank of England, the first time in three years the CBI =
has called for such a large rate cut. GBP/USD is now hovering near support =
at 1.4255 but the bearish trend is still intact after failing to regain the=
 1.43 level.  Dealers will also look to earnings reports for Q3. So far, ov=

st the European majors over the past few trading sessions is based on the b=
elief that this week's US data will show continued improvement. Moreover, P=
resident Bush's speech is expected to reflect a bullish outlook on the US e=
conomy. This has kept the dollar index hovering near the 120 level today, j=
ust shy of its 15-year highs around 121.00.  EUR/USD fell to a day's low of=
 85.93 in European trade following a failed attempt to break key resistance=
 at 86.35. The single currency now looks vulnerable to fall back below 86.0=
0 on its way to yesterday's 6-month low of 85.72. A break below this would =
then target 85.55, the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 t=
o 95.95. However, choppy trade over the next few days is likely and the mar=
ket does not see temporary moves higher as indicating strength. Resistance =
is viewed at 86.35, 86.50, and the key 87.40/50 level which marks the 61.8%=
 Fibonacci retracement of the same move.  In a newspaper interview publishe=
d Tuesday, the ECB's Issing said most studies indicate that the euro is und=
ervalued. However, Issing conceded that the central bank may have underesti=
mated the impact of the US slowdown on the Eurozone economy. In the near te=
rm, Q1-Q2 2002 growth is likely to be flat growth and that the euro FX rate=
 will be dependent on progress with EU reforms, which have been slow to mak=
e much headway, Issing said.  But holding back the dollar for the moment is=
 the fact that much hope has again been pinned on hopes of a speedy US reco=
very. Therefore, not only will this week's economic data have to impress, b=
ut all eyes will be on the Fed's FOMC meeting which convenes on Wednesday. =
A strong majority expects the Fed to stay put on rates. But the focus will =
be on their outlook for the economy and whether they change the easing bias=
 to neutral after an incredible 11 interest rate cuts last year to a 40-yea=
r low of 1.75%.   Another point of contention this week will be whether the=
 G7 meeting in Toronto and the World Economic Forum in New York become a so=
unding board for big global interests to bash the recent resurgence in the =
dollar. Manufacturers are likely to complain that the state of the economy =
is now about at the same level just prior to the September 11 attacks, but =
the USD index is again trading near 15-year highs.  In fact, recent dollar =
strength gave way to corrective yen buying on Monday as USD/JPY fell 1.5% f=
rom its recent 40-month highs around 134.90. The euro and pound crosses far=
ed worse and have fallen 3.75% and 2.5% respectively, since peaking at 2-ye=
ar highs last Thursday.   BoJ Governor Hayami helped push the yen higher fo=

carrying that much weight because it is widely known that the MoF conducts =
FX policy, not the BoJ.  Nevertheless, given the rapid fall in JPY over the=
 past 2 months and the subsequent consolidation, some dealers warn of furth=
er corrective buying in the yen before a renewed fall will push JPY below r=

Notice No. 01-350
October 22, 2001



TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and 			Clearing Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the November 2001 options contract for Copper (HX
X1) is Friday, October 26, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on shortened
trading hours as described in Notice to Members # 01-333
(http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_333.htm)

Trading in the November 2001 Copper Options Contract will cease at 1:00 P.M.
on October 26, 2001.  All Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing
Members of their intentions to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.


On Friday, October 26, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning October 29, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

Peter,

The details of the promissory note ("Loan Note 2002") from Greenfield to ECTRI in payment of agreed interest rate swap breakage costs in connection with the November 2001 Greenfield equity sale/LAKSHMI vessel financing workout transaction are as follows:

Maker: 			Greenfield Shipping Company Limited
Holder:			Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
Guarantor: 		Mitsui OSK Lines, Ltd.
Date of Note: 		November 20, 2001
Principal Amount:	US$12,720,000.00
Interest Rate: 		5% per annum (based on 360 day year)
ECTRI Swap Deal No.:	M148198

Repayment Schedule*:
	1st Payment:	January 31, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	2nd Payment:	February 28, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	3rd Payment:	March 29, 2002 -- US$561,621.52 (includes principal and interest)
	Final Payment:	April 30, 2002 -- remaining balance of principal plus accrued interest.

	* Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, the Loan Note is repayable in full upon refinancing of the vessel by Greenfield. 

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I'm copying Enron lawyers Alan Aronowitz and Sara Shackleton on this note so that they are also aware of the details of this ECTRI receivable and the fact that MOL appear to be arranging payment on behalf of Greenfield to ECTRI (at least for the January and February 2002 instalment obligations).

Kind regards,
Dan Rogers

Hi, Sara.

Brent said that you told him you gave me a copy of the Credit Review Sheet (or Credit Worksheet).  I haven't seen one from you.  Did you give it to someone else to forward to him?

Signed,

Sara,

I talked with Brent Hendry late yesterday.  He would like to be e-mailed a form template called "Credit Review Sheet" because he is implementing something at his new job similar to what we have.  Who would I call to get such a form?

Thanks!

> CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
> close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further

> transactions which have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and
> trade information submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this

>
> 2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
> expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
> day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
> Prior to 2:30 PM.
>
> Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report

> B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
> including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
> COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
> Clearing Department.
>
> C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
> Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.
>
> D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments

> options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or

>
> E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be

2002




Dear NYMEX Member:

On the Proxy Statement and ballot you received for the upcoming Annual
Meeting on March 19, 2002, a proposal has been put forth by the Board of
Directors to amend bylaw section 401 of the NYMEX Exchange relating to the
composition of the Executive Committee.  Currently, that bylaw requires the
Executive Committee to be composed of five members.  Under the proposed
bylaw amendment, the Board of Directors would be given the flexibility to
set the number of members of the Committee.  As is the case today, the
Chairman, Vice Chairman and Treasurer would sit on the Committee.

In the past year, the Exchange has faced a number of challenges, from the
tragic events of September 11 to the growth of competitive platforms.  I am
proud to say that the Board of Directors has risen to the occasion and taken
on these challenges head on with a high sense of involvement with and
commitment to this institution. By giving the Board the ability to set the
size of the Executive Committee, the Board will have the opportunity to
tailor the Executive Committee size to a number which it believes will be
effective in rapidly responding to circumstances at that time.

Depending on the individual Board, this flexibility will enable the Exchange
to capitalize on the level of involvement and specific skills of individual
Board members by engaging the appropriate number of members in the
decision-making process and by ensuring that all segments of the community
are represented.

In addition, from a corporate perspective, the proposed amendment makes
sense.  At the holding company level, the Board of Directors now has the
authority to set the number of members of the Executive Committee.  Approval
of the proposed bylaw amendment would make the Board's authority consistent
at both the holding company and exchange levels and would eliminate the
potential for discrepancies between the parent company and the Exchange.

I strongly urge that you vote in favor of the proposal.  As Chairman of the
Board, I have learned much about the workings of this institution in the
last year and believe that this proposal would enable this organization be
more efficient and effective.  I appreciate your consideration of the
proposal and look forward to working to address your needs in the coming
year.

							Sincerely,

				Vincent Viola
Chairman

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

I just faxed to you BS reports as of 12/28/01.  It appears total equity is 66,367.44 USD for Enron Credit.  The  metals position is still there.  

The quality of the reports is not good.

Please verify equity you think we should be able to withdraw.

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the "Confidentiality" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") or Enron Canada Corp. ("ECC").   I was asked to determine if the "Confidentiality" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) "the existence of a Master Agreement" or (b) "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the "Confidentiality" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose "the existence of a Master Agreement" or "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of "Confidentiality" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the "Confidentiality" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

The Exchange has received approval from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission to amend Supplement No. 1 "Official List of Approved Brands and

add White Pine Copper Refinery, Inc.'s copper brand "White Pine Copper" as
acceptable for delivery against the COMEX Grade 1 Copper Futures Contract

change reflects the acquisition of BHP Copper Inc.'s White Pine, Michigan

Subject: '99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies


Dear Ms. Sara Shackleton,

'99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies

We have our (extremely tiny) allocation of 1999 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti.
Prices are high (but a good bit less than some we've seen).  I've indicated
the number of bottles available.  These are due in a couple of months.

Plus some other outstanding 1999 Red Burgundies which have just arrived.
All are net priced.  Some (i.e. Mugneret and Pousse d'Or) are even
reasonable.

1. '99 DRC Vosne "Duvault-Blochet" (12) $149.99 net
2. '99 DRC Echezeaux (6) $179.99 net
3. '99 DRC Grands Echezeaux (6) $249.99 net
4. '99 DRC Romanee-St.-Vivant (6) $299.99 net
5. '99 DRC Richebourg (6) $399.99 net
6. '99 DRC La Tache (6) $499.99 net
7. '99 DRC Romanee-Conti (3) $2299.99 net

The DRC's director, Aubert de Villaine, considers these among the best wines
he has ever made.  In fact, as Burghound explains, he doesn't think it is
possible to have better grapes than he had in 1999.  These are historic
wines, and the demand for them unprecedented.

8. '99 de Vogue Chambolle-Musigny $59.99 net

Just one case left.  As you probably know, much of this is from very fancy
de-classified fruit.

9. '99 Mugneret Vosne-Romanee $39.99 net
10. '99 Mugneret Nuits "Chaignots" $49.99 net

Nobody makes purer, classier or more classic red Burgundies than Mugneret,
and these '99s are just beautiful.  The Nuits "Chaignots" is always a
favorite, and this is probably the most delicious I can remember.  And as
Tanzer says, the Vosne-Romanee is "rich and fine, with lovely fruit and
plaint texture.  This has superb fruit for a village wine."  These are red
Burgundies for purists, and are still quite affordable given the esteem of
this estate.  (At least they're affordable here; Tanzer prices them at $55
and $80.)

11. '99 Pousse d'Or Santenay "Clos Tavannes" $27.99 net
12. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "Clos de l'Audignac" $39.99 net
13. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "60 Ouvrees" $44.99 net
14. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay "Bousse d'Or" $49.99 net

1999 is the comeback vintage for this historic estate.  And the prices are
still remarkably reasonable for what's in the bottle.  Burghound (the only
American critic to review them so far, and a quite conservative one) rates
the Santenay "Clos Tavannes" 90 points.  It's absolutely delicious.  The
Volnay "Clos de l'Audignac" is 89-92: "positively effusive with its
exquisite nose of sexy, seductive black fruit and perfumed aromatics
followed by sexy, beautifully detailed and rich flavors of juicy, succulent
crushed berries and cassis.  Yet for all the fireworks, it somehow manages
to remain completely Volnay in character.  Lovely stuff."  If this sounds
good, it is.

And believe it or not, the top two Pousse d'Or monopolies, the famous "Clos
des Soixante-Ouvrees" and "Clos de la Bousse d'Or" are even better!  Once
again, these superb wines are among Volnay's elite.

November, adding to the inventory correction which will be positive for the=

followed by Continental Airlines. It will also be a big day for tech stocks=
 with Yahoo!, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple Computer, Compaq Computer, and =
Macromedia all reporting after the bell.  EUR/USD fell to a fresh 20-day lo=
w of 88.04 after falling below the key 89.10 level, which marks the 50% Fib=
onacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. This level is significa=

the JPY will be important to watch as most of EUR/USD losses come on the ba=
ck of a steep fall in EUR/JPY to a low of 115.67 from a high of 119.37 last=
 week, or a 3% drop. That's double the losses incurred by USD/JPY. In the m=
eantime, EUR/USD would have to break back above 89.50 for any hope of a nea=

 Monday's 2-week high of 1.4513 as losses vs JPY and losses in EUR/USD weig=

to push JPY lower.  USD/JPY rose to a day's high of 131.65, up from overnig=

was anticipated given the highly oversold position of the yen in recent wee=
ks as it fell 10 points in 6 weeks to a 3-year low of 133.37 against the do=
llar. Any correction in USD/JPY will have to hold above 130.40 to maintain =
its bullish trend, dealers say.  EUR/JPY was not as lucky, only rising to a=

R/JPY losses were more pronounced as it broke out of its steep 2-month up t=
rend from around 106 to a 2-year high of 119.71 on January 2. Since the eur=

vulnerable to a deeper retracement than USD/JPY. That was the case after EU=
R/JPY broke below support at 116.50. Resistance is now seen at 116.50 follo=

in advantages since it allows you to buy fractional shares of stocks: you c=
an invest small amounts in order to purchase stocks whose share prices are =
high, and you can make sure that all of your investment dollars are put to =

lanBuilder     [IMAGE]    Lesson 1 of 6: Are you ready to start investing i=
n stocks?   by Douglas Gerlach   Are you ready to start investing in stocks=
? Congratulations. Before you get going, however, there are a few essential=
 concepts you should understand first. Working with these basic concepts is=
 the key to becoming a successful investor. Once you understand the potenti=
al risks, rewards, and how to balance your choices in the market, you'll ha=
ve the right foundation to continue your education and pick stocks for your=
 portfolio.   [IMAGE] There Are No Guarantees  The first thing you need to =
know about investing is this: Whenever you invest, whether in stocks, bonds=
, or even if you simply keep your dollars in a money market fund, there is =
no guarantee you'll make a profit. With some investments, you could even lo=
se money, ending up with less than you started with. Armed with the right k=
nowledge, however, you can improve your odds of success significantly, bala=
ncing the risks of investing with the potential rewards.   [IMAGE] Balancin=
g Risk and Reward  Whenever you invest, you expose your money to some level=
 of risk. You might not think about it, but there is risk involved no matte=
r what you do with your money. Most people recognize that stashing their li=
fe savings under a mattress or in a cookie jar comes with the risk that the=
ir money could be stolen (where do you think burglars look first when they =
rob a house?) or destroyed (you might be able to find a fire-proof cookie j=
ar, but your bed is definitely not safe in that department).  Investing in =
the stock market has its own kinds of risks. A stock you purchase might go =
up or down in price (what's known as "fluctuation"). Stocks are volatile by=
 their very nature, and that's part of the inherent risk of investing in st=
ocks. In the worst case, a stock could even become worthless and cause you =
to lose 100% of your investment. However, it's important to recognize that =
there are different kinds of stocks, and some stocks are riskier than other=
s. You can't ever eliminate the risk associated with investing in stocks-bu=
t you can certainly tame it and even put some of those volatile tendencies =
to work for your benefit.   Keeping Up with Inflation  There is another imp=
ortant kind of risk to consider-- even if you're investing in bonds or just=
 keeping your money in the bank. There's the risk that your investment won'=
t grow fast enough to keep up with the effects of inflation. Over the years=
, inflation has grown at about three to four percent a year on average. If =
your money is sitting in a bank collecting interest at less than the rate o=
f inflation, then that money will actually be worth less when you withdraw =
it at some point down the road.   Not Being Afraid of Risk Whenever you see=
k higher returns, you must accept higher risk. The key is to balance the am=
ount of risk appropriate for your circumstances (what experts call your ris=
k tolerance) with the amount of reward you want to achieve. Every person ha=
s a different tolerance for risk, and it's up to you to decide for yourself=
 how to build a portfolio that will serve you best.  Historically, investin=
g in stocks offers the chance to earn higher returns than investing in bond=
s or keeping your money in the bank, but that opportunity comes with higher=
 risk. The essence of successful investing, though, is understanding and ac=
cepting the fact that risk is unavoidable -- and managing that risk so you =
can still sleep soundly at night.   [IMAGE]Investing, Dollar by Dollar   An=
 important concept that you can put to work when you use ShareBuilder  to i=
nvest in stocks is dollar-cost averaging. While this may sound like some co=
mplicated strategy, it's really not so difficult to understand. When you us=
e dollar-cost averaging, you automatically invest a fixed amount each week =
or month in the purchase of a single security. That's all there is to it!  =
Why is dollar-cost averaging such a good long-term strategy? Stock prices c=
an be volatile, rising and falling from week to week and month to month. Wh=
en you make a weekly or monthly purchase, the price of the stock may be hig=
her or lower than it was the month before. If you invest $100 a month, for =
example, then your $100 will buy fewer shares when the price is high and mo=
re shares when the price is low -- automatically. While dollar-cost averagi=
ng doesn't assure a profit, over time the average cost of your shares will =
generally tend to be lower than if you had made a single one-time investmen=
t of the same amount.   You might be using dollar-cost averaging right now =
without even knowing it. If you invest in a 401(k) or other retirement plan=
 at work, you contribute a fixed amount each pay period to your account, wh=
ich is then used to buy shares in one or more mutual funds. Over time, your=
 regular purchases will probably reduce the average cost you pay for all yo=
ur shares -- and that can help increase your returns.   You should recogniz=
e that dollar-cost averaging doesn't protect you from investment losses. An=
d a stock can decline until it's worthless -- so don't count on dollar-cost=
 averaging to protect you from the damage caused by buying a bad stock.  Sh=
areBuilder is designed to make dollar-cost averaging easy by allowing you t=
o buy in dollar amounts - dollar-based investing. When you buy stocks at a =
typical brokerage, you can only buy whole shares. If your chosen stock sell=
s for $70 a share, and you have $200 to invest, then you can only buy two s=
hares for $140 (plus commissions). The remaining $60 has to sit on the side=
lines until the next month (which means it can't be working for you in your=
 portfolio).   If you have $50 a month to invest at a typical brokerage, an=
d the stock you've selected currently sells for $85 a share, what do you do=
? Either you wait until you scrape together the remaining $35 (and hope the=
 price doesn't go higher), or you find another stock.  With ShareBuilder, d=
ollar-based investing means you can purchase fractional shares with the ent=
ire amount of your investment dollars. Your $200 will buy you 2.857 shares =
of your $70 stock (without commissions). Or your $50 will buy you 0.588 sha=
res of your $85 stock, so you don't have to put off investing until tomorro=
w.   [IMAGE] Putting It All Together  Understanding these three basic conce=
pts is key to becoming a successful investor.   You must be aware of the ri=
sks of investing. Understand how you can use strategies like dollar- cost a=
veraging to invest in stocks. If you invest with your eye on the long-term,=
 you can often ride out bumpy times in the market.  [IMAGE] Tomorrow:  Lear=

All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End Avenue

FROM:
Vincent Viola, Chairman
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
On-Going Air Quality Testing


Air Quality Update
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been and will continue
to be the first priority of this Exchange.  As we previously indicated, the
Exchange has engaged Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent
laboratory specializing in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality.
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on testing for dangerous
chemicals outside the building.  Air quality tests were performed on
September 14th, 20th, 26th, October 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 30th,
November 6th,  8th and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA,
OSHA, ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.

The air samples collected were tested for over 300 types and/or isomers of
chemicals including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for asbestos
structures, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, Acenaphtene, Acenaphthylene,
Anthracence, Benz (a) anthracene, Benz (a) pyrene, Benzo (b) fluorathene,
Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene, Dibenz (a,h)
anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene, Napthalene,
Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Manganese,
Nickel, Silica and Zinc.

Ambient Group, Inc., has also secured a high-volume air sampling monitor
that tested for air borne chemicals outside the building including
chlorinated dioxins, PCBs, brominated dioxims and polycyclic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).  The results from these reports indicated that the levels of these
individual compounds are below their respective standards and guidelines.

All test results are posted and made available to all building occupants on
a weekly basis.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Elliot
Zuckerman, Property Manager, at (212) 299-2242.

Please take a few moments to fill out the attached survey questions and you will be assisting our goal of providing the most resourceful tools to facilitate your trading.

By filling out this survey by noon EST on Wednesday, October 24th, 2001, you will automatically receive free access to all three of Forexnews.com's Technical Analysts' Market Services for 1 week:  Cornelius Luca's FX Technical Analysis, J.P. Chorek's Market Chronicles, and Technical Research Limited's Daily Forecast.

The survey can be accessed by going to: http://www.mgforex.com/survey/alertfx20011012.asp

 It also means the overnight sell-off was mostly a reaction to the market g=

To Our Readers:

Here's what's making headlines today:

U.S. bombing of Taliban targets was halted as diplomats stepped up talks
on the future of Afghanistan. The Northern Alliance said it has given the
Taliban a three-day ultimatum to surrender, while the U.S. is promising
more money to Afghans to reveal Osama bin Laden's whereabouts.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

Police in Spain believe they have made some of the most significant
arrests yet in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks.
http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/WTC_Investigation.html

Investigators believe anthrax-laced letters to Sen. Leahy and Sen. Daschle
came from same source.

Is anthrax misdiagnosis understandable?

Dan:  Neither credit nor legal has ever received info about the "Cayman branch" (if it is a branch) so we have never assessed that entity in full.  Treasa and Raj were trying to avoid use of that entity and trying to stick with CSFBI.  Sara

Subject:	RE: Oil Prepay Rollover

As I do not have any details of this deal, I cannot comment on the need for a carve out of margining rights. The only issue that I have been aware of is the Cayman branch possibility.  My comment on that to bothe Raj and Teresa was that if it is in fact a different legal entity (as determined by legal) then I will need financial information to make an assessment of this entity.  If it is a branch and part of CSFB International, which is sometimes the case with financial institutions, we would have recourse to CSFB International and it would be confirmed under the existing document. 

Regards,
Tanya

Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.  Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.

Sara/ Bob, 

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSFB here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was the case for the 2000 transaction earlier. 

Thanks very much for your help. 

Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

FROM:                    J. Robert Collins, Jr., President
 
SUBJECT:               AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 9.05 (MARGINS)
_________________________________________________________________________________          
 
Please  be advised that the Exchange has amended Rule 9.05, which governs Clearing  Members' use of money  market mutual funds to meet original margin requirements on the NYMEX  Division.  The amendments are shown  below and become effective today.   
 
Previously,  a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of approved  funds offered by the same issuer was limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25%  of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations.  
 
By  comparison, the new rule amendments delete this restriction, in effect allowing  a Clearing Member to meet 100% of its margin requirements with shares in one  money market fund.   
 
However,  the Clearing Member's participation in any such fund will be limited to 5% of  that money market fund.    
 
With regard to Rule 9.05, the Exchange continues to require that a money  market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply with CFTC  Regulation ? 1.25. 
 

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX Rule  9.05 (Margins)
 
(asterisk indicates additions; bracketing indicates  deletion)

(i)                   for purposes of original margin,  such shares will be valued at 95% of market value:
 
(ii)                a Clearing Member's  participation in any approved fund [or any group of approved funds  offered by the same issuer] shall be limited to [ the greater  of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's total original margin  obligations ]    *   no more than 5% of that  fund;   *

Notice Number: 01-391
November 21, 2001

TO:
ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
Emergency Rules - ScotiaMocatta Warrants


As a result of the attack on the World Trade Center and the inaccessibility
of the precious metals stored at ScotiaMocatta Depository ("SMD"), an
Exchange Licensed Depository, located in Four World Trade Center ("4WTC"),
the NYMEX Board of Directors implemented emergency rules pertaining to the
warrants issued by SMD.  In summary, these emergency rules permitted an
individual or firm taking delivery the option to reject a warrant for metal
on deposit at the SMD vault at 4WTC.

SMD has successfully relocated, using an Exchange Approved Carrier, all of
the precious metals stored at 4WTC to an SMD custodial account at the
Brink's Inc Exchange Licensed Depository and has applied to the Exchange to
establish a new Licensed Depository in New York City.

Therefore, the Exchange has, effectively immediately, rescinded the
emergency rules pertaining to the warrants issued by SMD.  As a result, the
Exchange Rules relating to warrants are those which were in effect prior to
the declaration of the emergency.

Prior to the establishment of its new facility as an Exchange-licensed
depository, SMD will offer its clients the options of leaving the metal in
storage; selling it to SMD; exchanging depository receipts for those of
another Exchange-licensed depository acceptable to ScotiaMocatta, with any
ounce differential cash-settled on the basis of a published price determined
by SMD; or delivering replacement metal to a mutually agreeable location, in
exchange for the metal at the ScotiaMocatta depository, subject to payment
by the client of the current price differential, as quoted by SMD.

Should you have any questions please contact Thomas LaSala at 212-299-2897,
Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Nick Galati at 212-299-2920.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the February 2002 options contract for Silver (SO
G2) and Gold (OG G2) is Friday, January 11, 2002.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on the previously
announced shortened trading hours.

Trading in the February 2002 Silver and Gold Options Contracts will cease at
1:25 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. respectively on January 11, 2002.  All Brokers and
Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise
or abandon such Options by 3:30 P.M.

On Friday, January 11, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 4:00 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:30 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning January 14, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:30 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

ta from the US. Resistance is seen at 88.00, 88.60 and even 88.80. But if t=

its own strength.   Tuesday's German Ifo business survey will also be key t=

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Joanne called in this morning with hardly a voice!  She said she coughed all night and is "going to bite the bullet and go to the doctor".   She will not be in today.

Reminder:  She will be out tomorrow as planned, using her Discretionary Holiday.

What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested could
be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

      Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
      amending
      the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

      Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
   the
      language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

      I trust this will now close the open issues.

      I look forward to hearing from you

      Daniel:

      Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
      relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
      If
      you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
   and
      we
      can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber
   of
      Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
      brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
      are
      not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
      other
      business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
      limitation
      of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

      "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or
   from
      any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
   special,
      punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

      Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of
   the
      office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

      All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
      executed
      together with the terms of business letter.

      Regards.  Sara

         Sara

         The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
      relationship
         with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
      relate
         to
         the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with
   the
      PB
         relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

         Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
         addressed
         in the documentation as drafted.

         I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
   possible
      so
         we
         can try to get this wrapped up today.

         Kind regards

         Daniel:

         Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
         conflict
         because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
   Par.8
         requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
      Terms
         of
         Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
   prevail.
         Are
         you agreeing with this analysis?

         Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
   conflict
         with
         the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the
   PB
         (except
         for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
      Enron
         Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
   the
         Terms
         of Business in the same manner.

         Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
      suggest a
         different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
         remaining
         documents.

            Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
   Arbitration -
         more
            appropriate to general terms of business which principally
         contemplate
            the
            regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
   event
      of
            inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
   A3).

            I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

            Kind regards

            Daniel

            Daniel:

            Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
      "Agreement")
            with my colleague Angela Davis.

            I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
         relating
            to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
   discussed
      but
            were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

            (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par.
   14
      of
            the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible
   use
      of
            arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in
   the
         OSLA)
            so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
      the
            Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
   English
         courts,
            I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which
   will
            prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

            (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
      manner
         as
            Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
   that
      you
            and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
      shouldn't
            these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

            I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of
   the
            account documentation.  Regards.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Thanks for your report.  I needed a format for my own "to do" list.  I asked Barbara to get more involved with the financial contracts and to get more visible with Ed and Don, so please take her with you to meetings etc.  Also Frank is going to let me know on Monday about rejoining us.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Happy Holidays to you and Welcome to Flowers Mail Order Group.   We have
received your request and will add you to our Waiting List.  We plan to send
out two Newsletters during the year, our Spring Offer mails in February, our
Fall Offer mails in August.
We have just completed our Fall 2001 Offer, the wines sold out quickly.
Currently there is no wine available for purchase.
We hope to be able to include you in our Spring 2002 offer.   We will do our
best.  Our wines are offered on a first come, first served basis.  When you
receive an offer and you decide to order, fax it back immediately to avoid
disappointment.  Until then, please keep us informed of any address changes.
Your patience is appreciated.
We invite your to visit our website at www.flowerswinery.com for more
information on all of our releases.
For special questions or observations about the wines, send us an e-mail us
for the quickest response. Thanks for your interest in Flowers wines.  We
look forward to hearing from you.
Regards, Michelle

P.S.  We are located in such a remote area of the Sonoma Coast that our
County Permit does not allow us visitors.  Once our wine is bottled, it is
shipped off premise to the warehouse until release.  We have no bottled wine
on premise and no tasting facility.  We respect these conditions of our
permit to enable us to continue to grow great wine in this area.  The best
way to visit is through our website.  Thanks.

Dear Sara,
Our upcoming exhibition of Kirk Hayes' wonderful paintings 
(his first show in Houston) will mark our 25th anniversary, 
and it will also be our final exhibition in Houston ! 
 
Early this summer, Gary and I will move the gallery and our residence 
to southern Arizona.  We've had a wonderful 25+ year run in Houston 
and we're sad to be leaving our many friends and supporters, 
but new adventures beckon.  We're looking forward to many visitors 
once we get settled.  More details to follow regarding our new location, etc.... 
Our final schedule is as follows-
14 Artists  through February 23
FotoFest: Doherty, Sparagana & Stautberg  March 1-30
Our 25th anniversary Swansong event- 
Kirk Hayes: new paintings  April 5-May 4
6! 
Let me know if there's anything you can't (or shouldn't) live without.    
Best, Kathleen

Sara,

We are beginning the process of contacting each of the 31 "Live" and "Performing" counterparts.  Prior to contacting them, Louis and I would like your perspective on any points that need to be discussed (or areas to avoid).  

Hopefully, we could get together today if it works with your schedule.

March 5,  2002
 
To:               All  NYMEX Division Members
                    NYMEX Division Member Firms
 
From:          J. Robert Collins, Jr., President
 
 
Re:        Request for assistance in communicating the importance of the  weekly natural gas storage report to the Department of  Energy
 
 
The U.S. Department of  Energy Energy Information Administration (EIA) will take over the release of the  weekly natural gas storage report from the American Gas Association this  spring.  Since its inception in  1993, the survey has been an important source of on-going changes in the supply  and demand of natural gas, and plays an important role in the transparency of  the market.  While at the present  time the report is released during open outcry trading hours, the Exchange has  reason to believe that the EIA is leaning toward releasing the numbers in the  late afternoon or on the weekend.   Officials at the EIA have said they believe this will minimize the  volatility in the marketplace.
 
It is the firm belief of the  Exchange that releasing the weekly storage report in the off-hours will only  increase market volatility upon the resumption of open outcry trading, will  limit market transparency, and would put many market participants at a  disadvantage.  In the interests of  market transparency and fairness, the Exchange is concerned that the report be  released during open outcry trading hours when the market is most liquid, and  has suggested a time of 10:30 A.M. 
 
The Exchange has made  its position known in written comments to the Department of Energy.  EIA Administrator Mary Hutzler has said  that the Exchange appears to be the only interested party that feels strongly  about releasing the data during regular trading hours. 
 
It is important that market  participants, particularly commercial entities, contact the EIA on this  issue.  I urge you and your  customers to call Ms. Hutzler, (202) 586-6351, and cordially explain how  important it is to have the information made available during regular daytime  trading hours, preferably 10:30 A.M.  Please make the following  points:
 
?  The weekly inventory report is an  important source of information regarding changes in the supply and demand of  natural gas.  It is currently  released to coincide with regular daytime trading hours of the natural gas  futures market. 
 
?  Wide participation in the New York  Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures market by commercial buyers and sellers  from all segments of the industry has made the futures contract the North  American pricing benchmark.
 
?  The release of the report in the late in  the afternoon, or early in the morning when the trading floor is closed, will  put most market participants at a distinct disadvantage to those firms who have  trading desks manned round the clock.
 
?  The release of the information in the  off hours could also increase volatility at the opening of the market -- having  the opposite of the desired effect.
 
?  In the interests of fairness and market  transparency, it is vital that the statistics continue to be released according  to current practice, during daytime trading; one of the most active times of the  day is shortly after the market open, or about 10:30 A.M.        
 
If you prefer to fax Ms.  Hutzler at (202) 586-0329, or email mary.hutzler@eia.doe.gov, we have provided  the following recommended language:
 
 
Ms. Mary  Hutzler
Administrator  
Energy Information  Administration
U.S. Department of Energy  
Washington, DC  
 
Dear Ms.  Hutzler:
 
Since its inception in 1993,  the American Gas Association's weekly inventory survey has been an important  source of on-going changes in the supply and demand of natural gas, and has  fulfilled an important role in assuring the transparency of the market.  We understand that the reporting  function will be assumed by the Energy Information Administration this spring,  and wish to urge that in the interest of market fairness and efficiency that the  weekly report continue to be released during regular daytime trading hours of  the natural gas futures market.
 
Wide participation in the  New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures market by commercial buyers and  sellers of gas from all segments of the industry has made the futures contract  the North American pricing benchmark for this important energy resource.  For this reason, we feel that it is  vital that the statistics continue to be released according to current practice,  during regular daytime trading hours, the most active trading period.  Typically, one of the most active times  of the day would be shortly after the market opens, about 10:30 A.M.  
 
A release of the inventory  figures in the late afternoon or on the weekend would primarily benefit the  major companies that can afford to man round-the-clock trading desks because  they will be able to react immediately, while smaller firms will have to wait  until the market opens on the following business day.  It has been our experience that the  release of market-moving news in the off-hours often increases market volatility  at the market open.
 
We urge you to maintain the  current practice of releasing this information during daytime  trading.
 
Thank you for your  consideration.
 
                                                                                        Sincerely,

markets should determine currency exchange rates. Nonetheless, O'Neill emph=
asized that manipulating FX rates would not solve Japan's economic difficul=
ties. In addition, O'Neill reaffirmed that the US was committed to its "str=

of the greenback's initial strong performance, the euro and Swiss franc had=

remarks on the economy and any clues they might glean about the central ban=

uary 11 speech. This was confirmed today by Dallas Fed President McTeer who=
 said that Greenspan's speech on January 11 was not quite as negative as so=
me thought. McTeer also pointed out that the US economy is looking much bet=
ter than it was 2 months ago. According to the sources, the Fed Chairman is=
 likely to comment more positively about the current state of the US econom=
y on Thursday, and therefore markets are now pricing in less than a 30% cha=

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

in the meantime (and don't shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEF

Subject:	Investment companies

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms

All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the November 2001 options contract for Aluminum (OA
X1) is Thursday, October 25, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.


TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on shortened
trading hours as described in Notice to Members # 01-333
(http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_333.htm).

Trading in the November 2001 Aluminum Options Contract will cease at 1:05
P.M. on October 25, 2001.  All Brokers and Traders must inform their
Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise or abandon such Options by
3:00 P.M.

On Thursday, October 25, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Thursday's submissions and processing will be
available on Friday morning October 26, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

It appears that the only position under this CP's GTC expired in Feb02.  Therefore the only issue on Empire is the A/R of $210.00.  In our list we show this CP with a status of "expired."  No need to send termination letter.

Susan: please update the Demand Letter Log - 
	Termination Letter column: Expired
	Comment column: $210 A/R outstanding

Tom:

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Apparently CSFB neglected to ask us to complete the attached corporate resolution when we executed the broker agreement.  If we could fill out and forward on that would be great.

Notice No. 02-29
February 4, 2002

TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members

The expiration date for the March 2002 options contract for Silver (SO H2)
and Gold (OG H2) is Friday, February 8, 2002.

	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.


	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the March 2002 Silver and Gold Options Contracts will cease at
1:25 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. respectively on February 8, 2002.  All Brokers and
Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise
or abandon such Options by 3:30 P.M.

On Friday, February 8, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 4:00 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:30 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning February 11, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:30 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing

		ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	Approved Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94, "Settlement Price
Procedures for Copper Contracts"


The Exchange has complied with regulatory requirements by filing with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94,
"Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts".  The approved amendments
to Rule 4.94 modify the settlement price procedure for the current delivery
month by taking into consideration, not only the weighted average price
(rounded to the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transaction
that occur in the closing range, but also the weighted average for all
spreads executed and all spread bids and offers actively represented between
the most active month and the current delivery month during the final thirty
minutes of trading.

A copy of the amended Rule 4.94 is attached.  These Rule amendments will
become effective on Monday, October 29, 2001.

Should you have any questions please contact Michael Campanelli at
212-299-2072, Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at
212-299-2334.

Approved Rule Amendments
(Asterisk indicates additions: bracketing indicates deletions)

Rule 4.94	Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts.

	(A)(i) The term "base month" shall mean the March, May, July,
September, and December delivery months; (ii) the term "most active month"
with respect to this rule and the rules of COMEX Chapters 11 and 17 shall
mean the base month that is not the current delivery month, with the
greatest reported open interest on the official COMEX daily open interest
report.

* (B)   The settlement price for the current delivery month shall be
comprised of the weighted average price (rounded to the nearest minimum
fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in the closing range
combined with the weighted average price of all spreads executed between the
current delivery month and the most active month and all spread bids and
offers between the current delivery month and the most active month actively
represented during the final 30 minutes of trading.  If no outright
transactions occur in the closing range or no spreads are executed or there
are no spread bids and offers actively represented during the final 30
minutes of trading in the current delivery month, the settlement price shall
be the last trade price, unless during the closing range a bid higher or
offer lower than the last trade price is made.  In such event, such higher
bid or lower offer shall be the settlement price. *

	[(B)] *(C) *  The settlement price for the [current delivery month
and the] most active month shall be the weighted average price (rounded to
the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in
the closing range.  If no outright transactions occur in the closing range
of [either the current delivery month and] the most active month, the
settlement price [for the applicable month] shall be the last trade price,
unless during the closing range a bid higher or offer lower than the last
trade price is made.  In such event, such higher bid or lower offer shall be
the settlement price.

	[(C)] *(D)*  In all other delivery months, the settlement prices
shall be determined based upon spread relationships between and among
contract months, which relationships shall be determined in the judgment of
the Settlement Price Committee with:  (a) greater weight given to spreads
executed late in the trading day in large volumes, and (b) lesser weight
given to (i) spreads traded in lesser volumes, (ii) spread bids and offers
actively represented late in the trading day, and (iii) spread transactions,
bids and offers from earlier in the trading day.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than
the best outright bid, or higher than the best outright offer, that:  (a)
was for at least 20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and
had remained available for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes
of trading of that trading day.

	[(D)] *(E)*  If any settlement price, determined pursuant to
Paragraph [(C)] *(D)*, is inconsistent with transactions that occurred
during the closing range for other delivery months of the same futures
contract or with other market information known to the Committee, the
Committee may establish a settlement price at a level consistent with such
other transactions or market information.  In such event, the Committee
shall prepare a written record of the basis for any settlement price so
established.

Fed meeting, Greenspan is likely to keep the easing bias to avoid the probl=
em BoE Governor George ran into with markets driving yields higher on overz=

ut the euro back in full bear mode. Support is seen at 86.30, 86.15, and 85=
.60. Resistance is viewed at 86.60, 87.10, and 87.85.  GBP/USD broke below =
support at 1.4180 after and revisted an overnight 2-week low around 1.4150 =
after BoE Governor George today tried again to talk down the currency. Geor=
ge said sterling strength exacerbates the imbalances the central bank would=
 like to correct. Therefore, a fall would help the BoE do its job to get th=
e economy on one track again.  Usually central bankers like a strong curren=
cy because it allows for lower interest rates and flexibility on monetary p=
olicy. But with RPIX running near their target of 2.5%, George appears more=
 concerned with the UK's two-speed economy. He repeated that "unbalanced gr=

t consumer spending could moderate sharply. Therefore, sterling remains wea=
k after back-to-back surprise declines in UK retail sales were seen as a si=

p contrast with the upbeat outlook for the US. Although risks to a sharp fa=

of the MPC pleases the market more than the conservative approach of the EC=
B. EUR/GBP was little changed around 61 pence.  Yesterday's downward revisi=
on to UK GDP showed the economy was flat in Q4, down from a preliminary est=
imate of 0.2% growth. The revision caught traders off guard, but did not pr=
ovoke a break of key support at 1.4140. Follow up support is viewed at 1.41=
0 and 1.4075. Upside capped at 1.4260, 1.430 and 1.4345.  Meanwhile, USD/JP=
Y fell to a day's low of 133.57 in early London trade amid profit taking af=
ter encountering strong resistance around the 135 area overnight and a rema=
rk from Japan's top financial diplomat that the dollar was unlikely to drop=
 sharply. Repatriation concerns also limiting dollar gains, but with repatr=
iation poised to slow near the end of March and net outward investment to r=
esume thereafter dealers expect to see further yen weakness in the weeks to=
 come allowing USD/JPY to target 140 once the 135.00/20 major resistance ba=
nd is broken. Upside capped at 134.70/85 and strong resistance at 135.15. S=
upport holds at 133.50, 133.20, 133.0 and 132.50.  The Bank of Japan's deci=
sion to increase its outright JGB purchases to one trillion yen a month fro=
m 800 billion also had an initial supportive effect as it was seen easing f=
unding pressures next month. But the yen's gains evaporated as markets saw =
little hope in the Japanese government's anti-deflation package.  The yen s=
hould not fall too much from the increase in liquidity even though it is su=
pposed to mean a weaker yen because there is more of the currency circulati=
ng. Instead, since increasing liquidity in Japan is ineffectual amid struct=
ural barriers causing rampant deflation and lack of demand the yen has resp=
onded less and less to recent increases in liquidity, because it is not lea=
ding to inflation and therefore not diminishing the value of the yen.  Desp=
ite BoJ Governor Hayami's remark that today's easing was not politically mo=
tivated, Hayami has made public his desire now for the government to inject=
 public funds into the troubled banking sector. Whether there was a quid pr=
o quo agreement remains to be seen. PM Koizumi's anti-deflation package avo=
ided any concrete plan to rescue banks but Hayami worries that without a re=
capitalization Japanese banks will be threatened with losing international =
banking licenses because their capital ratios have fallen to below internat=
ional standards.  Government has tried to avoid a publicly unappealing tax =
payer fund injection, instead opting for creating a floor under asset price=
s which will keep banks capital adequacy ratios above the 8% limit set by t=
he BIS. But an injection of funds would allow banks to write off non-perfor=
ming loans and improve their balance sheets. Therefore, the government's pl=

racement of the 115.75-135.15 move provided a solid base for a corrective r=

the 50% retracement of the same move. More importantly, the yen is approach=
ing its 200-day moving average of 125 for the first time since November.  M=
eanwhile, the government's resolve to boost Japanese assets ahead of March =
31 is likely to fend off any negative news that comes its way. Case in poin=
t was today's 2% rise in the Nikkei despite Japan's Q4 GDP which fell 1.2% =
q/q and was the first time in nearly a decade that output had fallen three =
quarters in a row. The figure attracted little attention and instead, talk =
of a global recovery has sparked a wave of foreign money coming into Japan =

ms. Therefore, there still remains doubt as to whether the Nikkei can maint=
ain its recent gains after the March 31 fiscal year end and whether the spe=
ctacular rise in yen on speculative trading will come undone over the next =
few weeks. BoJ Governor Hayami alluded to this today when he said he expect=
ed the market to be stable through the end of March, but did not say what c=
ould happen afterwards.  USD/JPY fell nearly 5% this week alone, while EUR/=
JPY fell only 3%. This gap has been filled by the 2 cent rise in EUR/USD an=
d supports the notion that rise in the yen is strictly a Japan-driven play =
rather than a global growth-driven play. The enforcement of anti-short-sell=
ing laws in Japan and the rebound in the Nikkei enhances the yen repatriati=
on play.  EUR/USD fell to a day's low of 87.80 as it retreated from an over=
night high of 88.40. On Thursday, the market ignored the European Central B=
ank's decision to keep rates steady at 3.25%. Markets had anticipated the c=
entral bank would take no action due to growing signs of Eurozone economic =
recovery and rising inflationary pressures. But despite the recent rise in =
EUR/USD, the dollar's weakness is primarily contained to the yen. Neverthel=

f This Week's Data by Jes Black  At 2:00 PM US Sept Fed Budget (exp 27.1 bl=
n, prev  79.9)  Confidence in the dollar started to slip away last Thursday=
 as investors braced for a potentially poor round of economic data this wee=
k. It all starts with consumer confidence on Tuesday and ends with the Octo=
ber jobs report on Friday. But USD saw more than a little profit taking in =
the European session on Monday as traders squared positions ahead of the st=
orm.  EUR/USD rose to a one-week high of 89.92, just lacking the momentum t=
o get it over the 92-cent mark. The other European majors rose in tandem, c=
limbing to respective one-week highs of $1.4479 against the pound and 1.641=
1 Swiss francs to the dollar. Sterling also benefited from speculation of M=
&A-related inflows. News that U.S. finance house Babcock & Brown may bid fo=
r British rail network operator Railtrack and a weekend newspaper report th=
at German media giant Bertelsmann was eyeing Britain's Carlton Communicatio=
ns added to sterling's appeal, after better than expected GDP data last wee=
k. But more surprisingly was the yen's resilience in the face of a further =
downgrade by the Bank of Japan and their decision to not try and help the e=
conomy with more easy monetary policy. USD/JPY fell to a session low of 122=
.13, but regained key support around 122.25 later in the European session. =
 Given the past two week's of optimism in the face of weak earnings reports=
, US economic data this week will give a better clue as to how severe the d=
ownturn will be. Most forecasts are expected to show sharp declines and con=
firm the US edged closer to recession after the September 11 attacks on the=
 United States. Final October releases include the Conference Board's confi=
dence survey, Chicago PMI, NAPM, the Labor report, this week's jobless clai=
ms and the key Q3 GDP preliminary report. This will be the most widely watc=
hed release because if the Q3 GDP figure proves to be worse than the negati=
ve 0.9% expected, it will have a doubly harsh effect on USD as traders also=
 anticipate a larger decline in the October Labor report.   In contrast, ha=
lf the Eurozone nations will be on holiday this Thursday, which will lead t=
o thin markets and high volatility with the bulk of US data due on Wednesda=
y and Thursday. Therefore, downside risks to USD are enhanced, with only UK=
 and Eurozone PMI data to weigh on the euro and pound this week. Comments f=
rom ECB member and Bundesbank president Welteke echoed the ECB's recent ass=
essment by saying the central bank would  cut rates if it could do so witho=
ut hurting price stability. Welteke also saw Eurozone economic growth signi=
ficantly below potential at the present and that a return to long term grow=
th of 2.5% will be delayed. But, expansionary effects of this years interes=
t rate cuts are still in pipeline, he said.  Meanwhile, Q3 company earnings=
 reports will continue to play an important role in this week's US stock ma=
rket and therefore the dollar. So far, over 3/4 of the companies reporting =
matched or exceeded projected earnings targets, albeit for drastically lowe=
r forecasts. A majority of companies are reporting after the bell and given=
 this week's upcoming data, trade is likely to be thin ahead going into Wed=
nesday. Both Dow and Nasdaq futures are in negative territory.  Today's ble=
ak economic and inflation outlook in Japan also failed to spur investors to=
 go long the dollar against the yen. USD  was unable to benefit from the Ba=
nk of Japan's decision to keep monetary policy unchanged despite their fore=
cast of a deteriorating economy and rising deflationary concerns. The BoJ's=
 decision to hold interest rates near zero (ZIRP) and maintain a floor of 6=
 trillion yen in reserves did not impress FX markets.   But inaction was ex=
pected and offers to sell USD above 122.50 capped any dollar gains. Dealers=
 say failure to extend gains beyond 123 level indicates that a minor top ha=
s been formed around last week's two-month high of 123.35. USD/JPY support =
seen at 122.30/40, and a break of 122.25/30 opens the way for a breach of t=
he key 122.00 level, from which point most traders based their new long pos=
itions and where stop loss orders are likely to be placed. USD/JPY now hove=
ring around 122.30.  The BoJ also offered a sharp downward revision in its =
own economic growth and price outlooks for fiscal 2001 and 2002, saying the=
 economy was in a "severe" adjustment phase. The Bank expects a further fal=
l in exports and output to affect domestic demand in the second half of thi=
s fiscal year and not reach a bottom until the second half of FY02/03. Afte=
r that, the bank expects exports to recover, but sees prices on continued, =
gradual declining trend in FY01/02, and FY02/03. The BoJ board's full outlo=
ok for FY01/02 GDP ranged from -1.6% to -0.6%. FY01/02 CPI ranged from -1.3=
% to -0.9%. However, the bank's own figures are not seen as making any diff=
erence in monetary policy because BoJ Governor Hayami sees structural refor=
m as the key to growth, not more money.  In other news, Finance Minister Sh=
iokawa said the government will still aim for the 30 trillion JGB cap, but =
should remain flexible to unforeseen changes in economic environment. But w=
orrying markets is what those "unforeseen changes" might be. If that includ=
es today's downward revision to growth and inflation, then markets will be =
very disappointed with the new Koizumi government's promise of reform. Any =
violation of this key reform is likely to push the yen lower.  Shiokawa als=
o said standards should be set for banks to foreclose on borrowers with exc=
essive debts. "There are companies that are borrowing from banks that haven=
't paid any dividends to shareholders for some years, whose debts have been=
 forgiven, but are still unable to recover. Banks should be able to foreclo=
se on such firms," he said. "There should be a set of standards that makes =
it easier for banks to do so. That would be one way of resolving bad loans.=
" The Financial Services Agency has been leading efforts to resolve the mas=
sive bad loans at banks as part of the government's plans to restructure th=

To Our Readers:

Here's what's making headlines in the United States and overseas today:

In a newly-released videotaped message, Osama bin Laden says his agents
are carrying out "blessed terrorism." U.S. officials dismissed his remarks
as "ludicrous." The full 30-minute tape is due to be broadcast today at
1:30 p.m. ET. Get full coverage at ABCNEWS.com.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_binladentape011227.html

While Osama bin Laden is still a wanted man, military leaders have changed
one key element of the hunt: U.S. Marines will not conduct a cave-to-cave
search of the Tora Bora mountain region.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

French authorities are reconstructing Richard Reid's movements in Paris in
the days before he allegedly tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight last
week. Officials believe the information could lead them to an al Qaeda
cell.

Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Kim

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested could be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

Daniel:  With respect to the Terms of Business Letter, please email a copy
of the proposed side letter (to handle arbitration and limitation of
liability).  I just want to review the "final product".  We have all other
documents ready for immediate execution.  Sorry for the delay and I

   Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
   amending
   the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

   Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
   language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

   I trust this will now close the open issues.

   I look forward to hearing from you

   Kind regards

   Daniel

   Daniel:

   Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
   relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
   If
   you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and
   we
   can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
   Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
   brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
   are
   not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
   other
   business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
   limitation
   of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

   "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
   any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,

      Sara

      The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
   relationship
      with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
   relate
      to
      the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the
   PB
      relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

      Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
      addressed
      in the documentation as drafted.

      I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible
   so
      we
      can try to get this wrapped up today.

      Kind regards

      Daniel

      Daniel:

      Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
      conflict
      because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
      requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
   Terms
      of
      Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
      Are
      you agreeing with this analysis?

      Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
      with
      the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
      (except
      for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
   Enron
      Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
      Terms
      of Business in the same manner.

      Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
   suggest a
      different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
      remaining
      documents.

      Thanks.

         Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
      more
         appropriate to general terms of business which principally
      contemplate
         the
         regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event
   of
         inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

         I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

         Kind regards

         Daniel:

         Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
   "Agreement")
         with my colleague Angela Davis.

         I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
      relating
         to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed
   but
         were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

         (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14
   of
         the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use
   of
         arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
      OSLA)
         so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
   the
         Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
      courts,
         I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
         prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

         (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
   manner
      as
         Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that
   you
         and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
   shouldn't
         these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

         I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
         account documentation.  Regards.

Dear Shareholder:

As a follow up to today's email to stockholders, I want to provide you with
the underlying assumptions used to produce the annual rates of return
contained in the graph.
The annual rate of return is calculated by comparing the (i) annual
appreciation of a seat and (ii) the lease revenue (based upon the cumulative
monthly average for a 6-month lease) generated for a calendar year with
(iii) the purchase price at the beginning of a calendar year. For instance,
if you bought a seat at the last seat price in 1999 ($690,000) and leased it
at the average lease rate over the course of a year, the amount of revenue
you would receive, taking annual appreciation into account, would provide a
20% annual rate of return as of the last day of 2000.

Sincerely,
J. Robert Collins, Jr.
President

an Retail Sales Ex autos (exp 0.2%, prev -0.1%)  The dollar held steady aga=
inst the European majors today as market participants await today's US reta=
ils sales report for January. But the dollar gave up more ground against th=
e yen as the Japanese continue to repatriate funds ahead of March. Today's =
warning by Moody's rating agency that it was prepared to downgrade Japan's =
domestic yen rating as early as next month helped solidify fears amongst th=
e Japanese. Meanwhile, fading weak yen rhetoric and a stabilizing Nikkei he=
lped shore up the sell off of Japanese assets, thereby lending support to t=
he yen.  Initially, USD/JPY rose to a day's high of 133.37 following the ne=
ws that the downgrade would be at least two notches from the current Aa3. H=
owever, the yen was able to rise to a day's high of 132.23 after tripping s=
top loss orders around USD/JPY support at 132.50. EUR/JPY fell to a low of =
115.73, down from a day's high of 116.80 and well off Tuesday's high of 117=
.52. USD/JPY support now seen at 132.20 followed by 131.90 and 131.20.  USD=
/JPY is likely to trade in a range between 130 to 135 into the month of Mar=
ch. Despite the fact that the market is convinced of further yen weakness t=
o come this year, JPY remains supported in the short term. JPY losses shoul=
d also be contained to 135 against the dollar now that Japanese officials e=
ased off their weak yen policy last week.  Moreover, USD/JPY came off Monda=
y's high of 135 after this weekend's announcement that the government might=
 inject as much as $US 78 billion into the financial sector. This has halte=
d the sell off in Japanese assets by foreign investors we saw last month. T=
he Nikkei rose over 4% from last weeks lows.  Recent data from the MoF show=
s that in January, foreigners' net Japan bond selling rose to Y1.2368 trln =
from a mere Y172.22 bln in December. Therefore, this side of the repatriati=
on equation has settled down and JPY should remain supported by recent capi=
tal flows data for February which showed Japanese investors sold an unusual=
ly large 575.6 billion yen ($4.30 billion) in foreign securities last week,=
 the sixth straight week of net sales. This should keep Japanese repatriati=
on fears until the end of March when the fiscal year ends.  Meanwhile, the =
dollar traded steady against the European majors today as dealers await tod=
ay's US retails sales report for January. Declining vehicle sales and low g=
as prices will weigh on total January retail sales growth, which is expecte=
d at flat to slightly negative. However, excluding auto sales, core retail =
sales should show its first a slight rise as consumer confidence remains st=
rong. Markets are therefore anxious to know how the consumer reacted in Jan=
uary after a strong spending binge in December. A better than expected figu=
re would be bullish for the dollar as it would show one cannot underestimat=
e the US consumer   even in a recession.  EUR/USD held near a day's low of =
87.41, which marks key support for the pair. On Tuesday, offers at 88.00/10=
 kept a cap on EUR/USD again after Monday's wave of stop-loss buying failed=
 to develop into more sustainable demand for the euro. A break below 87.40 =
would target 87.10/00 and a break of that level would be the first strong c=
onfirmation of resumption in the euro's bear trend.  Yet, even if the euro =
holds above 87.40, it still needs to clear 88 cents followed by key resista=
nce at 88.75/80 to remove its bearish outlook. That level marks the 61.8% r=
etracement of this year's high to low of 90.63 to 85.63. Looking forward, u=
nless the single currency can rise above the 88.80-cent level, its momentum=
 should wane and turn back south again.  The euro also added to losses agai=
nst the pound as it fell to a new low of 60.99 pence. The euro began to wea=
ken against the pound after a test of 61.95 last Friday was rejected. Tuesd=
ay's break below 61.55 support triggered stop loss sales on its way to a lo=
w of 61.32. Therefore, renewed pressure on the pair could carry it back tow=
ards this month's lows around 60.68 pence. This would cause the euro to giv=
e up any further gains on the back of a rise in GBP/USD.  Sterling rose to =
a new 3-week high of 1.4362 following surprisingly upbeat UK jobs data whic=
h raised the expectations of the Bank of England raising rates later this y=
ear. Official data showed UK unemployment unexpectedly fell back by seasona=
lly-adjusted 10,600 in January, instead of rising. Tuesday's jump in inflat=
ion data also highlighted buoyant domestic economy and fanned expectations =
of higher interest rates, which tend to benefit sterling.   However, the po=
und gave up some of those gains after the BoE's inflation report cited litt=
le risk to rising interest rates as long as the risks to growth remain to t=
he downside. The bank said in its inflation report that it sees RPIX to tre=
nd near the targeted 2.5% by year end and for GDP to rise to around trend o=

Sara:

I think we should get w/ R Baumfield and M Ellenberg to complete the decision tree on trading contracts analysis we started last week.

Per a dicussion I had with Sheila last night, I am setting up a meeting with the participants last week to finish the decision tree tomorrow when Mark is back here in Houston.

In the meantime, I am happy to discuss the topic with you today with Richard Baumfield.

Alan

Can we have a short meeting to identify our immediate path for trade termination?  I'm not certain of the critical steps required before we can begin to respond.  

I have a short list of questions.

I apologize if you covered this in yesterday's meeting.  Thanks.

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

Importance:	High

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

Subject:	Investment companies

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

Notice No:  02-59
February 15, 2002



To:		NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Members

From:		Barry Loyal
		Human Resources Department

Subject:	Members' Group Long Term Disability Renewal


Effective March 1, 2002 the Members' Group Long -Term Disability plan will
be renewed with UNUM insurance company. As a result of poor claims
experience, the cost to maintain disability coverage for the membership has
increased dramatically. As a result, changes had to be made in order to
maintain this program for our Members.

The changes that will take effect March 1, 2002 are set forth below:

_ Mental/Nervous Disorder or Alcohol/Drug related disabilities would be
covered for 12 months instead of 24 months.

? The Elimination/Waiting period before one starts to receive benefits will
increase from 90 to 180 days.

? The final change relates to the offset of payments under the members'
disability policy should a member have other Group Disability insurance
policies. Commencing March 1, 2002 the policy will provide that if a Member
begins to receive benefits and has another Group Disability policy, payments
received under such other Group Disability policies would reduce benefits
received under the NYMEX policy. Please note that if you own an individual
policy that is not issued through a group or association it will not be
effected or reduced by any group policy.

These changes were necessary in order to keep our program in place for the
future. The rates that we were able to negotiate are only guaranteed for one
year and we hope that our claims experience improves so that we can maintain
this program at a competitive price for years to come.

For your information a summary sheet on the benefits offered members is
attached.

If you have any questions regarding these plan changes and how they might
affect you, please contact Warren Rosen at 212.949-9200. You may also call
me at 212-299-2203.

Notice No. 01-437
December 20, 2001

TO:		All ACCESS/C21 Frame Relay Users

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 Frame Relays


Thank you for your patience and understanding concerning the frame relay
equipment issue.  I'm pleased to inform you that the Exchange has made a
final decision on the disposition of this equipment.

Please be advised that AT&T will be contacting you shortly to arrange for
disconnection and removal of the router and modem only for those NYMEX
ACCESS
 and C-21 users connecting to our systems via frame relay.  This is
AT&T's equipment and they will arrange for its pickup.  Users are
responsible for the costs associated with any AT&T equipment that might be
damaged or lost.

All NYMEX ACCESS
 terminal holders must contact their telephone carrier to
arrange for the discontinuance of phone service to their terminal.  Since
the user set up the account with AT&T, they are responsible for contacting
the carrier and making arrangements for this service to be discontinued.
The Exchange will not do this.  This should be completed as quickly as
possible since the Exchange will not pay for any reimbursement costs
incurred after December 31, 2001.

Finally, with reference to the NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 terminal equipment
itself, the Exchange requires that NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 frame relay
holders write or email the NYMEX Customer Service Call Center (NCSCC) with
their intention to return the equipment to the Exchange at their own cost,
or to keep the equipment and continue using it for NYMEX ACCESS
  and / or
C-21 usage.

To contact NYMEX Customer Service, call: #1-800-438-8616 or e-mail:
CUSTCARE@nymex.com.
To send your response via post, please mail to:
New York Mercantile Exchange
Customer Service Department
World Financial Center
One North End Avenue
14th Floor
New York, NY 10282
Attention: Robert Dagistino, Director and/or Mildred Rodriguez, Business
Analyst

Should you decide to keep the equipment and continue to use C-21 and/or
NYMEX ACCESS
, please be advised that effective December 31, 2001 any
license granted to the C-21 and NYMEX ACCESS
 software programs or any
third-party software that may be accessed via the terminal equipment shall
terminate.  Any use of these software programs after that date or any
copying or re-distribution of these programs is strictly prohibited.  To
continue using the equipment, you must format the hard drive and install any
operating system that supports Internet Explorer 5.1 or greater.

Should you have any questions please contact the NCSCC at 1-800-438-8616 or
e-mail at CUSTCARE@nymex.com.

Thank you for your continued support.

1.6880.  Economic data on Monday showed the Swiss January jobless rate rose=
 to 2.6% from 2.4% in December, as expected. Recent comments from the Swiss=
 National Bank show they are still concerned by the strong Swiss franc agai=
nst the euro due to the pressure on trade. Blattner also rejected an exchan=

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading

Members

The expiration date for the April 2002 options contract for Silver (SO J2)

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the April 2002 Silver and Gold Options Contracts will cease at
1:25 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. respectively on March 8, 2002.  All Brokers and
Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise
or abandon such Options by 3:30 P.M.

On Friday, March 8, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a duly
authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 4:00 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:30 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning March 11, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:30 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

Sara,

Is it possible to get a soft copy of the revised termination letter we discussed a couple of days ago?  We would like to see the paragraph referencing how the counterparty arrived to the calculated amount and the request for supporting list of transactions.

Thanks.
Nony

h's 2-year high of 119.71. Support is seen at 118.65, 118.30 and 118.00.  K=
uroda also said Japan, "needs to tackle structural reform in three areas: i=

 in deregulation, to spur investment in new business; and in fiscal consoli=
dation."    Moreover, he discounted recent concerns from Asian neighbors, s=

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

Sara,

I wanted to follow up with you to find out if you are still planning to send an example contract to me for transactions involving RMT.  If you plan to send it interoffice mail, I am in EB 1709.

Thanks,

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Monday, December 31, 2001, is the First Notice Day,
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of January
2002 (the new spot month).

On Friday, December 28, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers
and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry
("OLTE") system trained representative available until such time as the
Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

US. operatives are in northern Afghanistan in an early step towards
forging political and military links with opposition groups fighting the
Taliban, ABCNEWS has learned.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

The investigation into who is sending "anthrax letters" focuses on West
Trenton, N.J., where two postal workers have the skin form of anthrax.
Dozens of investigators will go mailbox to mailbox searching for clues.

To Our Readers:

ABCNEWS.com has the latest on what's making headlines in the United States
and around the world:

The new government of Afghanistan will commit as many as 15,000 troops to
aid the United States in its search for Osama bin Laden and members of al
Qaeda, the deputy defense minister said today.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

The fuses for the explosives authorities say were in the shoes worn by
Richard Reid on a trans-Atlantic flight may have been too moist to light,
preventing the man from carrying out a suspected plot to blow up the
plane.  Reid is due in federal court in Boston today for a detention
hearing, where federal prosecutors are expected to ask that he be held
without bail.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/airplane_explosives011228.html

ABCNEWS.com wishes you and your family a happy and healthy new year.  The
year 2001 will forever be remembered for one day: Sept. 11. In a moment,
the world shook and life as Americans had known it changed forever.
ABCNEWS.com takes a look back at that defining day and the other headlines

Rebecca:

Per our conversation, attached please find Clorox's blackline.  You should have Aparna's file including the credit worksheet.  Also, Aparna should have provided you wtih a copy of the ISDA boilerplate (let me know if you need this or anything else).  The credit issues we should focus on include:

(1)  request for cross acceleration [Part 1(b) page 1]
(2)  Cross Default amendment for operational issues [Part 1(b) page 1]
(3)  Credit Event Upon Merger:  use of "materially weaker" definition [Part 1(c) pages 1-2]
(4)  Additional Termination Events:  use of rating downgrade Part 1(i) pages 2-3]
(5)  Delivery of documents [see page 5 comments]
(6)  elimination of "non-reliance" representation [pages 7-8]
(7)  elimination of affiliate setoff [pages 8-9]
(8)  Change to definiton of "Credit Support Amount" [Annex A page 1]
(9)  complete change to Threshold and Independent Amount [Annex A pages 2-3]
(10) "Minimum Transfer Amount" from $0 to $500,000
(11) elimination of the MAC in Par. 13 to the Credit Support Annex [Annex A page 8]
(12)  Enron Corp. guaranty:  elimination of cap [see Enron Corp. guaranty]

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
				Members
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the March 2002 options contract for Copper (HXH2)
and Aluminum (OAH2) is Monday, February 25, 2002.
	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the March 2002 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will cease
at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on February 25, 2002.  All Brokers
and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to
exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Monday, February 25, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Monday's submissions and processing will be
available on Tuesday morning February 26, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.


				CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

		Please note: Trade information reflected on the option
expiration report and transaction listing are trades submitted only. To
inquire whether trades have matched, each CM must review the trade reports
provided by COMEX's On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

Spoke with Phil Levy regarding several issues.  He is immediately emailing FX amendment for the existing master and will simultaneously review the existing ISDA for FX coverage.  The executed amendment will resolve the margining issues ASAP.  ENA will produce a draft Schedule/CSA to begin negotiations for an upgraded master which will include multibranch parties.

 fell 7.36%. Earlier this month the banking sector encountered a sell off w=
hich drove the Nikkei to 18-year lows until the Japanese government announc=
ed it was ready to shore up the troubled sector.  But there is a reason for=
 government apprehension. For instance, the more aggressively the governmen=
t pursues the disposal of non-performing loans (NPL), the more it will incr=
ease unemployment and deflation, thus depressing the economy even further i=
n the short run. Therefore Japan will talk tough but likely take a less agg=
ressive approach towards large institutions by again throwing money at the =
problem. Instead of getting rid of all problem loans, which would bankrupt =
many debtors, a kinder approach - like the bailout of the Daiei retail chai=
n - will likely prevail. Although this is presumably not what Koizumi means=
 by tough reform, given his declining political capital, it is more likely =
he will opt to rescue some key companies to avoid an unwelcome surge in job=
lessness. The end result is a lose/lose situation for JPY, thus the sell of=

pressure as Japan begins to tackle deflation and prevent a financial crisis=
. But how they plan to do this remains unclear. USD/JPY support is seen at =
133.70, 132.65 and 132.35. Resistance is seen at 134.00 and 135.00.  EUR/US=

 86.50, which is the 61.8% retracement of the same move. A break of that le=

Sara and Marie,
Andy Fastow authorized Ben Glisan and Tim Despain in June to withdraw funds from the Enron Corp Account at MSDW.  

MSDW will accept a letter on company letterhead authorizing individuals to withdraw funds.  I can draft up something and have Andy sign it to authorize for Enron Corp.  We will also include Ben and Tim on the document for signatory examples.

As a matter of course, Jill and I have been signing before it goes to Andy.

Can we do this lettter instead of going the Corporate Secretary route to get it done?  It is not good that we currently have sole reliance on Andy being in the office to move funds out of the account.

Please advise.
Sheila

To Our Readers:

Here's the latest on Operation Enduring Freedom and the anthrax cases at
home:

U.S. warplanes attacked Taliban targets along Afghanistan's border with
Tajikistan for the first time in an attempt to take out artillery used to
disrupt a Northern Alliance supply route.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

For the first time since 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court won't be hearing
cases in its historic chambers, after anthrax was discovered at a facility
that sorts the high court's mail.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/us_anthrax.html

Plus,

The FBI has found no traces of anthrax in cars owned by two Sept. 11
hijackers, ABCNEWS has learned.

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 3, 2001.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $3,500)	=
$3,500

To Our Readers:

Here's what's happening today in the war on terrorism and the anthrax
warnings:

Saying the airstrikes have already claimed too many innocent lives, a
group of Afghan exiles hoping to put together a coalition government to
replace the Taliban has appealed to the U.S. to halt its bombing campaign.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

The head of the Postal Service is asking Americans to be careful opening
their mail, while cautioning that the odds of anthrax contamination are
"very, very slim."
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/us_anthrax.html

Plus,

The British and Soviet empires came to an end shortly after fighting in
Afghanistan. Could it be the same for America?
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/afghanistan011024.html

The U.S. is under pressure to wrap up attacks before the start of the
Islamic holy month.

Good Afternoon,
	Credit has an issue with Texex Energy Partners that you should be aware of.  We received an amendment of an LC that reduces the coverage amount to $4mm and extends the expiry date to 1/15/02.  It covers physical MTM which we are in the money approx $2mm.  I assume that we are not performing on these contracts (some go out to 6/02), but Texex has not terminated.  I believe we should call Texex to extend the LC to protect the value of these contracts and if they refuse, we terminate and draw on the current LC.  Do you buy into this strategy?  Please advise at your convenience.

Thanks,

Max Sonnonstine

Houston Astros Baseball season tickets are available sale to employees at their face value.  The seats range in price from $2,490 to $3,237 for the season, and are located in the box and club levels. 

If you're interested in being on the list of potential buyers for Enron's season tickets to the Astro's 2002 home games, please indicate your interest by 4PM, Central Time on Thursday, March 21 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you're interested in purchasing for the full season (no partial season or individual games).  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined, we'll know whether a lottery process will need to take place to fairly allocate the purchase opportunities and will communicate that to respondents.

Please note that the season begins on Friday, March 29 so payment for the tickets will need to be made early next week.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

efore the end of the fiscal year. However, he did not commit to the injecti=
ng of public funds into major commercial banks to help them deal with the m=
assive bad loans on their books, which is considered a prerequisite for Jap=
an to proceede with reforms. The BoJ announced that the nation's monetary b=
ase rose by 27.5% in February from a year earlier, the highest increase sin=
ce August 1974, the sixth consecutive month of double digit growth.   The F=
SA plans to have banks issue stock that would grant the government voting r=
ights on matters related to the appointments and dismissals of board direct=
ors if they will have to receive public funds to avert a financial crisis, =
agency sources said Saturday.Support is seen at 133.0, 132.50- the support =
lying on the trend line extending between the lows January 9 through Februa=
ry 15, followed by 132.20. Upside capped at 134.0, 134.40 and 134.80.  EUR/=
USD is trading around 86.50 underpinned last Friday's release of Eurozone P=
MI that rose to 48.6 in February from the previous revised 46.3, the highes=
t level in the index in 10 months, and suggests that an economic recovery i=
s in the works. However, the single currency's gains were limited by Eurozo=
ne retail sales which slid to -0.6% m/m in December from the previous 1.2%,=
 or to 0.4% y/y from the previous 1.3%, as well as a decline in French cons=
umer confidence to -15 from -12 in a reversal of four straight monthly gain=
s. Thus in the face of mixed signals of economic improvement and restrained=
 by inflationary pressures, the European Central Bank is seen as unlikely t=

 by the 86.0-cent figure, and 85.50. Resistance is seen at 87.0, 87.40 and =
87.80. The ECB and BoE are likely to keep interest rates unchanged at this =
week's policy meeting. The ECB, will probably leave benchmark lending rate =
at 3.25% and the U.K. central bank will maintain its key lending rate at 4%=

  Andrew Will Merlots, Penner-Ash purchases vineyard, Interview with Tony Soter
  
 =============================
 NEWS and ARTICLES
=============================
Tony Soter: Return of an Oregon Native 
 by Cole Danehower, Oregon Wine Report
Tony Soter is one of the most respected winemakers in the business. His consulting clients have included such elite California labels as Araujo Estate, Niebaum-Coppola, Dalla Valle, Moraga Vineyards, Spottswoode, and Viader Vineyard-not to mention his own Pinot noir-focused creation, Etude Winery (recently sold to Beringer Blass). 
  http://www.avalonwine.com/soter-vineyards.htm 
  
 Penner-Ash has purchased vineyard land near Beaux Freres and Patty Green Cellars
 http://www.avalonwine.com/Penner-Ash-Wine-Cellars.htm 
 NW Wine of the Week from Andy Perdue: Powers Parallel 46
 This affordable red blend was ranked No. 1 last week at the annual Pacific Northwest Wine Fair in Toronto. Other wines in the judging included 97 Ridge Montebello, 1998 Hedges Red Mountain Reserve, Gordon Brothers Tradition, and pepper Bridge Cabernet Sauvignon. At $30, the Powers wine was the least expensive of the entrants! Gorgeous bottle, too.

NEW RELEASES

=====================================
Highlights:
 Andrew Will 2000 Merlots- Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills, Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval, Sheridan
 Chris Camarda's delicious and hard to get Merlots- 2000 vintage is  made from "his best fruit ever".
Robert Parker says of Chris's wines: "Andrew Will's wines have virtually perfect tannins. They are present but buffered by the loads of dominating sweet fruit. Furthermore, what is amazing about Chris Camarda's wines is that they are concentrated yet grateful. Camarda's (wines) blend power with elegance, concentration with finesse, and supersweet fruit with definition. Chris Camarda is a brilliant winemaker."

Since TXU terminated (effective 2/26/02) should we still send the demand letter?  I'm thinking not.  The goal of moving the contract to terminated status has been accomplished and I doubt they will pay anything now considering we have agreed to begin settlement discussion.  Furthermore, I don't want to irritate the situation with them.

What do you think?

We sincerely regret to inform you of a tragedy that occurred earlier today.  Cliff Baxter passed away this morning.  Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes.

Notice No. 02-25
January 22, 2002



TO:		All COMEX Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Clearing Members
All COMEX Floor Traders
All COMEX Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing Members
_______________________________________________________________________
The expiration date for the February 2002 options contract for Copper (HXG2)
and Aluminum (OAG2) is Monday, January 28, 2002.

	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry ("OLTE") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.



	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the February 2002 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will
cease at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on January 28, 2002.  All
Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions
to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Monday, January 28, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special "OLTE" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Monday's submissions and processing will be
available on Tuesday morning January 29, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.


CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION ("OPC") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM ("E/A") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member ("CM") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM ("OPRR") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("H/C") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
("Trade Audits").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM ("Ex-Pit") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry ("OLTE") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

indicated that price pressures are easing and will therefore give the ECB f=

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

Please be reminded that Wednesday, October 31, 2001, is the First Notice
Day, for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of
November 2001 (the new spot month).

On Tuesday, October 30, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers
and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry
("OLTE") system trained representative available until such time as the
Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

Sara- I am sorry to hear Frank has left.. have you spoken to him, is he OK? How are you doing?

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,
Caroline
