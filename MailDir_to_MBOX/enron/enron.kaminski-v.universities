As a followup, John Gillespie has expressed interest in participating on the 
panel mentioned below.  To whom should I refer John or should somebody 
contact him?  I just wanted to know what to tell John.

Thanks,
Martin

I did not find anybody in EBS who seems to know or be involved in any 
e-procurement issues.  In Enron Corp, however, there is an initiative called 
iBuyIt.  This is a system that Corp is deploying for e-procurement through 
Corp and ENA, and will get to EBS sometime late this year.

John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative.  Perhaps he is the 
appropriate contact.  I left a voice mail with him, but have not yet received 
a response.

Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

Happy New Year. I hope the first few weeks of this year will see the

I am sending you the last version of the paper I have received with a few

Vince. This is good but I also need a title. It would be good if you can as
part of the talk present an example of a technical problem addressed by your
group describing the problem and the general methodology employed or
developed. You can also start with an introduction about your organization
and the program.

Dear Ms. Patrick,
 
Anne Stamer asked me to contact you  regarding Enron providing a judge for 
Phase III of the Business Plan  Competition.  Phase III judges are generally 
Partner-level individuals at  venture capital firms, Managing Directors from 
investment banks, or other  senior individuals who have extensive experience 
assessing and working with  early stage ventures.  A Phase III judge will 
receive five business plans,  with the entire judging process requiring 4-5 
hours during the weeks of April 2  and April 9.  I am attaching a document 
that describes the competition and  judging procedures for Phase III in more 
detail.  We are looking to  finalize the list of Phase III judges by March 
23, so if you could please  forward either Anne or I the name of the 
appropriate individual, we can contact  them directly with more details.  
Please let me know if you have further  questions and we appreciate your 
support of the Competition.
 
Sincerely,
 
Andrew  Gaffney

Mark,

Two points. 

1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power 
Play", is on a
tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a 
meeting last Sunday 
at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to
the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40 
people attended.

2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to 
write jointly an
academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an 
article on EBS.
I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company 
Reinventing Itself.

I made a few points to John:

a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident.
It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching
strategy developed by the management.

b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up 
with a term
"proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."

c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality
of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee
empowerment.

d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and 
accomplishemnts.

The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate 
strategy
and would help greatly our recruiting efforts. 


Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key 
players. 
Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.

Vince

Frank,

We shall have about 30 people, highly technical (Ph.D.,  M.S. level).
A presentation of 45 minutes would be optimal, assuming you may arrive 
around 11:45 - 12:00.


We shall get the projector for you.

Please, keep all the receipts for refund.

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in responding to you.
I am currently in London, flying back to Houston tomorrow.

The problem is not  with the lawyers. We worked on our presentation
materials together with a professor from another university
and we agreed to use these materials only internally.

We have to honor our commitment to him. I am sure
that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had
made a similar commitment to you.

 What do I need to do to move this thing forward?
I suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers.  They only know
how to stop things, but in a way they play a role in global society.  If it
were not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never
have a chance.

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

I still have not heard from your lawyer.  I would like to see whar
materials you are using and assess how we could work on the topic of
real
options with Enron

Thanks
Vince. This is good but I also need a title. It would be good if you can as
part of the talk present an example of a technical problem addressed by your
group describing the problem and the general methodology employed or
developed. You can also start with an introduction about your organization
and the program.

stay longer to interview him.  Will let you know as soon as we do.

are faxing Shmuel Oren's resume to Kristin and checking to see if  there is 
any time on the closed schedule, or if the interviewers will stay longer to 
include him.  I will let you know today if we can make it work.

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in

His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a

Vince and Jeff,

Who should we list as a judge?  I could list myself to act as the point of 
contact and I'll also give my comments on the plans, but I think Enron's  
"judge" should be someone in the capacity of evaluating Enron's early stage 
ventures.

Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Dear Ms. Patrick,
?
Anne Stamer asked me to contact you  regarding?Enron providing a judge for 
Phase III of the Business Plan  Competition.? Phase III judges are generally 
Partner-level individuals at  venture capital firms,?Managing Directors from 
investment banks, or other  senior individuals?who have extensive experience 
assessing and working with  early stage ventures.? A Phase III judge will 
receive five business plans,  with the entire judging process requiring 4-5 
hours during the weeks of April 2  and April 9.? I am attaching a document 
that describes the competition and  judging procedures for Phase III in more 
detail.? We are looking to  finalize the list of Phase III judges by March 
23, so if you could please  forward either Anne or I the name of the 
appropriate individual, we can contact  them directly with more details.? 
Please let me know if you have further  questions and we appreciate your 
support of the Competition.

Sincerely,

Hi Vince and Happy New Year
Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to
balance my commitments here.

Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members
while walking the fine line between cooperation and competition. We are
definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the
members but rather working on more generic areas that later individual
members could see way to convert to proprietary tools. The work that Shijie
Deng and Rajnish Kamat have been doing with me are good examples.

As to my trip, thanks for the invitation but I already committed myself to
get back Friday night so I will save my visit for another time.

I will tell my son about the spring interviews at Cornell. Hopefully this
time he will not miss it.

Regards, Shmuel

Hi John and Vince!

John, hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth 
below.

I'm in NY now and won't  return until Thursday morning.  Perhaps it would be 
easiest for John to come to the video conference on Thursday (if he's in 
Houston) or via telephone if he's travelling??

Whatever  you both think is best..please let me know!

My assistant, Melinda McCarty, is setting up the call location at the Enron 
Building, as well as the dial-in number with Donna Piazze at Wharton.

Melinda, please include John in the distribution of the video conference 
location.

Thanks!

Christie,

As we talked last Thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to 
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for NewPower 
including value-added products and services for the future.  Before we talk 
again on Thursday, we would like to speak with John Henderson again to see if 
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address.

We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a 
phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next 
video teleconference.  We are available the next two days at 1pm and 4pm 
Houston time.

We understand that John is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help you 
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his 
expectations.

Thanks,

Enron Team 3 (Retail)

Francois and Kent,

Hope this proposal reaches you in time for consideration for the upcoming
FMA-European meeting.  I normally don't like to commit myself to a proposal
but in this case I'm very comfortable doing so in light of the status of
the project.  As you will see this "clinical" paper is a study of strategy
formulation in a very innovative company that uses financial derivatives in
conjunction with real asset investments.  The firm, Enron, has been the
most innovative company in America for more than five years now and has
expanded its strategy abroad.  We have the unique opportunity to document
the firm's strategy from the inside with my co-authors being members of the
corporate research staff that manage the pricing of the energy derivatives
in which the firm makes a market, as well as provide the analysis upon
which firm risk positions are managed.  Although, specific Enron projects
have been documented and published, noone has captured the story of the
company visionaries that formulated and executed the firm's business
strategy.  Of course, what makes the story of particular interest to
finance scholars is the fact that the strategy hinges in very important
ways on financial innovations.  This is going to be a very informative and
fun story to tell and I hope to bring along my colleagues from Enron to
Paris for the meeting.

Thanks for asking me to join the program advisory board and I look forward
to your comments on the attached proposal.

Sincerely yours,


John

Hi!

Attached please find the Itinerary for the Harvard---NYU trip; please 
disregard any parts of the trip that don't apply to you.

If I have not already done so, I'll try this morning to get you a copy of the 
Enron OnLine case being taught at Harvard tomorrow (Thursday).  Otherwise, 
I'll give it to you on the plane--it's fewer than 15 pages, so it's a quick 
read.

Please call me if you have any questions (3-6117).  Otherwise, I'll see you 
at the corporate hangar at 6pm. 

(For anyone unfamiliar with the location of the corporate hangar, I believe 
you can get a map/address/directions from the Enron Aviation department.)

Thanks!

--Christie.

Hi Michele

I am writing to confirm that Enron will be participating in the
Sales/Trading
panel.

I have some great news. We have decided to give Enron the Sponsorship
spot for the Sales and Trading panel.


Key benifits of being a Panel Sponsor

- A big Enron Banner can be displayed indicating that you are the official
sponsor of the entire Sales/Trading panel
- Mention in the program guide and all other conference material
- In addition to the panelist spot on the Sales/Trading panel, Enron
gets to open the panel session with a 15-20min presentation on general
trends in the sales and trading industry, an excellent opportunity
for a senior person from Enron to address the audience.

Also for folks from Enron coming to the conference we have hotel rooms
blocked at a discount price at the Park Hyatt.

I will be getting you a lot of the details with regards to logistics for the
panel and Enrons participation in the conference in the coming weeks..

Once again, I would like to thank you for the sponsorship and presence at
The finance conference.

Looking forward to it..

Regards
Suresh Balasubramanian

This Friday during your visit I will be in California for a cousin's
wedding.  I am having miserable luck connecting with you.  However, while
you are at GSIA, Chester Spatt (one of my co-authors) would like to meet
with you if your schedule permits.  I am copying him on this email so you
can contact him directly. Please also let Peirre (who is also copied on this

See you next time I hope,

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

Aisha Jamal

John,

It does not sound silly to me.  I don't get that many opportunities to sit 
down
with those guys in a relaxed atmosphere and chat.

I shall read the notes and get back to you. I have just come back from
 Philadelphia and have to catch up  with a few things.

Subject: Good morning


Vince,

i know that you are in Philadelphia today but wanted to ship you my "first
pass notes" before I leave town in the morning.  Please edit/add to or
delete anything you think is appropriate.  My objective in the notes is
just to get things down on paper before too much time has passed.  When I
place something in  quotes this indicates a direct quote.

I'll give you a call next week when I get back to town.  Thanks again for a
truly memorable experience.  I plan to frame Jeff's Enron model.  It may
sound silly to you guys but we academics really appreciate opportunities
like the one I got on Monday.  What a truly spectacular day.

Take care,

John

p.s. Andy gave me his note care describing the demand for a peaking plant
but I wasn't able to get him to sign it.  I hope I did not offend him by
asking for his signature on that silly graph.  After I left his office it
occured to me that he might think I was making light of him.  Please
explain to him that I was not and will treasure his simple model as
capturing the essence of optionality in a real asset.

Dear Vince,

      The following message is from co-PI, Prof. Baichun Xiao in Long
Island University.
In this message, he told me how Enron would be registered. To my best
knowledge,
IBM, Lucent and other big companies have registered in NSF for long.
Your kindly understanding is acknowledged very much.

     Good weekend,

Dear Youyi:

The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration.

FastLane User Support: 1-800-673-6188.
FastLane Availability (Recording): 1-800-437-7408.

After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide
the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to
nsf.
NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
(called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after Oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.


Name
Highest Degree
Year Conferred
Present Institution
Department
Street Address
City
State
Zip Code
Social Security Number (SSN)
Email Address
Business Phone Number
Business Fax Number


For more information, you may go to

Hi Anne!

I'll be at Wharton on Tuesday the 20th--perhaps we can get  together to 
discuss this sometime later in the afternoon.  What does your schedule look 
like?

Thanks!

Dear Christie:

Thank you for your voice mail. Things  are moving along nicely with the 
competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some 
statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase 
I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let 
me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.

* We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we 
could get your logo.

* Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair 
(VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business 
plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon

*  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The 
VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture 
capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in 
Philadelphia on April 30th.

* At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot 
table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you 
wish to use the exhibit space.

*  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one 
mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day 
commitment.

*  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.  
Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?

I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,


Anne Stamer

 Good afternoon.  Packing emails--its just my style :)

 Currently, it is my understanding that we would like to interview the Comp. 
Fin. students during the same period that we interview the MBA's.   
Tentatively speaking, one schedule should be sufficient.  I will attempt to 
produce an official job description shortly.
 Kristen is out of town for the remainder of the week, so her response to any 
inquiries may be delayed.  Her contact info:  kristin.gandy@enron.com  713 
345 3214
 Regarding the satellite program, Vince is interested in the ECommerce 
program.  We think that it would be easier to keep the program full as 
compared to the Comp. Fin. program.  

 It was a pleasure to be back in Pittsburgh and I enjoyed meeting all the 
students from this year's Comp. Fin. class.  I look forward to seeing you in 
a few weeks.

We are excited that you want to interview the Comp finance students.

Do you want to do it in Dec. or before?  Let me know what best suits you.
Since there are only 16 individuals in the Pittsburgh area... we should be
able to accomodate you...Would you want one or two schedules..?

  What is the formal protocol in such matters?

If you can send me an e-mail address for Kristen, I can get this strating
asap.

What program is Vince interested in having a satellite program?  When he was
here he seemed less intererted in Comp finance and more interested in
E-commerce.

I sent a note to Michael Shamos and Tridas discussing this.

Let me know which program and I will see if we can work anything out?

Vince,

one of my colleagues here at Baylor is writing a book about "the business
of heaven" in which he interviews prominent business leaders.  Bob Darden
is his name and he's a former journalist and nice guy.  He would like to
contact Ken Lay about being one of his interviews.  Do you think this is
possible?  If so, could you give me an address/phone numbers that Bob might
use to contact Ken's secretary about setting up an interview?

If this is in any way "not ok" please just say so.

See ya,

John

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.


Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Vince,

This is my latest effort and I would appreciate your thoughts.  I know that
we haven't written together before so let me assure me that you will not
hurt my feelings by "slashing away" with a red pen.  I think that I have
put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still
pretty crude.  Help me "refine" the work to create something we can both be
very proud of.

By the way, I know you are extremely busy right now so don't feel pressured
to spend lots of time here.  Any guidance you can offer will be
appreciated.  I don't know what the editor's time schedule is but he asked
me to send him a draft on Monday.  You and I will still be able to edit the
manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too.  I'll let you know
as soon as I have a final deadline.

Your friend,

John

p.s. Hope life is a bit calmer for you.  By the way, I'm reading an
interesting book entitled "The Four Agreements" by Miguel Ruiz that
documents the Toltec philosophy of life in the context of the dreams of
reality that we all create.  You might enjoy it.

Can I call you Tuesday morning about our writing project?  I have to be in
Austin for a dental appointment on Monday at noon and that will probably
wipe out the day.  Give me a time and number where I can reach you.

Vince,

I'm glad you liked it.  My next "Enron" task is to try and develop a better
understanding of the way you describe the use of BTU swaps to create a
synthethic multi-fuel plant.  I understand the basic concept but want to
learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a
company's decision to build a single vs multi-fuel generator.  Do you have
some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?

See ya in April (we're going to learn to "rope" calves this year).

Your friend,

John

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk 
September 15,  2000
Raymond Cote
Vice President, FinRad Inc.  NBC

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc.,  a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that  
combine advisory and systems development services to &corporations and  
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to  credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or  academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as  a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure. The  presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity  risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk management.

Vince,

Just an update for you and a question.  First, I have talked to Christie
and corresponded via e-mail.  We don't have dates to talk to Lay, Skilling
and Fastow as yet but Christie is working on it.  I will prompt her again
next week.

The second item of business is a question.  I want to see if we can move
our meeting in Spring (Business education and the new economy workshop)
back a week to Friday February 23rd.  One of the attendees has a conference
he wants to attend on March 2nd.  Let me know asap if the 23rd works for
you.  I have committments from a number of folks for the workshop and I
think it will be great fun and a wonderful learning experience for us all.

Vince,

Would you mind making a few luncheon comments to the Texas Finance Festival
group at our sat luncheon?  I struck out with Andy and Sheridan thought
that you could relate very well to the group.  How about it?

Sure.  I'd love to share my experiences.  Have him give me a call.

By the way, the chapter you sent has been VERY helpful to me in coming to
understand Enron's early history.  "I'm getting it" even if slowly.

Hello guys,

I'm "bugging you" for your completed questionnaire and for a one-page
bio/statement on your thoughts on "Business Edu and the New Economy".  If
my records are incorrect please re-ship your responses to me.  I want to
put everything together next week so that I can ship it back to everyone.

the questionnaire is attached as well as copies of the bio pages for
Michael Froehls and myself (two somewhat different approaches).  The idea
of the latter is just to introduce yourself to the other panelists and give
them some background on how you are approaching the issues we will discuss.
 We will also provide copies to the attendees and use this material for our
personal introductions at the opening of the panel discussions.

Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.

John

Hello from Texas,

We are trying to set up our meeting date for the 2001 conference and have run 
into a snag.  We cannot get our San Antonio hotel on the first weekend in 
April (as last year).  However, we can get the hotel and make all our "fun" 
arrangements for the second weekend in April.  However, this is Easter 
weekend.  The good news is that the room rates are substantially lower 
because it's a holiday.  However, we are concerned that holding the meeting 
on this particular Friday-Saturday will interfere with family plans such that 
some or many of you may not be able to attend.  

My related question to you is this:

Does holding the meeting on the second weekend in April (Easter weekend) pose 
a problem for you?  Please give us your thoughts ASAP even if you think you 
may not be able to attend this year's conference.  We need your opinion to 
guide our decision.

Thanks and I hope to see you all again next April (sometime)!

John 

p.s.  We are very fortunate to have Enron return as our corporate sponsor 
again this year.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for the natural gas information. The electricity price
is also definitely of great help if it can be available.

Could you kindly please let me know the contact information for FT or
Megawatt Daily? I will contact them asap to get their permission for the
access of the price data.

Thank you very much and have a great day!

Mulong

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk 
September 15, 2000
Raymond Cote
Vice  President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that 
combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and 
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Congratulations!!!

You have been nominated to join the Cal Berkeley Campus Team.  Beginning this 
Fall, Enron will head to the University of California at Berkeley for the 
first time!   In addition to traditional Analyst recruiting focusing on 
Finance, Economics, and Business majors, the Analyst program will add a new 
addition to it's rotational program - The Global Technology Track.   The 
Global Technology Track will provide a pipeline for MIS, Computer Science and 
Engineering majors to join Enron and rotate within Enron Net Works and EBS 
technology functions.  Therefore, we would like to create a recruiting team 
that represents all aspects of Enron including both IT and Business "swat 
teams" to help attack campus during career fairs, presentations, dinners, and 
other events searching for the ideal candidate.  

In the next week you will receive an invitation to the Cal Berkeley Planning 
Session and Kickoff.  At that time we will review strategies, profiles, and 
events to ensure that Enron is able to attract the top candidates!  Please 
make every effort to attend.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 3-3589.

Thanks,

Ashley Baxter
Global Technology Track
Recruiter

Subject: RE: Houston Trip


Dear Vince / Christie,

Thanks for coming to Philadelphia to present an overview of the projects. We 
enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with 
Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as 
well.

We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and 
additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January 
19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We 
plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are 
considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either
(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to 
serve retail customers, OR
(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas 
for further investments.

However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy 
Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to 
suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; 
so please let us know.

We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but 
here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:

Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is 
in the annual report?
What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?
Who are the customers and how are they acquired?
What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron?
What are the international expansion plans and capabilities?
Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?

If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, 
will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?

After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to 
schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly 
involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in 
the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to 
call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

Regards,
Retail Energy Services Tiger Team

Hi John and Vince!

John, hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth 
below.

I'm in NY now and won't  return until Thursday morning.  Perhaps it would be 
easiest for John to come to the video conference on Thursday (if he's in 
Houston) or via telephone if he's travelling??

Whatever  you both think is best..please let me know!

My assistant, Melinda McCarty, is setting up the call location at the Enron 
Building, as well as the dial-in number with Donna Piazze at Wharton.

Melinda, please include John in the distribution of the video conference 
location.

Thanks!

Christie,

As we talked last Thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to 
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for NewPower 
including value-added products and services for the future.  Before we talk 
again on Thursday, we would like to speak with John Henderson again to see if 
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address.

We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a 
phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next 
video teleconference.  We are available the next two days at 1pm and 4pm 
Houston time.

We understand that John is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help you 
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his 
expectations.

Thanks,

Enron Team 3 (Retail)

Hi Carrie,

It was great meeting with you and Dean Whitaker again last Friday, as well as 
Mr. Westbrook.
 As we discussed,  I have submitted the Action Learning Program materials to 
Vince Kaminski, our managing director of Risk analysis and Corporate 
Research.  I'll be following up with him, and his recommendations for project 
proposals next week.
  Also, I've discussed with our University Affairs team setting up the 
faculty tours--we're ready when you are!!  The sooner the better--I'd love to 
get these in pretty immediately, and in any event, before the reception at 
the end of the month.  I"ll have Cindy Derecskey in my group eMail you--she 
is prepared to set these tours up.  

I look forward to continuing to develop the multiple potential dynamics of 
the Enron-Rice relationship!

Thanks!

--Christie.

ps:  Thanks so much for the Crystal Rice Owl--my participation as a judge in 
the Rice Invitational Case Competition was my pleasure indeed!

Christie,

I enjoyed visiting with you last week at the Jones School.  Thanks for
taking time to come see us.  I wanted to follow up with you regarding the
Action Learning Project program and Enron tour.  We hope to have Enron as
part of the program in 2001.  Please let me know how I can help make this
happen.  I look for the program to be full before the deadline of December
1st.  Also, I am happy to help organize a group to tour Enron.  If you were
to participate in the ALP program, January/February might be a good time to
put something together with key faculty and the ALP team.  Let me know your
thoughts.

Again, many thanks for your continued support of the Jones School.  I look
forward to hearing from you soon.

Carrie

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk 
September 15, 2000
Raymond Cote
Vice  President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that 
combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and 
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Vince,

I got the zipped version fine.  Thanks  The only outstanding items relate
to the complete references for your papers (the book publisher and dates).
I spoke with Shirley this morning and she is tracing this down for me.

I re-read the Gas Market paper segment on the take-or-pay contracts and
corrected my "oversight".  By the end of the day I hope to have all the
corrections that you gave me incorporated in the manuscript.  We will make
them on the galley pages of the article when it arrives.

thanks again for all your help.

John

p.s. I also spoke with Mary Joyce (she returned my earlier call a week ago
when I was trying to ask Cindy something).  All is well.  At 10:15 AM

Vince,

Two things.  Do you have any comments on the interview document?  Second, I
want to submit a proposal to the European Financial Management Association
meetings for next May based on our paper.  The meeting is in May and is
held in Paris.  Hope you can come (assuming the program committee likes our
proposal--I won the best paper award at last year's meeting so maybe we can
do it again).

Looking forward to hearing form you so I can get Bob's response to the
questions.

John

I'd be interested to see who else is sponsoring the conference and who the 
other panelists would be.  Since it is a first year conference, the success 
of it is highly dependent on the people who are pulling it together.  Since 
the deadline on the sponsorship form is Sept. 8, they should be able to give 
us an indication of other participants.  Do you want me to call Suresh to 
find out - he's been emailing me every other day about how interested he is 
in working for EBS anyway.  The timing of it is good - the week after 
everyone comes for Super Saturday.  I'd also be interested in what Tom says. 
I'd only do a Gold sponsorship - I don't think we need or want to be on more 
than 1 panel - either the corporate finance or sales and trading.

It's not necessarily an either/or decision.  Michelle, do you think this is a 
good program?  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton, and ask him what 
he thinks about the importance of our participation in this?

Hi Kristin

I am following up on our conversation earlier with respect to Enron
participating in the Whartons Finance conference and the evening
reception known as Bullish on Finance.

I think this forum will be a great opprotunity for Enron to reach
the students interested in finance and it also provides a great platform
to talk about Enrons unique position in the global financial
community.

Please do consider the option of sponsoring a panel at the Gold level.
It provides a great value and essentially a full panel "ownership" to
talk about Enrons acitivities.

I would like to touch base with you early next week to hear you thoughts
and feedback on these proposals.

Looking forward to a great conference participation.

Kind Regards
Suresh

Hi Anne!

I'll be at Wharton on Tuesday the 20th--perhaps we can get  together to 
discuss this sometime later in the afternoon.  What does your schedule look 
like?

Thanks!

Dear Christie:

Thank you for your voice mail. Things  are moving along nicely with the 
competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some 
statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase 
I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let 
me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.

* We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we 
could get your logo.

* Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair 
(VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business 
plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon

*  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The 
VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture 
capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in 
Philadelphia on April 30th.

* At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot 
table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you 
wish to use the exhibit space.

*  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one 
mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day 
commitment.

*  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.  
Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?

I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,


Anne Stamer

Hi Vince!

Yes, meeting for dinner Tuesday night is great!

I'll be coming in on Tuesday from D.C.  and I'll be taking the Train to New 
York on Wednesday morning.

See you and Ken Tuesday at 5:30 at the Inn at Penn Lobby.

Hope you both have a great weekend!!

Thanks!

Hi Vince!

Thanks for the information below!

I spoke with Tom Piazze today.  I'll be meeting with him at 3:30 on the 20th 
to discuss the WeBI contract.  I'll also be meeting with Wharton's broadband 
(technical people) before our meeting with the students.  Further, I hope to 
meet with the people in charge of the Business Plan Competition.

Tom  suggested you might want to call Howard Kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly 
stop in to see him while we are at Wharton.

I'll be getting to Wharton sometime Tuesday; I'll try to get a reservation at 
the Inn at Penn.  I'll then be leaving early Wednesday morning by train to 
New York.

Shall we meet in tha Lobby at the Inn at Penn before going to meet the 
students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6pm-ish)--say, 5:30?  
Please let me know!

Also, we still need to give Wharton an answer as to whether we're interested 
in another $50,000 investment in eFellows.

Thanks Vince!

Have a great wekend!

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at IEOR very much.
I wonder if you could point me to some information
resource on Enron's bandwidth market.

I am a Ph.D student at IEOR. I work with Professor
Oren and Professor Varaiya from EECS department on
the topic of pricing the Internet. In particular, I am designing
pricing mechanism in the framework of the DiffServ
architecture which is the latest proposal made by
IETF to provide scalable service differentiation.
I would very much like to get in touch with people
in Enron working on the similar topics.

Thank you very much.

Dear Vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you about the
date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If you can
schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient
lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their financial
engineering students.
Shmuel.

Vasant,

So Sorry for the name mix up...it is YOU , not "Vance", another guy on my PR  
team, who is to be included in this...so sorry..I'd just gotten off the phone 
with "Vance" before I wrote this.   I'm writing this from 
"vacation-day-at-my-house"..which I can tell, the "vacation" part,  I should 
start taking literally!

Happy Holidays!

Clayton DeDiocinto.

Note: Heather and  Jack have requested to stay in Houston until Sunday 
(expenses other than air fare, beyonfd Friday at Enron will be individually 
borne).

Donna,

Would you please review this list, add the individual names of "team # 1), 
add any additional faculty, T.A.'s etc, that will be attending, and returnm 
this list to me and my assistant, "Melinda McCarty" who will begin the 
arrangements.  Also, if others would prefer Sunday returns to Phily, on the 
same terms offered Heather  and Jack, please so indicate NO LATER THAN 
Tuesday, Dec. 20.  Please inform Donna, who will then prepare and forward to 
me and my assistant  Melinda(e-mail address above) one complete, confirmed 
list of attendees.  The plan will be to leave Phily on Thurs afternoon, 
arrive late aft Thursday, Dinner at Churrasco's  South America Restaurant 
Thursday evening with me, Vince, Vance, Jeff Shankman, and possibly a few 
others from Enron.

Hotel Thursday evening and ground transportation through return to airport 
will be arranged by Enron.

Friday will be reserved for an Enron tour, and individual meetings the teams 
would like to set up with members from variuous business units 

Return will be scheduled for early Fri evening, except for those electing to 
stay through Sunday.  Again, except for return to airport and airfare, 
expenses beyond Friday afternoon will be borne by each respective student 
(though we encourage you to stay and look around this great city of Houston!).

Thanks Donna, for your immediate assistance with this--Vinve, Vance, Jeff and 
I are excited about the trip!!

Regards!

--Christie.

Hey Vince,

Since I saw you last, the "Real World Option Princing" paper has taken on
some more interesting results.  Tim Crack and I would certainly like your
comments on the previous version and current version because we feel there
are still more areas to explore, such as, Value at Risk.  Here is where you
can download the paper:

I hope this e-mail finds you in air conditioned room away from the heat.

with his schedule - up to December 6th - or the following couple of weeks 
after Dec. 8th.  Do these dates work for you as well?  If so, I will proceed 
in booking one hour sessions with the following Enron management:

Ken Lay
Jeff Skilling
Andy Fastow

If these dates do not work for you let me know when you are available and I 
will try to coordinate with John, Jeff, Ken and Andy.  Also, I will send an 
introductory email to John.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you,

Dear Mr. Kaminski

Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care who
they infect near the end of the semester, they just want to get done!

Here is my available schedule for next year.  I am now overloaded next week
with tasks to complete the semester.  I do hope that we can reschedule
during the first quarter next year.

I would note that my schedule is most free for Thursday or Friday.  I could
fly out late Wednesday night.

Cordially,

Gerry

Great.  Why don't you plan on getting here by 3:00 p.m. (or sooner).  We'll
do a little seminar at 4 for the faculty (perhaps outlining your thoughts
on the paper we are preparing).  We'll do the class 6-7:30 or so (I'll get
you to your hotel for I teach until 10 pm).  Then we'll put in time Tue
working on the paper.

I agree.  If you think that this candidate would be good for your group 
specifically - I would invite him in directly.

Hope all is well.

This is one resume I got today. I think that it makes sense to invite him
for an interview directly with my group. He does not qualify as an analyst

What do you think?

Jim,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling 
extensively  
and was overwhelmed with many different projects.

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, I 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two 
days in a row).

I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student, 
Shane Green, has joined us
for 12 month and is doing exceptionally well.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Dear Professor Shreve,

Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation at
Carnegie Mellon. I am discussing with Pierre Ste-Marie possible dates and it
seems at this point that November the 3rd would be the most convenient day.

November the 10th is an alternative date, but I need a few more days to make
a commitment.


Look forward to meeting you.

John,

The phone number for Ken Lay is (713) 853-6773.
My recommendation is to call Mark Palmer first and discuss the book
with him. His recommendation will open the door. I shall mention this to him
as well. Mark's phone number is   (713) 853-4738.

Vince,

one of my colleagues here at Baylor is writing a book about "the business
of heaven" in which he interviews prominent business leaders.  Bob Darden
is his name and he's a former journalist and nice guy.  He would like to
contact Ken Lay about being one of his interviews.  Do you think this is
possible?  If so, could you give me an address/phone numbers that Bob might
use to contact Ken's secretary about setting up an interview?

If this is in any way "not ok" please just say so.

See ya,

John

Dear Vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you about the
date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If you can
schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient
lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their financial
engineering students.
Shmuel.

Vince,

I am writing to ask for your help with some research I am doing with John
Lehoczky and a PhD student.  We trying to apply recent advances in Monte
Carlo for American options to value Swing and other options with multiple
early exercise decisions that are important in energy markets.  I know in
general that early exercise shows up in a wide range of energy contracts,
both real as welll as financial.  Would it be possible for you, either via
email or on the phone, to give us some examples of typical terms for such
instruments?  We would like our examples to look realistic.  We also want to
make sure we are focusing on the right sorts of optionality.

Thanks in advance,
Duane

Vince,

Attached is a copy of the typeset version that I will be reading today.  I
will check to make sure that all the changes you gave me this weekend are
incorporated.  I will also be writing a 200 word summary for the paper
today and will pass that by you as well.

Have a great day.

john

p.s. I'll call Shirley about the revenue question I sent you yesterday.

Hey Vince,

Since I saw you last, the "Real World Option Princing" paper has taken on
some more interesting results.  Tim Crack and I would certainly like your
comments on the previous version and current version because we feel there
are still more areas to explore, such as, Value at Risk.  Here is where you
can download the paper:

http://www.bus.indiana.edu/tcrack/gopop.pdf

I hope this e-mail finds you in air conditioned room away from the heat.

Dear Jeff,

Our tiger team very much enjoyed your presentation about Enron Global Markets 
on Friday.  Given that we have latitude in our project scope, our team would 
like to assist Enron in evaluating a new market opportunity.  You mentioned 
several markets that Enron is considering in 2001, including transportation, 
cement, coffee, cocoa, sugar, etc.  We believe that a project of this sort 
will give us the opportunity to really learn how Enron creates value, what 
its business model and core competencies are, and how they can be translated 
to a new market.  Furthermore, we can get an in-depth understanding of an 
industry.  We believe our project will complement any analysis that your 
business group is currently undertaking.  Please propose the top three new 
markets that you would like us to evaluate for Enron.

Upon receipt of your proposal, perhaps we could set up a conference call to 
discuss your thoughts and to make a final selection.

Your expeditious response is appreciated.

Regards,

Josh Leventhal

Hello Vince and John,

I wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus.  We can 
tweak these however we feel appropriate to match Cal Berkeley on Monday.  I 
believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students (based on interest 
shown at the Career Fair).  These tend to be fairly informal.  I was thinking 
that we could present in this order:

Vince  Gives the Enron overview presentation  (30 minutes)
John  Gives the Global Technology specific presentation (20 minutes)
 Ashley  Goes over recruiting information at the end (10 minutes)

Please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you 
feel comfortable with the layout and content.  I am meeting with John today 
at 1:30 - Vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that 
would be great.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. 3-3589
Thanks,
Ashley
Vince, here is a copy of the current Enron overview presentation.  There are 
also speaker notes that go into great detail.  

John, here is a copy of the current technology presentation for Carnegie 
Mellon.  The only changes will be to the recruiting dates at the end.  There 
are also speaker notes that go into greater detail.  --->

Christie,

Thanks for taking initiative on the trip so quickly. Let's meet with Jeff 
Shankman
to discuss the agenda. I shall try to organize a meeting next week after PRCs
are over.

I agree with your assessment of the group. I was greatly impressed with the 
caliber of the students.

Hi evryone!

Vince, Vasant and I are very excited about the Tiger Project!  We all 
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet with such an incredibly 
interesting, enthusiastic and intelligent group.  Thank you for your time!

For those interested in the Houston trip on January 18-19th, please let me 
know by the 15th of December so that I can get the best deal on air fare 
(one-month in advance).

Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze for 
your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as Jeff 
is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and one of the 
most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders.  

Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can do for 
any of you.

Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron!

--Christie.

Li,

Globally there are probably over 80 "competitors" to EOL.  None of these 
competitors have a meaningful market share.  Some of the names that jump to 
mind are the following, but it should be easy to find others by surfing the 
web.  Good luck.

Shmuel,

I hope you remember me. I visited you together with Aram Sogomonian, a
good friend of mine, a few years ago. I am currently responsible, among
other things, for recruiting graduates with finance and/or technical
backgrounds at the University of Berkeley. I would be glad to give you a
call and talk more about the details of our program. My colleague,
AshleyBaxter, from the Analyst/Associate Program at Enron would join me
as well.

I am sending you a copy of the brochure about the Analyst / Associate
Program.

WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE E-COMMERCE SHAKEOUT
Thursday,  October 19, 2000 (dinner)
Friday, October 20 (conference)

CONFERENCE THEMES & OBJECTIVES

E-Commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable
shakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new
industry.  This impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of
industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the
E-Commerce shakeout, and what it takes to be a "winner" when the shakeout
hits, full-force.

Shakeouts are spawned in the boom-and-bust environment of hot emerging
markets.  An unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the
contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology.  As competition
intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of
ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players.

Few eCommerce markets--whether e-tailing online exchanges or others---will
be exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts.  This conference will
combine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts, with the
latest thinking about the unique features of E-commerce, to identify
successful strategies for surviving a shakeout.

Questions to be addressed include:

- Are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets
applicable to eCommerce?  What are the early warning signs of an impending
shakeout?

- Which eCommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout?  Will there
be single or multiple winners?

- Which companies are likely to survive?  What strategies will the winners 
use?

There is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most
contribute to prospects for survival.  How important are first mover
advantages and building brand equity?  What do incumbents have to do to
prevail?  Which business models are most robust?  How important is the
ability to manage strategic partnerships?

These issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active
dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry, academia and
Wall Street.

DIRECTIONS TO THE EVENT & ACCOMMODATIONS:

The dinner will be held at The Inn At Penn which is located at 3600 Sansom
Street.   There is also an entrance on Walnut Street between 36h and 37th.

The conference will be held in Steinberg-Dietrich Hall which is located on
Locust Walk on the Wharton campus in Philadelphia.  From the airport or
train station take a taxi to the intersection of 37th Street and Walnut,
walk LEFT onto the campus (there is a broad paved walkway leading into the
campus from that intersection).  At the first intersection you will see a
life sized bronze status of Ben Franklin sitting on a park bench reading a
newspaper.  Turn LEFT at this intersection and Steinberg-Dietrich Hall is
the first building on the Right.  There is a broad entrance with several
doors.  Also, any student can direct you to this building.  Go inside and
take the staircase DOWN to the right -- ROOM 350 is on the LOWER (basement)
level.

ACCOMMODATIONS

Overnight accommodations are available at the Inn At Penn which is across
the street from the campus (tel  215-222-0200 - mention you are here for
the Emerging Tech conference on E-Commerce Shakeouts, to receive the
$164/night Wharton room rate).  Please make your reservations EARLY because
the Inn is often fully booked.    We have reserved a set of rooms for this
event.

If you stay at another hotel in Center City, most hotels (Rittenhouse,
Latham, Ritz Carlton) are approximately 15 minutes by taxi from the campus.
There is also a Sheraton approximately 3 blocks from the campus, on
Chestnut St.

Vince, I am quite grateful. Thanks for arranging this.

By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus 
this spring before school lets out?? If not, let's definitely plan on 
scheduling a time during the coming fall 2001 semester when you can visit 
campus and present a lecture to my risk management students.

Sincerely,

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk

Raymond Cote
Vice President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that 
combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and 
financial  institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Shmuel,

What about the following: "Volatility of Electricity Prices. Measurement and
Analysis of Underlying Causes."

What about dinner on the 23rd, following the presentation?  I shall be on the
campus on the 16th, but it seems that my presentation to the students will
end rather late (assuming they will show up). Please, let me know what you
think.

Subject: Spring 2001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. Skilling


Rick / Vince,

Good morning.

In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the
keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.  The following day's four
topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
several academics.

Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
availability for that evening?

Thanks,
Ehud Ronn

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student 
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.? Rusty is 
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest 
in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these 
issues pertain to the energy industry.?? In fact, you met Rusty during your 
recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma 
Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an 
interview for a summer internship on April 19.? He has been invited by Althea 
Gordon.? If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his 
visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.?  Rusty is one of the very 
best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would 
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

Here is a short note on potential research with Wharton.  Please review and 
edit and then we can send some indication to the Wharton guys.    ----------

 The objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take, 
and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise 
chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure.  In 
particular, one can view Enron as a hierarchy of companies, and assuming we 
can separately quantify the risks of each unit, what framework would one use 
to analyze risk at Enron? 
  A related question is how one should represent risks in the different 
units?  Risks may be of different types --- short-term volatility risk, 
catastrophic risk, liquidity risk, etc --- what should one focus on for a 
first cut?
 Another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance 
both at the unit level and the enterprise level, and relate the decision to 
get insurance to the cost/benefit of insurance.

Hi Melinda!

We need to get this to John Henderson, but he did not come up on my eMail.  
Otherwise, likely any manager level at New Power would know.  Any help in 
forwarding would be great!  Thanks!

Hi Christie and Vince,

We really look forward to seeing you all next week.  We've learned a lot 
working on this project, and think we will provide some useful information 
for you.

If possible, we need to know what states NewPower is operating in.  
Specifically, what states there is a current marketing campaign?  Should I 
ask Melinda McCarty for this information?

Thanks again for your help.

Regards,

Tiger Team 3

Ashley,

This is one resume I got today. I think that it makes sense to invite him
for an interview directly with my group. He does not qualify as an analyst 
candidate.
What do you think?

As a result of recent deregulation in states such as Pennsylvania and 
California, many new companies are entering the retail energy market.  Today, 
consumers in several states are able to choose their energy provider in much 
the same way they choose their long-distance phone company.  A survey has 
been commissioned by the research group to better understand which factors 
are most important to consumers considering switching energy providers.  

The survey consists of 28 question, and can be found on the following website:

http://www.energy-survey.addr.com/survey.htm

If you, your spouse, or someone else in your family has time to take this 
survey, we would appreciate your input.

Feel free to forward this email to others.  Thanks for your time and 
consideration.

According to my count, that make a total of 8 students from the Enron Tiger

Bryan,

I shall  call you later today when I have a chance to read the message from 
Ben.

I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice). We are talking to 
the Wharton School
about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or 
more  research projects
with them.

One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a 
symposium in Paris on June 10
 on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you
(or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to 
evaluate the usefulness
of this project.

I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.

Vincent,

It was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday, and I
look forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a variety
of topics pertaining to emerging technologies.

Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation,
agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at
Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any
questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or
you can call him at 215-898-1231.

This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that
Enron's involvement will give the company access to some of the early
research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved
as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have
opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of
the partnership "benefits."

Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:

Friday, September 8
"WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?"
This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited.
We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative.
Major issues addresses include "New Economics of the Web" and
"Internet, Anywhere."

Friday, October 20
"FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES"
Designed by the ET core group and
presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.

As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging
Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of
our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join
the program.

To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the
symposium in Paris on June 10 to "test drive" the program.

I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your
convenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Program
would be of value.

Please call or email if you have any comments or questions.

best regards,
Michael

Vince,

Thank you for forwarding the following messages.  I am sorry that I am just 
now getting back to you, my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday. 

We currently have the Cal Berkeley General Presentation set for Wednesday, 
October 18th at 7:00 p.m. which works out well because it is just prior to 
the time deadline for students to submit their resumes.  The General 
Presentation is a general overview of Enron, the Program, the interview 
process, as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with Enron reps.  
Since this is the first year that we are recruiting from Cal Berkeley, I 
think that it is important that I attend this event on campus so that I can 
answer any interview process questions.  I will check the schedule and see if 
it is possible to move the presentation to the 23rd.  The only negative is 
that I will not be able to attend because I will be conducting interviews at 
Rice that day.  Also, it is very difficult to find a location to hold the 
presentation, and I need to check on location availability on the 23rd.

However, I do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus.  
This may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus.  Perhaps, we can 
also set up some other presentations for the 23rd or even the Monday prior.  
Although I would like to be able to attend the class/seminar presentations, I 
don't think that it is as vital as the General Presentation.

What are your thoughts?

Thanks,
Ashley

Shmuel,

Thanks for the message. I am working with our recruiter, Ashley Baxter,
to finalize the date of the trip. I shall shoot for October the 23rd
if this date works for the rest of our team.

Dear Vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you about the
date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If you can
schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient
lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their financial
engineering students.
Shmuel.

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.

Unfortunately I do not have a phone right now so I will have to call as soon 
as they get me up and running.  I went ahead and sent out the dates we have 
on schedule currently with the intention that if we get new dates they will 
be announced in the team meeting on Thursday.    Hope that is okay.  I needed 
to get a message out to participant soon so we don't get in a bind in a 
couple of weeks.

Subject: Carnegie Mellon Team Meeting

Greetings, Carnegie Mellon Recruiting Team!

Each of you has been chosen to represent Enron for our Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at Carnegie Mellon University.  As part of the team, you will be 
challenged with choosing the best candidates from Carnegie Mellon's Graduate 
School to join our Associate Program.

Our first campus event will be on September 15 and interviews will be held on 
campus December 11 and 12.  I hope you are all able to participate in the 
exciting process of recruiting young talent.

We will be more formally organising ourselves in the next couple of weeks.  
Currently, we are planning to have a brief team meeting in order to make 
introductions, inform you about the Associate Program, and discuss the fall 
recruiting calendar.  To that end, please contact me with any questions or 
comments you may have.

The team meeting date is set for August 31st at 10am in room 19C2.

Please RSVP to me as soon as possible.  

I look forward to meeting you all soon.

Sincerely,

Kristin Gandy

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

It was a great pleasure to work you with on this project.
The entire Enron team was impressed by the quality of the students 
and commitment of the School to exploring new and creative
ways of exposing students to business problems.

Vince;

I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed working with Enron on the Tiger
Project.  I found the interaction with you and your colleagues very
stimulating.  The ideas we covered (like whether there are network
externalities in these markets) was more like a workshop than a project.  I
wish all businessmen had your interests and capabilities.

Thanks

Dear Dr. McMullen,

A few weeks ago I received a call from your University
regarding employment opportunities at Enron.

I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a
candidate):

1. mathematical finance
2. computer programming (C, C++)
3. understanding of the energy markets

I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.

I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential
opportunities for graduates with different profiles.

Please, feel free to call me. My number is 713 853 3848.

Kevin Hannon is the executive lead for Cornell and he needs to approve.   I 
am not sure if they have already interviewed on campus.  He should go through 
the on-campus screening process before attending a Super Saturday.  We are 
reserving the Super Saturday weekend for individuals that are highly likely 
to receive an offer.  I will forward this to Kevin and Kristin Gandy.  
Although they are responsible for Graduate recruiting at Cornell, perhaps it 
is possible for him to interview when they go on campus.
Charlene

Kevin and Kristin,
Please see Vince's message below. Would it be possible for an undergraduate 
to interview while you are at Cornell?  Please let me know.

Dear Ms. Crenshaw,

On November 28, I sent Vince Kaminski an email inviting him to visit Baylor 
University (where I now hold an appointment as Professor of Finance & 
Insurance; having resigned from LSU this pas spring).? I have yet to receive 
a reply from him.? Can you bring this email (copied below) to his attention?

Thanks,

Jim Garven

===========================

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX. My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing. I am curious whether your schedule 
might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our 
dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national 
risk management fraternity. For that matter, would you also possibly be 
available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on 
the previous day (Thursday, February 22)? What I have in mind is a 
presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes. 

Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Dear Mr. Kaminski

Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care
who
they infect near the end of the semester, they just want to get done!

Here is my available schedule for next year.  I am now overloaded next week
with tasks to complete the semester.  I do hope that we can reschedule
during the first quarter next year.

I would note that my schedule is most free for Thursday or Friday.  I could
fly out late Wednesday night.

Cordially,

Gerry

Dr. Kaminski:

I am the PhD student at the business school at Carnegie Mellon who is
interested in energy modeling. Thanks once again for taking the time
to talk with me about my model for electricity during your recent
visit to Carnegie Mellon. During our conversation, you had mentioned
the possibility of my coming out to Enron to work on developing my
model, possibly through an internship. Is this still an option? If so,
could you please advise me how to proceed.

Sincerely,

Aziz A. Lookman

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will
have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Best Regards,

Aisha Jamal

Christie,

Thanks for helping out.  Attached is a one page "intro" to the project that
Vince and I are undertaking.  Please let me know how you would like it
"transformed" before passing it along to the leadership at Enron.

You have the basic story--Enron's leadership purposefully and very
successfully transformed the company.  We plan to document in broad strokes
the "plan" as it was set out, and trace its evolution through the history
of Enron's history.  The final result will be a 20-40 page paper written in
the style of a Harvard Business Review piece.

Please let me know what else you may need.  I'll put it together for you.

Thanks again,

John

Pierre-Philippe,

Thanks for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation in early
November. I understand the presentation are on Fridays and November the 3rd
would be the best date for me.

If you prefer November the 10th, we have to wait a few more days with the
decision. We have a management conference every year in San Antonio and it
will be held either in the 2nd or the 3rd week of November. I shall know in a
few days. The same goes for November 9, assuming it was not a mistake (it's
Thursday).

I shall be free for dinner on the day of the conference. Thanks for the
invitation.

 Vince

Vince,

I am writing to ask for your help with some research I am doing with John
Lehoczky and a PhD student.  We trying to apply recent advances in Monte
Carlo for American options to value Swing and other options with multiple
early exercise decisions that are important in energy markets.  I know in
general that early exercise shows up in a wide range of energy contracts,
both real as welll as financial.  Would it be possible for you, either via
email or on the phone, to give us some examples of typical terms for such
instruments?  We would like our examples to look realistic.  We also want to
make sure we are focusing on the right sorts of optionality.

Thanks in advance,
Duane

Vince,

I have added a lot of material to "fill in the wholes" and would like your
reaction to the current draft.  I am still not very happy with the risk
management segment (primarily as a result of my own lack of knowledge) so
please read it carefully and get me your comments.

I plan to let Don Chew (the editor) take a look at it to give us his
guidance toward a successful draft.

Hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year.

Your friend

john

p.s. I really enjoyed your papers.  those should definitely be part of a
class on risk management.

Subject: Fwd: Summer Internship--Ph.D. in Chicago


Hi, Vince,

This is Li, writing from U. of Chicago.
I am in the second quarter here.
The study and social life is extremely busy at the school.
But I enjoy connecting the knowledge I learn everyday here
with the experience I had with Enron.

A schoolmate of mine, a Chicago Ph.D. candidate in finance,
is looking for an internship for the coming summer.
I recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in
or if there is a need. If so, you can contact with him directly.
He is a really bright guy. If not, hope you don't mind that
I sell Enron at school so hard.

Again, thanks for all the help you gave me.
Have a good new year.

Li

P.S.: Cover letter below and resume attached.

Dear Dr. Vince Kaminski,

I am a Ph.D. student in Finance at the University of Chicago GSB who =
hopes to find a summer internship at Enron of 2001 (between June and =
September). I heard your group from my friend Li, who worked at Enron =
for 3 year. She spoke highly of you. If it's okay, I am primarily =
interested in Risk management.
At the University of Chicago, I will have completed all the Ph.D. =
courses in the area of finance by the end of the first year. As normally =
it takes two years to finish the required finance courses, I decided to =
take all the finance courses in the first year. In the fall quarter, I =
already took Empirical Asset Pricing and Theoretical Asset Pricing and =
did very well. In the winter quarter, I will be taking Corporate =
Finance, Continuous Time Finance and Behavioral Finance. I am exposed to =
all fields of finance. Prior to coming to Chicago, I received a Master's =
degree in Economics at Washington University in Saint Louis where I =
acquired skills in economic analysis. I also have a strong background in =
statistics and mathematics. This makes me believe that I have acquired =
the ability to do financial research.

Prior to coming to the United State, I was an outstanding graduate from =
Beijing University, China. I was the founder and President of Beijng =
Univeristy Society of Oceanology. I also organized a research jouney in =
the round-the-Bo-Sea Economic Region. These experience helped to hone my =
communication and interpersonal skills.

As illustrated above, my skills and expertise are ideally suited for =
financial research. My resume is enclosed. In the event that you think =
an interview is in need, my time is very flexible. Your assistance is =
appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Ken,

It seems that there may be an Internet bias as well (more affluent 
and educated households are on-line).

One solution: develop a control group. Arm-twist clerical 
employees of the School to fill out the questionnaire
and also ask them to provide the questionnaire to their friends  and families.

Vince

Hi Anne!

Thank you for your reply.  Enron is delighted to be a part of the Wharton 
Business Plan Competition!

First, our assistant in the University Affairs Group, Melinda McCarty, will 
provide you with our logo.

Enron would definitely like to be Judge in Phase III and Participate in the 
Venture Fair, including the display table.

As to the mentoring and University community program, let;s discuss that 
further so I can better judge our way forward.

After I've had the chance to discuss all of this with our entire University 
Affairs and Wharton team here at Enron, you and I can get together to plan a 
more difinitive participatory strategy for Enron.  I will call you next week.

Again, we at Enron are very enthusiastic about participation with Wharton in 
this mutually interesting endeavor.!

Best regards!

--Christie.

Dear Christie:

Thank you for your voice mail. Things  are moving along nicely with the 
competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some 
statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase 
I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let 
me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.

* We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we 
could get your logo.

* Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair 
(VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business 
plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon

*  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The 
VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture 
capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in 
Philadelphia on April 30th.

* At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot 
table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you 
wish to use the exhibit space.

*  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one 
mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day 
commitment.

*  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.  
Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?

I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,


Anne Stamer

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince

Dr. Bill McMullen called you this morning and said that you had called
the school last week asking for courses that they scheduled for quantitive
analysis.

They gave your name to Dr. McMullen and he would like you to email
him exactly what you are looking for.

His email address is:  mcmullew@tamug.tamu.edu

Folks:

I have tentatively set the date for our first round-table discussion for 
Wednesday, 
December 20th at 3:00pm-4:30pm.  The room, EB3268, will be available from 
3:00 to 5:00pm.   If any of you have an issue with the date, please let me 
know by 
day's end.

Professor Don Kouri of the Physics Department of the University of Houston 
will start 
with an informal 30-45 minute presentation (see appended abstract below) of 
his work 
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have.

Professor Kouri, please let me know if you have any requirements for 
audiovisual 
or other equipment.

This excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the 
subject of our meeting:

[...]   topics to
be discussed at a small ``roundtable'' format meeting, are:

1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling'', data
extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital
data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential
operators to digital data, etc.)

2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems.

There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust
for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which
you are interested, I am willing to focus on them. 
[...]"

Folks:

I am trying to set up a meeting with professor Don Kouri of the University of 
Houston and I believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion.  
If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for 
yourselves, please let me know.

This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area 
of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and 
attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).

We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the 
seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester 
season for schools).

A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be 
talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about 
the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earth's atmosphere.

next week.  Also, can you tell me Paula's last name that we rode with the

1. An overview of the Modern Giants research project

2. Descriptions of three broad areas of research interest (business and
organizational design, new business creation, and capital investment
decision making) together with the associated interview questions.

We fully understand that these interview questions are far too
encompassing, and that there's no way we could get through all of them in a
single, one-hour meeting. What we plan to do is "specialize" the interviews
by the background and expertise of participants. In some cases, we will
focus only on new business creation; in others, we will focus primarily on
the allocation of capital; in others we will focus on the basic economic
model that underlies the trading or energy services business. Future visits
may focus on the remaining, unanswered questions, or on other areas of
interest of our faculty colleagues. These questions should therefore be
regarded more as a set of interests, rather than a strict protocol that we
will strive to complete from beginning to end.
Hope this provides the necessary background for the trip.

Vince and Stinson,

Just got a copy of the attached paper and thought it may have some interest
for you guys.

On another note, I am putting together a workshop in the spring on the New
Economy and Business Education and will be seeking out some Enron network
people to join in the discussion (2-hours on Friday March 2nd).  I'll let
you know more as we work through the details.  The idea is to "brainstorm"
about the new world you guys work in every day and its implications for
what we should be doing.  Hope this is interesting to you and that you'll
want to spend the day with us.

Take care and enjoy the weekend.

John

Recruiting Season is quickly approaching and I wanted to go ahead and make 
everyone aware of the first event at Cal Berkely this Fall.  The Cal Berkeley 
Career Fair will take place on Friday, September 8th.  We would like to take 
three representatives on campus to discuss the Analyst Program as well as the 
Global Technology Track.  Travel arrangements would involve leaving on 
Thursday evening, September 7th, to recruit on campus all day Friday.  If you 
think that you may be available to help with this event, please click on the 
button below.




We will discuss this and other events/dates on campus this Fall during the 
Team Meeting on Tuesday, August 29th at 2:00 in 49C4.  At that time we will 
have sign-up sheets so that you can attend events that best fit in your 
schedule.  I will also follow up with an e-mail similar to this so that 
everyone is able to express their date/event preferences.  

Thanks so much for helping recruit at Cal Berkeley this Fall.  If you have 
any questions, please feel free to contact me at 3-3589.

Ashley

Dr. Lu,

I would be grateful if I could talk with you some time about the typical
terms one sees in Swing, take or pay, virtual storage, etc. options.  This
is related to some research some colleagues and I are doing applying recent
innovations in Monte Carlo valuation of options with early exercise.  We
would like to illustrate our techniques on some examples which look
realistic.  When would be convenient for you?

I look forward to talking with you.

Pierre-Philippe,

The time of the presentation, 11:30 is fine with me.
I shall arrive Thu evening and I shall get to the hotel by cab. Thanks
for your kind offer to meet me at the airport but I shall be arriving at late 
hour
and don't want to inconvenience you. Kevin Kindall from Enron will come with 
me.
I shall also need a projector for my M/S Power Point presentation on
"Volatility in the US Power Markets".
I shall be very glad to meet with Duane. 

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

The presentation is scheduled on friday the 3rd at 11.30 so that New York
Students can attend.

Would you like me to get you at the airport?

If you want I can also organize a short meeting with professor Seppi which
is very interested in energy derivatives.

My goal is to make your trip to Pittsburgh as pleasant as possible.
Therefore if there is anything I can do to help (I am sounding a little
repetitive...I know) let me know.

Sincerely,

Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie

Thanks. 

Dhabol is one. There should be 2 more case studies we used.
One about old EGS, the 2nd about TVA options.

2-3 copies will be sufficient.

Dear Celeste and Kristin:

I am re-sending information regarding the Wharton Entrepreneurship
Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as
participate in the Expo.  We are expecting the conference to double in
size with more than 1000 attendees.  In addition, we would like to
emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside
of the "dot.com" world including in large, innovative companies such as
Enron.  We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including
Christy Jones of Trilogy and PCOrder as well as Anita Roddick of The
Body Shop.  We would be very interested to have the participation of
Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a
participant in our career expo.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Cassandra Santos

Jennifer, 

Thanks for your note!  As these trip details get more formalized, I'll keep 
yopu copied.  For now, know that there are approximately 18 Wharton students 
participating in 3  research projects-- Enron proposed topics-- called the 
"Tiger Program".  They'll be visiting Enron, arriving Houston Thursday the 
18th, Dinner at Churrasco's (their choice) on the 18th, Enron meetings on the 
19th.

As the details unfold, I'll keep you and Jeff copied.

Thanks!

Mark!

Please review the attached article and forward your comments/authorization 
for its use to John Martin at Baylor, copying me and Vince.

John and Vince,

I have a few simple comments:

1. Please use "Enron Corp." [rather than "Enron Corporation"]

2.  page 3: as of yesterday, Fortune Magazine named Enron "most innovative" 
for the SIXTH year in a row

3.  page 5:  2nd paragraph:  regarding the "gas bank" concept--I believe when 
Jeff first introduced it, it fell flat. I think John pick's that up (and 
Enron's subsequent recovery of a version of the concept on p.6), but it's 
probably accurate to mention that at first, it didn't go over.

4.  page 13: re: Cindy Olson's comment on a possible 5 X difference between  
a "satisfactory" and "superior" VP--the difference referred to is probably 
the "bonus" rather than "compensation" (which , to me, is generally means 
base salary); also, it varies for each review period, as comparative 
performance might vary;   further, we might want to run that quote by Cindy 
just to make sure she's OK with it's publication (she might have no problem 
with it whatsoever, but I know for other articles, she's been more reluctant 
to provide that kind of  statistic).

5.  page 17 (after Annual report quote): I suggest changing "Enron's 
wholesale business... provides" to "...businesses..provide";  also, rather 
than "Enron Wholesale" we might want to define this by the term Enron uses: 
"Enron Wholesale Services"

6.  page 18: 2nd paragraph: the tense switching from past to present is 
technically correct if read carefully , but seems awkward when reading it

7.  page 19: effective February, Jeff Skilling is "CEO".

...that's my 2-cents worth!!   I think the article is great...even 
interesting (ha!)...even to non-MBA's like me!!

Thanks!

--Christie.

I am sending you the final (?) draft of the paper by John Martin
on Enron's transformation. John Martin is a prof from Baylor who visited us

Vince,

Attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together.  Our timetable
is very short as we need an "approved by Enron" version of the paper to Don
by next Wednesday.  Don has already made editorial changes for us and may
make some additional "writing style" changes but he doesn't change the
content.

I'll give you a call later today to alert you to the e-mail.

take care,

john

p.s. i had a nice conversation with steve.  sounds like he's landed a
pretty good contract with Wiley.

Jeff,

I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton
School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate 
Relations Officer
at Wharton.

Recommendation.

I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.
The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate
Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently,
the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies 
worldwide.

The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K,
that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, 
Citigroup,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed 
through
grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The 
choice
of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time
depending on the business needs.

Benefits to Enron. 

Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:

 - gaining advance access to current academic research  
 - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,
   enhancing   our recruiting efforts
 - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant
                   influence on public opinion
        - gaining access to high quality executive education programs

Specific Programs.

The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. 
I have
identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.

1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella
    for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research 
and 
    corporate engagement related to e-commerce.

    Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and
    enhanced recruitment opportunities.

2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary
    program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing 
intellectual
    property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal
    organizational structures.

    Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of 
valuation of
    intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.

3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for
    assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the 
scope
    of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments). 

    Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination
    of information about our capabilities in this area.

Potential users of the program at Enron.

My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and 
Decision Process Center.

Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of 
Enron can be involved 
with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.

We are excited that you want to interview the Comp finance students.

Do you want to do it in Dec. or before?  Let me know what best suits you.
Since there are only 16 individuals in the Pittsburgh area... we should be
able to accomodate you...Would you want one or two schedules..?

  What is the formal protocol in such matters?

What program is Vince interested in having a satellite program?  When he was
here he seemed less intererted in Comp finance and more interested in
E-commerce.

I sent a note to Michael Shamos and Tridas discussing this.

Let me know which program and I will see if we can work anything out?

Vince and Christie:

Again, many thanks for inviting and hosting the Tiger Team for an on-site
visit.  It was a wonderful opportunity to meet and attend the very
informative briefings from the many senior level contacts you provided to
learn more about Enron overall. It was enlightening and exciting to learn so
much about Enron.  What a great company!  The trip got rave reviews from the
students.  You were delightful and most accommodating hosts.

As for the project, I am in the process of confirming dates and locations
for the weekly Thursday (4:00-6:00pm EST) videoconferences with Enron and
will copy you on the email to the students. I know they are anxious to begin
to narrow the scope as soon as possible so that can begin the research and
analysis of their particular projects.

Thank you for your time and support of the project.


Sincerely,

 Per our conversation yesterday,  I will have a job description for the Comp 
Finance students sometime today.  I have also gone through the MBA resume 
stack yet again.  The person who requested the phone interview is Troy 
Mischke.  He works for Pratt & Whitney in Florida.  CMU has a Flexmode 
Program, which is another phrase for distance learning.

 It turns out that there are a number of people that work for Pratt & Whitney 
in Florida.  My guess is that they all know each other, and decided to take 
the Flexmode Program together.  Here are the names

 Tony Garcia
 K. Todd Kuykendall
 Timothy Leonard
 Troy Mischke

 Only Troy requested the phone interview, although Tony Gacia did send a 
cover letter.  What is the best path forward?

It seems like several of you will be on vacation next week, so lets see if
we can do it this week.  Vince is available on Thursday from 2:00 - 3:00 PM
or Friday, from 1:30 - 2:30 PM.  

Do either one of these two times work?

Let me know.

Thanks!

Vince, thanks for your very prompt email response. I passed your message 
along to Dave.

Thanks also for a great dinner and day of meetings last week. I really 
enjoyed the chance to learn more about Enron, and was very impressed with 
everyone I met.

Look forward to working with you these next few months!!

Cheers,
Vincent

Vincent,

I have forwarded the resume to our Analysts / Associate pool with
a recommendation to accept David as a summer intern.

I expressed interest in taking him into my group. He may, of course,
work for a different unit of Enron. It's up to him and I shall not be
offended
if he would like to go into trading or deal origination.

Vince

Folks:

It is my pleasure to announce the visit of professor Rene Carmona from 
Princeton on February 13, 2001. 
(This web site may provide a little information on professor Carmona:

Professor Carmona is going to talk to us about his research endeavors in 
weather and financial engineering.
Similarly, we will make a short presentation of our activities and research 
interests.

The aim of the meeting is to explore areas of common interest and investigate 
the possibility of collaborating in certain research areas.

The time is 2:00-3:30 pm.  Room EB30C1 is reserved for 2:00-4:30pm.

Please plan on attending.  Also, do let me know, if you would like to include 
someone else to this distribution list.

Vince, I am checking the date on Jeff's calendar (I'm assuming the date is 
February 22?).  I am holding that date whole week for a trip abroad, but I 
think we have some flexibility on that and am checking it out.  I'll be back 
in touch as soon as I've resolved that.  SRS

Subject: University of Texas conference on energy finance, February 2001

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince

Update:

Preparations for the upcoming Texas Finance Festival III are about complete
and I just wanted to update you on the hotel reservations information.  You
will need to make your reservation before March 20 to be assured of getting
a room in our reserved block.  Also, for "counting" purposes I need
everyone's registration form completed.  Many of you (and a lot of new
faces) have already sent them in but some may not have, so . . .

Lots of fun stuff is planned so come prepared for a very relaxing and
productive weekend!

John,

I am forwarding to you the request by Jens.  We gave in the past 
our forward oil curves (with approval of Greg Whalley) to some academics.
What is your position on this request?

Vince,

As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received 
from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the 
head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, 
he is writing a study about the hedging 
strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would 
like to get forward oil prices form us.

The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point 
for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be 
ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly 
or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. 

Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities 
in Germany, it would be great if we could help 
him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.

Jens

Subject: Daten


Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,

bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof.
Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer
darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie
benoetigt wuerden.

Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil
Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle
angibt:

" In addition to the publicly available futures data described above,
for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources
made available some proprietary historical forward price curves
from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were
used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine
years"

Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten
verfuegbar hat.

Nun zum idealen Datensatz:

Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer
Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum
Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe
Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit
Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.

Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht
erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein
kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.

Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen
koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.

Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse

Olaf Korn


p.s. Bei Rueckfragen stehe ich Ihnen jederzeit gern zur Verfuegung

Hello Shmuel,

Thanks for your message. The end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 were 
extremely busy 
and I could not focus on PSERC issues. I shall consult a few people in Enron 
on this subject and get in
touch with you. Our concern right now is that the results of research are 
widely shared with
our competition.

I am out on the 19th, but the 20th would work for me. I would be glad to 
cover the cost of your Austin
to Houston trip.

Regarding your son. The Analyst / Associate program will interview again on 
the campus
in the spring and they will be more than happy to interview him.

Hello Vince
Happy Holidays.
I wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of Enron Joining
PSERC. As you might have heard from Lance and Alex we are going through a
transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry
members within the last year. Consequently, our business processes are not
well developed. One of the problems we are facing is the balance between the
electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested
in market related research. I hope to recruit more of the later so tat we
have more of a constituency in the Advisory Board  that sees the value of
market related research. I already have a verbal commitment from people at
Electrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC. With members like
Electrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projects
such as the one that Shijie Deng proposed (not funded in this round). Please
let me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron. I am
going to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing and
could come through Huston for a visit. Attached are some items that I shared
with our PSERC members and thought that you might be interested in them as
well.
Regards, Shmuel.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Christie,

     Thanks again for taking the time to visit Wharton and share about Enron 
and our upcoming project.  I know each of us is excited about the opportunity 
to learn and contribute to Enron.  Specifically, thank you for the awesome 
dinner at the Palladium.  It was a great way to get to know you, Visant, and 
Vince better.
     I look forward to visiting Houston in January.  Please let me know if 
you need any additional information with regard to the trip.  Have a great 
holiday season, and I look forward to seeing each of you in January.

Sincerely,
Jason Cummins

(one-month in advance).

Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze

your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as
Jeff is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and
one
of the most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders.

Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can
do
for any of you.

Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron!

Good afternoon,

I just want to give you a reminder about the one-page questionnaire
regarding arrival and departure times for the workshop.  Your responses
will make planning a bit easier on this end.  Also, please get me your
"one-page" background statement as soon as possible.  I am attaching
Michael Froehl's to give you some guidance (thanks Michael, I thought I was
going to have to prepare mine first).

Let me also tell you that the television producer has requested 15 minutes
of each of your time either the morning of the 23rd before the luncheon or
after the workshops to do individual interviews.  They will then work these
individual shots into the final edited program (bring your best TV smiles).
 By the way, I have been assured by the producer that we have final say
over whether particular comments are edited in or out of the final product
so we can all relax, this is not live TV.

I'll be out of town the end of next week but hope to have all my plans put
together the following week so please respond to both the questionnaire and
the request for a one-page background/positions/ideas write-up.

Thanks guys and I'm looking forward to seeing you all very soon.

John

p.s. In case you've misplaced it I have appended a copy of the questionnaire.

Thanks.  Yes it is unfortunate that we were not able to quickly identify who

Also, thanks for agreeing to help out with Stanford.  Hopefully we will get a

Her resume has been forwarded to you.

Vince:

Thank you to you, Ken and Christie for coming to campus for the Enron Tiger
Team Mid-Project review.  The students are working hard and appreciate your
insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the
Wharton School.

Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me
that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.

I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having
summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted
positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean
they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize
and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I
think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the
agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview
week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an
added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.

Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel
should proceed.


Thank you,

Hi Vince,

I just got off the phone with donna piazze at Wharton, (I don't know if there 
is a relationship with Tom at Wharton), and we were discussing there Tiger 
Teams.  It is a required research program, 2nd semester for MBAs, and Wharton 
would love to have Enron participate.  I told her there is probably some real 
life reasearch project we could have the students do.  She did  also mention 
that it is one of the best recruiting tools under development at wharton..  I 
gave her your number.

Her number is 215 573 8394.  Please call her when you get a chance within the 
week.

Mark, can we get christy involved?  Thanks everyone.

Jeff

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in responding to you.
I am currently in London, flying back to Houston tomorrow.

The problem is not  with the lawyers. We worked on our presentation
materials together with a professor from another university
and we agreed to use these materials only internally.

We have to honor our commitment to him. I am sure
that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had
made a similar commitment to you.

Vince

 What do I need to do to move this thing forward?
I suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers.  They only know how 
to stop things, but in a way they play a role in global society.  If it were 
not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a 
chance.

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Hey Vince,

Thanks for your reply.  I'll see what becomes of the session and keep you
informed.  As to the paper, Tim Crack and I have a revised version of the
paper I gave you.  We have since found out that by using certainty
equivalence, our model is more robust.  For example, if one has an asset
pricing model that incorporates mean, variance, and skewness (Harvey and
Siddique, JF June, 2000) and a binomial model that incorporates mean,
variance, and skewness (Johnson, Paulukiewicz, and Mehta, RQFA, 1997), our
model allows you to price options under the real world measure.  The
benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical
data that is non-risk neutralized.
   From a pricing perspective, there isn't a tremendous benefit in a
mean-variance world (variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky
measure).  However,in the mean-variance-skewness world, there is a benefit
because we do not believe (although we're still hunting down an appropriate
cite) skewness is the same under risk-neutral and risky measure.  Given we
can only measure the skewness in our risky world, our model becomes much
more significant.
   I would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you
have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like
to see it.

Thanks again,

Tom

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

It goes without saying that whoever come with you is invited for dinner.
Would you prefer to have dinner on Thursday night or Friday night. I think
it would be better Friday night as we could discuss the presentation.


Sincerely,

Vince,
We have not started our spring hiring yet.  However, we will review and let 
him know we have an interest and tell him when we will be interviewing on 
campus.  Thanks

Althea and Shelly,
Please keep track of his resume so that he is considered for a summer 
position when we begin the spring recruiting.  Thanks

John,

I shall be traveling Thu and Fri this week and Mon and Tue next week. 
Please, give me a call Tuesday morning and I shall  carve out 
an hour from my schedule to discuss the paper. Stinson will be gone for three 
weeks so
we have to do the work without him.

Alternatively, we can delay the conversation till next week.

Vince

Subject: Update


Vince,

Sorry I haven't been pressing you on the paper but there's always more to
do than we have time for.  However, I had a phone call from the editor
encouraging me to get the paper to him by Christmas so it could serve as
the centerpiece of his energy issue.  His comment to me was "everyone wants
to know what Enron's doing".  So, with that said I'll try to put together a
list of materials that I have collected and maybe we can have a phone
conversation to get your ideas on a plan to put the paper together.  The
Harvard cases do a nice job of laying out institutional and historical
details but we will need a "tack" or theme to begin the writing process.

By the way, we have managed to delay the Spring Texas Finance Festival one
week so that it will not coincide with Easter (hope you can now attend).
We didn't have too many problems with the Easter weekend but there were
some and we would prefer not to use that weekend either.

Hope all is going well for you guys.  Tell Stinson hello for me.

Your friend,

John

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

 It is a great pleasure and a great honor to schedule you on the MSCF
Speaker Series list for November 3rd, I will make reservation for 8 persons
at a restaurant in Pittsburgh for that evening. Also, if you want I can book
an hotel for you.

Let me know if you have anything in mind  for the topic of the presentation.
There is no real guidelines as we like our speakers to have as much room as
possible. Here is one of the past presentations that had an impact. One of
our speakers divided the presentation in two, the first part was technical,
the second was more general, explaining what his firm was looking for when
hiring new employees.

Thank you very much for accepting our invitation.

Sincerely,




Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie

Vince and Stinson,

Just got a copy of the attached paper and thought it may have some interest
for you guys.

On another note, I am putting together a workshop in the spring on the New
Economy and Business Education and will be seeking out some Enron network
people to join in the discussion (2-hours on Friday March 2nd).  I'll let
you know more as we work through the details.  The idea is to "brainstorm"
about the new world you guys work in every day and its implications for
what we should be doing.  Hope this is interesting to you and that you'll
want to spend the day with us.

Take care and enjoy the weekend.

John

Celeste,

It seems that the process lasted too long for some students
and only Kim Whitsel is interested in the internship at this point.

Her resume has been forwarded to you.
I am enclosing it just in case.
Thanks for your help.

Vince:

Thank you to you, Ken and Christie for coming to campus for the Enron Tiger
Team Mid-Project review.  The students are working hard and appreciate your
insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the
Wharton School.

Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me
that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.

I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having
summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted
positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean
they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize
and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I
think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the
agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview
week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an
added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.

Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel
should proceed.


Thank you,

Dear Amy:

Thank you and your colleagues for taking the time to video-conference with
us at MIT and AA professionals associated with NEVRL.  I  enjoyed the
exchange and was left impressed by the technical savvy and keen interest in
research on part of Enron.  I look forward to hearing from you sometime
soon.

As I recall, we agreed that Enron would forward a few issues/questions that
NEVRL could potentially address.  Once we have a meeting of minds on the
set of issues, we can discuss further how best to collaborate and
accomplish our goals.  I believe both sides would benefit immensely.  MIT
faculty can research questions relevant to industry and you might receive
some answers you are looking for!

With best regards,

Vince,
I must apologize to you about the version of the paper i sent last evening.
i was pretty exhausted from the day and didn't stop to give it a proof
reading (on paper). I still find that screen editing is a poor substitute
for holding the paper and marking it up.
There is still work to be done but I think the paper is improving with each
iteration. I want to work more on documenting the specific "events leading
up to the formation of the new unregulated business" including some
documentation on the deregulation process and events in the natural gas
market. Specifically, I remember conversations about "take or pay" contract
defaults, etc. and the financial crisis they created. Also, Gene Humphries
commented in a round table discussion that Sheridan held at UT that Carl
Ichan made a play for Enron and this was fended off with a leveraged ESOP.
I would like to get all the details to these issues to better "set up the
section on marching to the beat of a new drummer".
I hope this process isn't too frustrating for you. I am convinced that we
will winnow out the story in the end if we persevere.
Have a great weekend.
your friend,
john

Vince,

Greetings!  I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at
Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin
Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and
suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions
for the Research Group at Enron.

In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the
business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron
(mary.alison.bailey@enron.com) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in
which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no
indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to
compete for these spaces.

We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance
program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR
and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your
business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our
rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest
in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a
"Speaker Series"  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would
give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students
in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better
understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give
our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.

When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?

Thank you for your time.

Hi Donna!

I'll let you know ASAP about 3/22.  I believe Vince will be in London on that 
date.

More immediately, is there a conference call tomorrow (Thursday)?  If so, is 
there a call in number established, or does Melinda set this up?  (She's out 
this afternoon).

Thanks!

--Christie.

Christie:

Professor Ravi Aron, Wharton, has been a consultant to the student Tiger
Team for the Enron project.  At his suggestion and invitation, Tiger
students have been invited to attend an e-Commerce Executive Education
seminar that is directly related to the project on which they are working.
Professor Aron will be giving the session on pricing mechanisms and B2B
market auctions.  This will take place at the Steinberg Conference Center on
campus on Thursday, March 22 from 8:30a-12:30.  We would also like to extend
an invitation for a representative from Enron to attend.

Please let me know if you or someone who has worked with the student teams
will be able to attend the seminar.

We look forward to seeing you and Vince at the final presentation on April 3
from 4:30-7:30pm in Vance Hall B6.

Regards,
Donna

Pierre-Philippe,

Yes, we are ready. I shall be accompanied by one person from
our Analyst/Associate program and I would like to ask you if she can be 
invited

We plan to come Thursday night and leave on Sat morning to avoid potential
flight delay risk.

Greetings, Carnegie Mellon Recruiting Team!

Each of you has been chosen to represent Enron for our Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at Carnegie Mellon University.  As part of the team, you will be 
challenged with choosing the best candidates from Carnegie Mellon's Graduate 
School to join our Associate Program.

campus December 11 and 12.  I hope you are all able to participate in the 
exciting process of recruiting young talent.

We will be more formally organising ourselves in the next couple of weeks.  
Currently, we are planning to have a brief team meeting in order to make 
introductions, inform you about the Associate Program, and discuss the fall 
recruiting calendar.  To that end, please contact me with any questions or 
comments you may have.

The team meeting date is set for August 31st at 10am in room 19C2.

Please RSVP to me as soon as possible.  

I look forward to meeting you all soon.

Happy New Year to all!

Don't forget to get registered early for this year's conference.  It
promises to be the best yet.  The fun stuff is already organized and the
program looks to be the best that "Trail Boss" Titman has yet produced.

Notice the "friendly encouragement" (translation discount in the
registration fee) for early registration.  The conference info and
registration form can be found at
http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/Tff2001/index.htm

Happy new year and hope to see you in San Antonio in April!

Please include Ram Vittal to the summer internship list, if you have not
already done so.
According to my count, that make a total of 8 students from the Enron Tiger

Charlene,

I coordinate my schedule with Ashley Baxter from your organization, who is 
responsible
for recruiting at Berkeley. I have talked to her about this presentation a 
few times. As you can see,
she is on the distribution list.

The presentation is scheduled for the 23rd of October. We have tried to 
combine the presentation with
another recruiting trip, but we have to many conflicting schedules.

Vince

Vince when is your presentation scheduled?  I can get someone from my group 
but since the recruiters are all on the road I would need a date so that they 
or I could coordinate with you.  Thanks

Subject: Presentation to faculty and students at Berkeley

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.


Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Shmuel S. Oren, Professor
Dept. of Industrial Engineering
and Operations Research
4117 Etcheverry Hall
University of California
Berkeley, CA 94720-1777

Hello Vince,

My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les Clewlow,
who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at Warwick
Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump
Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
come to my attention :

"The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US
POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.

and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present
and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.

Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at University
of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK,
where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach
(spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.

Thanks in advancve

Bernard Murphy

I understand that you are the lead recruiter for CMU.  As you know, I am the 
only alum from that school in Enron's Associate Program.  I assume I will be 
joining you for our corporate presentation on 9/13 at 7:30am.  Please let me 
know what I can do to help prepare for this event.  Enron and GSIA are a 
great fit, so I want this recruiting effort to go well.

Are you also giving a talk/lecture to the computational finance students?  If 
so, what time?  Maybe we can schedule a lunch with Duane Seppi.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.

 Good afternoon.  Packing emails--its just my style :)

 Currently, it is my understanding that we would like to interview the Comp. 
Fin. students during the same period that we interview the MBA's.   
Tentatively speaking, one schedule should be sufficient.  I will attempt to 
produce an official job description shortly.
 Kristen is out of town for the remainder of the week, so her response to any 
inquiries may be delayed.  Her contact info:  kristin.gandy@enron.com  713

 Regarding the satellite program, Vince is interested in the ECommerce 
program.  We think that it would be easier to keep the program full as 
compared to the Comp. Fin. program.  

 It was a pleasure to be back in Pittsburgh and I enjoyed meeting all the 
students from this year's Comp. Fin. class.  I look forward to seeing you in 
a few weeks.

We are excited that you want to interview the Comp finance students.

Do you want to do it in Dec. or before?  Let me know what best suits you.
Since there are only 16 individuals in the Pittsburgh area... we should be
able to accomodate you...Would you want one or two schedules..?

  What is the formal protocol in such matters?

If you can send me an e-mail address for Kristen, I can get this strating
asap.

What program is Vince interested in having a satellite program?  When he was
here he seemed less intererted in Comp finance and more interested in
E-commerce.

I sent a note to Michael Shamos and Tridas discussing this.

Let me know which program and I will see if we can work anything out?

Subject: meet during CMU visit?



Dr. Kaminski:

I am a Ph.D. student here at Carnegie Mellon who has a long-standing
interest in the energy industry.

I have recently developed the framework of a simple model for electricity
prices that I would like your opinion on. Could you please chalk out some
time for me during your CMU visit this Friday?

Unlike traditional electricty pricing models, which assume that the
log-price is a sum of a couple of stochastic factors, I assume that some
fundamentals of the electricity market are driven by stochastic factors.
Next, given the current values of these factors, price is determined by
economic forces of profit maximization by price setting electricity
generators. Unlike typical factor models, the factors in my model are
potentially observable.


Thank You,

Subject: RE: Houston Trip


Dear Vince / Christie,

Thanks for coming to Philadelphia to present an overview of the projects. We 
enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with 
Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as 
well.

We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and 
additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January 
19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We 
plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are 
considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either
(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to 
serve retail customers, OR
(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas 
for further investments.

However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy 
Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to 
suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; 
so please let us know.

We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but 
here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:

Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is 
in the annual report?
What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?
Who are the customers and how are they acquired?
What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron?
What are the international expansion plans and capabilities?
Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?

If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, 
will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?

After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to 
schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly 
involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in 
the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to 
call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

Just a short note to indicate that we have not heard received any information

to get some information on what issues you would like us to spend some time 
thinking about.

Hope all is well.

Shmuel,

Thanks for the invitation to speak on October 23rd.

Would you like me to split my presentation and devote
some time to the Enron Analyst/Associate program?

I plan to make presentation on   energy derivatives markets
(development of the markets in the US and Europe, valuation
challenges, Enron's role in developing the forward markets for natural gas 
and electricity).
I shall send you the bullet points in a few days.

Vince

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at IEOR very much.
I wonder if you could point me to some information
resource on Enron's bandwidth market.

I am a Ph.D student at IEOR. I work with Professor
Oren and Professor Varaiya from EECS department on
the topic of pricing the Internet. In particular, I am designing
pricing mechanism in the framework of the DiffServ
architecture which is the latest proposal made by
IETF to provide scalable service differentiation.
I would very much like to get in touch with people
in Enron working on the similar topics.

Thank you very much.

"Volatility of Electricity  Prices - Measurement and Analysis of Underlying  
Causes"
Dr.  Vincent Kaminski
Managing Director and Head of Research for Enron  Corp.

?

Abstract:

The last three years were characterized  by exceptionally high volatility of 
the power prices in the US markets. The  market developments have created a 
number of unique challenges for energy  industry economists. One immediate 
question we have to answer is how to  measure volatility of energy prices. 
Although we can all agree that the  prices in the power markets are 
characterized by high variability, the  traditional measures used in 
financial economics (annualized standard  deviation of log price returns) may 
not fit well electricity prices.  


The second challenge is to explain the  sources of high price volatility and 
to answer the question to what extent  it can be attributed to problems that 
can be addressed in the long run. Such  problems include flaws in market 
design that allow some market participants  to abuse market power, limited 
availability and/or unequal access to  transmission, temporary shortages of 
generation capacity. Some factors  underlying high volatility of electricity 
prices may be of permanent nature  and may be a necessary price to pay for 
increased market efficiency and  expanded customer choice.

Tom,

Greg's phone number is 713 853 5220. He is very difficult to reach
(frequent trips).

You may find this information useful: Greg is a West Point graduate
and spent a few years in the  military, before obtaining an MBA from Stanford.
He is a very dynamic person and a very pragmatic thinker.

I hope you have a great holiday weekend.

Vince

Vince:  Thanks for this message and update on your recent actions to
establish a closer research relationship between Enron and Wharton.  We are
anxious to work with your firm on many fronts and appreciate all that you
and Jeff Shankman are doing to facilitate closure on a number of
initiatives.

The below article is very interesting and reinforces the entrepreneurial
culture of Enron; it also points out one more reason why our faculty is so
interested in collaborating with you and other executives as the company
moves into this new space.

I would like to call Greg Whalley after the 4th of July weekend to establish
contact and begin a dialogue regarding his interest in joining our efforts
as a Corporate Partner. Will you please provide me contact information?

Please let me know if there is any additional information or material you
will need prior to your meeting with Jeff Skilling.  We are anxious to learn
how he responds to your suggestions.

Thanks again for all that you are doing.  Hope you have a great 4th of
July!!

TOM

Vince,

Two items.  Unless you have an objection, I plan to ship the paper on to
Don Chew at the journal this morning.  We can still work on the article but
he needs something to begin the editing process.

Second, in the same issue as our paper will appear the transcript of a
roundtable discussion involving Sheridan titman, John McCormack (Stern
stewart), Ron Erd (Southern Energy), Jeff Sandifer (president of sandifer
capital--$700 million undermanagement), and Gene Humphries.  Attached you
will find a section THAT WILL NOT BE IN THE FINAL DOCUMENT, but that I
thought you might like to read in light of our own discussions over the
course of writing this paper.

Have a great day.

Ashley,

I agree with you. Two trips are the best solution, unless of course Shmuel 
rearranges
the speaker list and the 16th will work for the presentation as well. 

Coordinating so many different events is never easy. Thanks for your
patience.

Vince,

Actually, the General Presentation that I have scheduled for the Faculty Club 
(a dining/meeting room) on campus is set for 7:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. on Monday 
the 16th.    I can attempt to change the presentation date again, however I 
feel that it would be very unlikely that we are able to get another facility 
that is near campus.  At this point it may be better to plan on making two 
seperate trips so that we are able to handle both events.  Maybe we could 
combine another presentation in during the same visit.  What do you think?

Shmuel,

Let's see if we can either rearrange the seminar speakers
or change the date of our visit to the campus. Ashley Baxter, our coordinator 
is very efficient and
got a faculty room for a presentation on Monday morning on the 16th.

Dear Vince. I spoke too soon. Apparently the seminar slot on the 16 was
already filled. I will see if I can switch the speaker for that week to the
following week. In any case we are on for dinner on the 16.

Vince and Christie,

Greetings.  I am writing because I need a break out of names for the Tiger 
Team group 1 and 3.  I understand Tiger Team group 2 has decided not to be a 
part of Enron and I also need to know who those students are.  I have a 
listing of all the tiger team members but they are listed alphabetically so 
that does not help me with my quest.  We are trying to firm up the details 
and get offers out to the correct people for summer associate positions in 
Vince's department.

Regards,

Kristin

Vince,

Thank you so much for forwarding this information to me as well as making 
some initial contacts on campus!  I was wondering if you could provide a two 
hour time slot in the next two weeks for the Cal Berkeley Planning Session 
with the entire campus team here in the office?  I would like to get the 
entire team together prior to the Career Fair on the 8th so that we can go 
over the strategy, dates on campus, and roles/responsibilities.  

Also, I know that you mentioned that the first couple of weeks in October 
would be the best to target for the General Information Session.  How does 
the week of October 9th look for you?  Is there a certain day that works the 
best?  I would like to work with your schedule to see if we can come up with 
a date in that timeframe.

Thanks again for your help!
Ashley

 I have given your email to Richard Bryant, who is the director of the comp. 
fin. program at CMU.  No doubt he will be in touch.  Here's a link:  
http://www.gsia.cmu.edu/afs/andrew/gsia/www/mscf/mscfindex.html

 I feel that I should mention something: from my experience at CMU, there are 
three types of students.  Those that work very very hard and are basically 
ethical; those that cheat their way through school, and the sharks.  It is 
very difficult to distinguish between the groups when interviewing.  In my 
class of about 30 students, there were three sharks, about six or seven hard 
workers, and then there was everyone else.  Anyway, for what its worth!

Frank,

Great idea. I think it will be an opportunity to brainstorm about the problem.

Vince,
Now that's an interesting idea -- the problem is that I don't really HAVE any
work yet, as I am just now beginning!  But yes, why don't I put a talk 
together
as to what I'm thinking about, why it's important, why existing methods may be
inadequate, and how I think econometricians can contribute.  Does that sound
ok?

Mark!

Please review the attached article and forward your comments/authorization 
for its use to John Martin at Baylor, copying me and Vince.

John and Vince,

I have a few simple comments:

1. Please use "Enron Corp." [rather than "Enron Corporation"]

2.  page 3: as of yesterday, Fortune Magazine named Enron "most innovative" 
for the SIXTH year in a row

3.  page 5:  2nd paragraph:  regarding the "gas bank" concept--I believe when 
Jeff first introduced it, it fell flat. I think John pick's that up (and 
Enron's subsequent recovery of a version of the concept on p.6), but it's 
probably accurate to mention that at first, it didn't go over.

4.  page 13: re: Cindy Olson's comment on a possible 5 X difference between  
a "satisfactory" and "superior" VP--the difference referred to is probably 
the "bonus" rather than "compensation" (which , to me, is generally means 
base salary); also, it varies for each review period, as comparative 
performance might vary;   further, we might want to run that quote by Cindy 
just to make sure she's OK with it's publication (she might have no problem 
with it whatsoever, but I know for other articles, she's been more reluctant 
to provide that kind of  statistic).

5.  page 17 (after Annual report quote): I suggest changing "Enron's 
wholesale business... provides" to "...businesses..provide";  also, rather 
than "Enron Wholesale" we might want to define this by the term Enron uses: 
"Enron Wholesale Services"

6.  page 18: 2nd paragraph: the tense switching from past to present is 
technically correct if read carefully , but seems awkward when reading it

7.  page 19: effective February, Jeff Skilling is "CEO".

...that's my 2-cents worth!!   I think the article is great...even 
interesting (ha!)...even to non-MBA's like me!!

Thanks!

--Christie.

Mark,

I am sending you the final (?) draft of the paper by John Martin
on Enron's transformation. John Martin is a prof from Baylor who visited us 
a few weeks ago.

Can you take a look at the paper and bless it. I haven't read this last 
version
of the paper yet and I will go through it on weekend.

Vince

Vince,

Attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together.  Our timetable
is very short as we need an "approved by Enron" version of the paper to Don
by next Wednesday.  Don has already made editorial changes for us and may
make some additional "writing style" changes but he doesn't change the
content.

I'll give you a call later today to alert you to the e-mail.

take care,

john

p.s. i had a nice conversation with steve.  sounds like he's landed a
pretty good contract with Wiley.

Hi Jeff!

I know you received the information below.  Additionally, I have 2 people 
from Broadband Services meeting us there Friday (one is Traci Warner who set 
up the Rice U deal). Further, I'll be meeting with Amy Briggs regarding the 
Entrepeneurship Conference Nov 30th and Dec 1st.  I've already spoken with 
her and Tom Piazze and both independently confirmed as you suspected that we 
committed to sponsor at the $10,000 level.  This entitles us to Banners, 
panels, posters, and most importantly, a Keynote address.  I'll discuss the 
keynote address with her but would appreciate your thoughts in advance as to 
how you'd like to see the Keynote speech executed (suggestions for topics, 
proposed speaking candidates, when in the conference you'd like to see 
Enron's speech, etc). I'll review the trip with you when we return.

Thanks Jeff!

Greetings, MIT Recruiting Team!

Each of you has been chosen to represent Enron for our Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at MIT University.  As part of the team, you will be challenged with 
choosing the best candidates from Sloan's Graduate School to join our 
Associate Program.

Currently, we are planning to have a brief team meeting in order to make 
introductions, inform you about the Associate Program, and discuss the fall 
recruiting calendar.  To that end, please contact me with any questions or 
comments you may have.

The team meeting date is set for September 1st at 10am in room 11C2.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

It's a great pleasure to have you visiting us and a great honor to have
dinner with you. I'd like to thank you for your wonderful presentation. It's
the most interesting topic we had so far. This is not just my personal
opinion, all my classmates I talked to agree with me.  I like Enron's style
and culture and I think it played a big role in Enron's success. I look
forward to discuss career opportunities at Enron during your on-campus
interview session.

Bernard,

I am forwarding your message to my assistant and she will mail you a reprint.
I would be glad to take a look at your dissertation. Is it available as a 
publication, working paper?

Hello Vince,

My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les Clewlow,
who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at Warwick
Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump
Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
come to my attention :

"The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US
POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.

and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present
and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.

Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at University
of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK,
where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach
(spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.

Thanks in advancve

Bernard Murphy

 We are very interested in the Comp. Fin. students, and would tentatively 
like to interview them in December, probably the week of the 11th, and around 
the same time that we come to interview the MBA's.  

 I'm uncertain as to the proper path forward.  Could you provide some details?

Hi Vince!

I'll call you Monday to further discuss this!  I'll be heading to Atlanta for 
a Forbes conference and meeting at Emory, but will call you at my first 
opportunity!

Thanks for the information about the meeting with Bob!

Hi Carrie,

It was great meeting with you and Dean Whitaker again last Friday, as well as 
Mr. Westbrook.
 As we discussed,  I have submitted the Action Learning Program materials to 
Vince Kaminski, our managing director of Risk analysis and Corporate 
Research.  I'll be following up with him, and his recommendations for project 
proposals next week.
  Also, I've discussed with our University Affairs team setting up the 
faculty tours--we're ready when you are!!  The sooner the better--I'd love to 
get these in pretty immediately, and in any event, before the reception at 
the end of the month.  I"ll have Cindy Derecskey in my group eMail you--she 
is prepared to set these tours up.  

I look forward to continuing to develop the multiple potential dynamics of 
the Enron-Rice relationship!

Thanks!

--Christie.

ps:  Thanks so much for the Crystal Rice Owl--my participation as a judge in 
the Rice Invitational Case Competition was my pleasure indeed!

Christie,

I enjoyed visiting with you last week at the Jones School.  Thanks for
taking time to come see us.  I wanted to follow up with you regarding the
Action Learning Project program and Enron tour.  We hope to have Enron as
part of the program in 2001.  Please let me know how I can help make this
happen.  I look for the program to be full before the deadline of December
1st.  Also, I am happy to help organize a group to tour Enron.  If you were
to participate in the ALP program, January/February might be a good time to
put something together with key faculty and the ALP team.  Let me know your
thoughts.

Again, many thanks for your continued support of the Jones School.  I look
forward to hearing from you soon.

Vince and Jeff...the following is "FYI"...my assistant is working on the 
flight arrangements.  Also, "FYI", the DoubleTree and other downtown hotels  
were entirely, or mostly, sold out, but my assistant found a good rate at the 
Warwick [$115] by Herman Park, where everyone will be 'housed' in the same 
location for one night--I also think this location is a good 'Houston-sell'.

Dinner is scheduled for 7 Thursday evening at Churrasco's , and my group is 
arranging the "TourEnron"--breaking this group into 2.  [FYI: the Energy Club 
from SMU (another Skilling Alma mater) had long ago also schedule a tour that 
day, so we'll have 19 from SMU and 18 from Wharton on the same day...but so 
far, all seems manageable.]

As "Tour times" are set, and business unit interview requests are received 
from the students, I'll keep you posted.  
Thanks!

Christie,

I wanted to update you on my schedule for December as you are working to
arrange some time for Vince and I to visit with the Enron leadership group.
 We had talked about the first week in December and that is good for me
through Wednesday Dec 6th.  I will be at a conference at Harvard on the 7th
and 8th.  However, the next couple of weeks are also possibilities if we
can squeeze in some time.

Thanks

Subject: MIT Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar

Vince,

I have received a call from MIT asking if Enron would be interested in 
sponsoring a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar.

This means that Enron would propose a problem that would have its solution 
developed by students in the Financial Engineering Track. These students 
would present the findings in the end. 

I think that Enron has already sponsored a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar. 
I remember something about Real Options at the time I was at school.

Please, let me know if Enron has the interest, specifically the Research. 

Talking here at the Weather Desk, Mark Tawney expressed interest. If you 
agree, we (the Weather Desk) could co-sponsor this Pro-Seminar with the 
Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to Weather 
Trading.

Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.

Thanks,

Claudio

Let's see if we can either rearrange the seminar speakers
or change the date of our visit to the campus. Ashley Baxter, our coordinator

Dear Vince. I spoke too soon. Apparently the seminar slot on the 16 was

Hi Greg!

Here is the information regarding the Dec 13th event at Wharton.  Wharton is 
beside itself with excitement at your acceptance, and communicated that with 
Jeff Skilling at his visit there this past Thursday.  

They're also very interested in discussing their WeBI program with you and 
would like to arrange to do that the day of your evening presentation, or 
perhaps the following day, whichever suits your schedule.  This was also 
discussed with Jeff Skilling--he is clearly interested in the program, but 
will be especially looking to your input, along with that of Vince Kaminski, 
Jeff Shankman and me, in determining Enron's decision to participate.  As I 
mentioned previously, Vince, Jeff and I think Enron's involcvement with WeBI 
holds very positive potential. Financially, it involves a contribution of 
$250,000 for 4 years.

Please see the request for your "Bio" and desired inclusion of program 
materials, as well as the contact at Wharton, toward the end of the message 
below.

Let me know by eMail or voice mail (3-6117) how University Affairs can 
further these efforts.

Thanks!

--Christie.

Christie,

We are delighted that Greg Whalley, CEO of Enron Bandwidth Business, has 
agreed to be our featured dinner speaker at the upcoming Wharton Seminars for 
Business Journalists on Wednesday, December 13, 2000.

Per instructions from Tom Piazze, I've attached some information regarding 
our Seminars for Business Journalists, now in its 32nd year 
http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/media/journalists/. As I'd mentioned in our 
conversation a few weeks ago, we have a leader from business or government 
speak each year at our Sponsor's Dinner, which is attended by all of the 
business journalists (about 50) and representatives from our corporate 
sponsors (lists attached below). Our last 3 speakers were Mark Walsh, 
chairman of Vertical Net; Jason Olim, CEO of CDNow; and Tom Siebel, CEO of 
Siebel Systems.

About 80-90 people are expected to attend this year's event. Cocktails, 
dinner and Mr. Whalley's presentation will be held on Wednesday, Dec. 13, 
from 6:00 to 9 p.m. in Wharton's Steinberg Conference Center, 38th & Spruce 
Streets, on the University of Pennsylvania campus.

As Tom may have mentioned, this audience likes to hear about interesting 
industry trends, or something companies are doing that is leading edge, and 
hasn't really hit the mainstream. Past experience has shown that "canned" 
corporate presentations do not go over so well with this group. However, you 
are certainly welcome to provide literature to the audience or other 
materials that may be appropriate. I would like to have a conversation with 
you about your thoughts on a specific topic as we get closer to the event.

In the meantime, we would like to have Mr. Whalley's bio and any other 
information you'd like us to include in the course materials for the 
journalists. Please try to keep this to about 2-3 pages, given all of the 
other material they'll have in their binders.

You may contact me or my colleague, Joanne Spigonardo, with any questions. 
Joanne is handling the logistics for the event, so please direct those types 
of questions directly to her. She's at 215573-8599.

Thanks again, and I hope you can join us on the 13th.

Best regards,

Mike

Hello everyone,

I wanted to get a message out to each of you to update you on the February
23 conference plans.  The conference promises to provide an exciting
opportunity to share the ideas of a diverse group of academic and industry
professionals on a topic that is dear to all our hearts, the future of
business education in the new economy.  I will be sharing updates and
information with you over the weeks to come but thought it might be useful
to start before the holidays.

I am attaching the most recent "description of the program of events" which
remains somewhat fluid as we develop it.  However, there are some new
developments that you will find interesting.  First, I have arranged for
"filming" of the event by our local public TV station and we will be
working toward the development of the best product possible out of the
sessions.  Second, David Palumbo (Human Code--an internet content
provider-http://www.humancode.com/index2.htm- now owned by Sapient) will
join us.  David is very knowledgable about both educational issues (he
served on the faculty of the University of Houston for 10 years before
joining Human Code).  He has some very interesting insights to offer on the
future of higher education having now worked from the industry side of the
equation).  Finally, I am currently reading a couple of books that you may
find interesting (Telecosm and The New Barbarian Manifesto).  I'm sure
there are many more interesting sources of information that you are each
aware of and it would be helpful if we all began sharing our notes.

Finally, let me suggest that each of you begin thinking about the issue(s)
that you feel most comfortable commenting upon and phrasing "lead in"
questions for me.  I would like to build a list of such questions to
circulate among all so that we begin to get a feel for the range of topics
we will encounter in the discussion and begin to formulate our individual
opinions.

I hope that this note finds you all anticipating a wonderful holiday season
and thank you for participating in this inaugural "think tank" conference
on the future of business education.

Sincerely yours,


John

Don,

Attached is my latest effort.  It entailed fairly drastic "restructuring
and reorganization" of the earlier draft.  My revision effort has been
directed at improving the focus of the paper.  The new story is the following:

1.  Enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid-eighties.
2.  Economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic
reorganization of the company almost immediately.  The result was the
creation of a new, unregulated energy trading operation.  The strategy of
the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the
deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time (mid-eighties until
now).
3.  The business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of
a "gas bank".  The analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult
problem to Enron's management in that there was no source of liquidity to
the market from a central bank authority.  As a consequence Enron had to
develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures.
4.  Another consequence of the new business model was that it required a
different set of employee skills and talents.  Specifically, it required
were bright, energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying
entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses.  Furthermore, a
new, flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision
making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market
conditions.  To monitor and manage this new "empowered" labor force
required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures.
5.  Three primary tools of personnel management were adopted:  (i) measure
performance semi-annually, (ii) tie compensation closely to performance,
and (iii) allow personnel free movement within Enron to seek out the best
opportunities.
6.  Other attributes of the Enron model include consideration for asset
optionality, recognition of the value of networks in adding value to
trading platforms, and the use of mark-to-market accounting for business
transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions.

If my "story line" sounds better than the draft I have attached its because
its the last thing I've written.  At any rate I look forward to hearing
your comments and to getting this wrapped up.

Thanks and i look forward to seeing you in February.

John

Hi Vince,

I promised to get back to you on the part-time work issue. Sorry for the
delay, I got back to Austin only last week. I talked to Ehud about this and
he is OK with it. Just wanted to let you know.

Vince --

Please feel free to also call Jeff Dasovich (415-782-7822) in our San 
Fransisco office.  He has been very involved in the California market 
discussions and presented before FERC during their field hearings.  He knows 
the profs you are meeting with and has some great insights into our positions.

Jeff also attended Berkeley as an undergrad and is now attending their 
B-school in the evenings.

Thanks.

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.


Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Shmuel S. Oren, Professor

Vince,

I have received a call from MIT asking if Enron would be interested in 
sponsoring a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar.

This means that Enron would propose a problem that would have its solution 
developed by students in the Financial Engineering Track. These students 
would present the findings in the end. 

I think that Enron has already sponsored a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar. 
I remember something about Real Options at the time I was at school.

Please, let me know if Enron has the interest, specifically the Research. 

Talking here at the Weather Desk, Mark Tawney expressed interest. If you 
agree, we (the Weather Desk) could co-sponsor this Pro-Seminar with the 
Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to Weather 
Trading.

Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.

Thanks,

Claudio

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate 
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Vince

Dear Vince, Christie and Vasant:

Thank you for the presentation to the Enron Tiger Team.  It was most
informative and well received by the students. This is an exciting project
and the students are enthusuastic and anxious to begin.  Many thanks, also,
for hosting the dinner at the Palladium.  It was a wonderful opportunity to
get to know more about the project, as well the Enron representatives and
the students.

Listed below is the contact information with team contacts identified.
I will send you the teams project preferences as soon as I recieve them from
all the students.

It may be a good idea to contact the students before they leave for vacation
(15-22 Dec) to see who is interested in a trip to Houston in January for
planning purposes.  They will return to campus Jan. 16.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist from this end.

Again, thank you for your support of the Wharton School and of the Tiger
Team Project 2001.

Dear Vince, Jim, George, David and Vasant:

Neil Doherty, Paul Kleindorfer and I very much enjoyed our discussion last 
Wednesday at Wharton  with you on future joint research  with Enron over the 
coming year. In particular, we see the whole area of capital management and 
catastrophic risk as a fruitful area for foint collaboration. I am sharing 
this message with Louis Thomas and Keith Weigelt who direct the FAP MBA 
program in the hopes that we can find a team to work with us on these issues 
next semester.

Attached is a revised version of our paper on "Evaluating Risk Bearing, 
Mitigation and Risk Transfer Using Exceedance Probability Curves: Project 
Update".   We would greatly appreciate you and your colleagues looking at the 
section on "Cat Bonds Covering Multiple Risks" (pp. 15-19) to see whether our 
example and conclusions make sense to you. We look forward to working with 
your team at Enron   regarding ways that we can build on these preliminary 
findings to make cat bonds for weather risks  more attractive.

Best wishes for the holiday.

Hi Keith!

Thanks so much for your additional thoughts, which I will definitely pass on 
to our business units.

As for your nephew, please have him send his resume to me.  I'll be happy to 
see what I can do.

Again, on behalf of Enron and everyone involved in the project, especially 
Vince and I and Ken Parkhill, we had a great and informative experience with 
the entire Tiger Project.

Best regards!

--Christie.

Christie;

I wanted to send a short note to express my thanks to Enron, and give some
additional thoughts about the Enron presentation.  Both students and staff
enjoyed our interaction with Enron.  We hope Enron got as much from the
project as we did.

I also had some additional thoughts about EnronOnline.

- During the presentation, the students referred to a market's "critical
mass".  However, we never defined what we meant by that.  We had several
discussions on this topic.  I think the best way for Enron to think about
this is in terms of the psychology of traders.  Critical mass gives a market
liquidity.  Traders seem to think about liquidity in terms of breadth (how
many products are being traded) and depth (the number of bids and offers).
Our thoughts were that when a trader pulls up a screen, he (or she) wants to
see bids, offers, and trades occurring.  So a simple (and cheap) metric that
Enron could use to determine whether rivals are approaching critical mass is
simply to pull up screens and see if trades are occurring, and how quickly.
Traders will generally not use a trading platform that lacks "action".

- In terms of New Power, I feel it is extremely important that your managers
create an identity for the company.  Luckily no rival has done this (though
Green Energy is closer than most).  The company that can communicate a
simple and powerful message will create a competitive advantage for itself.
I believe you can differentiate yourself in this market (though you are
selling a commodity).  Since you are essentially selling service,
differentiation is always possible.

On a final note, I wanted to ask a favor.  My nephew recently graduate from
Michigan State University with a degree in business.  I brought him to
Wharton to work on the Tiger Projects.  This was because I knew he could add
value, and because I thought he needed more experience in some strategy
areas.  He served as project coordinator and worked on several projects
(including Enron).  I was hoping I could get him an interview at Enron since
he expressed interest in your company.  Any help you could offer is
appreciated.

Thanks again for making the experience memorable to the students.

Keith

I received this email some time ago, and may not have forward it to you.  I 
apologize for any oversight on my part.  I'll also forward the email that I 
sent as a response.

This, coupled with the information from Sally Gould, should get the Comp. 
Fin. interview process started.

We are excited that you want to interview the Comp finance students.

Do you want to do it in Dec. or before?  Let me know what best suits you.
Since there are only 16 individuals in the Pittsburgh area... we should be
able to accomodate you...Would you want one or two schedules..?

  What is the formal protocol in such matters?

What program is Vince interested in having a satellite program?  When he was
here he seemed less intererted in Comp finance and more interested in
E-commerce.

I sent a note to Michael Shamos and Tridas discussing this.

Let me know which program and I will see if we can work anything out?

I spoke with Larry Gagliardi on the Crude/Refinery Products desk this morning 
and he agreed to talk with you after 12:30 today or after 2:30 any other 
weekday.  He is very familiar with the other platforms and should be a great 
resource.  Larry suggested that you surf EOL to find names of power and/or 
natural gas traders, and call them up.  Please let me know if you have 
difficulty finding/contacting folks this way and I will see if I can help.

Larry's office number is 713-853-0543, and his email is

good luck

Vince,

I shipped you the paper along with my note to Don.  However, I wanted to
share with you what I feel are the remaining "to dos".  Specifically,

1.  We need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original
transformation of Enron.  Specifically, the fallout from deregulation (take
or pay contract defaults, etc.), the impact of the losses from the oil
trading operation, the nationalization of the Peruvian pipeline, and the
leveraging up to fend off the Carl Ichan takeover attempt.

2.  We need to complete/beef up the network strategy section.

3.  Finally, the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to
"hammer home" the basic principles underlying the transformation.

What do you think?

Hope you have a great weekend.

John

David,

Here are the reviews of the UT Energy Finance program that  you requested:


>From Jennifer Martinez  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of=20
1998):

The Energy Finance Program 2 years ago was very good, especially considerin=
g=20
it was the first year of the program.  There were a lot of guest speakers=
=20
from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge abou=
t=20
the energy industry through case studies, lectures, etc.  Basically, we=20
learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance=
=20
classes, but all the cases and examples were energy-related.  The professor=
s=20
were good for the most part but didn't have a great deal of practical=20
industry experience.  If I had to guess the reason for decreased=20
participation in the program, I would probably say it is the professors. =
=20
Ronn and Titman are great but known as being very technical and=20
quantitative.  Some students prefer less technical professors and classes=
=20
that aren't limiting to the energy industry.  Also, the fact that the class=
=20
meets for 3 hours twice a week may not be so appealing.  Other than those=
=20
things, I can't imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment.  I=20
especially don't understand why every single person didn't drop for Enron. =
 I=20
wonder if it has something to do with international status.???=20

>From John Massey  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):

Bottom Line -

UT Business Schools is great - Investment Fund - Best Activity available to=
=20
students
Energy Finance program - Fairly Weak -
It was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a=
=20
weak finance appendage -
The Finance teacher was pathetic - both a poor teacher, ignorant about=20
industry specific analysis, devoid of industry experience, rude to outside=

lectures (from industry)
Keith Brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small=
=20
portion of the class time -

Way to make Better:
Get teachers with practical industry experience -
Make it a seminar Class - Focus on Case studies, lectures - given by people=

Promote the class within the business school - I felt like UT did a poor jo=

>From Ross Mesquita  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998):

To be honest, a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific.  =
=20
When energy applications were presented, it seemed more like general financ=
e=20
questions were reworded to include energy lingo.  We had some very good=20
speakers, but for the most part, I did not feel like the 6 hours of class h=
ad=20
enough energy focus.  I assumed that this would get better as the program=
=20
progressed.

One reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that Energy=20
Finance is a very specific focus.  I would have probably not enrolled in th=
e=20
Energy Finance program had it been available in my first year.  I did not=
=20
know enough about energy at that time and I had returned to B-school to=20
consider several career options -- i.e., investment banking, corporate=20
finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, etc.  As a new MBA student, I would n=
ot=20
want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies. =20

Here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many MBAs--

My interest in Enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa. =

>From Billy Braddock   (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998=
):

I was a participant in the inaugural Energy Finance program in the Fall of=
=20
1998.  The primary positives to the class revolved around outside=20
panels/instruction.  For example, Enron sent representatives on 2 separate=
=20
occasions to discuss particular topics (Vince Kaminski and Gary Hickerson).=
 =20
Other notable speakers were Jeff Sandefer (independent business consultant=
=20
and E&P professional), the Beacon Group, and Encap Investments.  Another go=
od=20
speaker was a professor from UT's school of engineering.  He brought a good=
=20
perspective as to the "basics" of the energy business.

The class was structured via a team-based instruction approach, with 3=20
professors team-teaching a 6-hour credit course.  None of the 3 professors=
=20
had any product knowledge of the energy business.  Of the 3 professors, 2=
=20
were research focussed/tenured with little credibility in "teaching."  One =
of=20
the professors primary focus of research was fixed income, while the other =
2=20
were investments and corporate finance, respectively. =20

As is the case for UT's finance program in general, and energy finance in=
=20
particular, UT is in dire need of teaching professors (as opposed to resear=
ch=20
professors) that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples=
=20
and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a=
=20
finance background.  Particular to the energy program, UT needs to have mor=
e=20
instruction from energy professionals (such as the instructors used for=20
Enron's internal learning programs (ie. Derivatives classes, etc.).

>From Bryan Williams  (MBA class of 1999, Energy Finance taken fall of 1998)=
:

I participated in the first Energy Finance class offered in Fall of 1998, a=
t=20
the University of Texas. =20

The curriculum was understandably =01&rough around the edges=018 as 1998 wa=
s the=20
first year the Energy Finance course was offered.  However, the instruction=
=20
also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak=
=20
of (The 6-credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors).=
=20

Two of the three professors have co-authored textbooks, and the third=20
professor=01,s claim to fame is fixed income.  As a group, the three profes=
sors=20
are research-heavy (as opposed to industry focused), and the team-teaching=
=20
format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for=
=20
the success of the class. =20

That said, the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside=
=20
speakers.  Among them: Vince=20
Kaminski & Gary Hickerson, both of Enron.  They also dedicated one class=20
period to a video conference call with the Beacon Group, an energy consulti=
ng=20
group that I believe was recently acquired by Goldman.
Jeff Sandefer, an independent businessman, an entreprenuership instructor,=
=20
and one of the foremost experts in the E&P sector, also spoke to the class.=
 =20
Jeff was joined by some of the executives from Houston-based Encap.

The woes of the Energy Finance could be easily remedied by injecting some=
=20
instruction from someone from industry.    The class is too=20
academic/theoretical with too few relevant examples excerpted from the ener=
gy=20
sector.=20

The instructors Enron uses for the Derivatives courses taught internally ar=

good examples of people who can package very relevant information and=20

- there are some experienced, brand-name professors (e.g. Sheridan Titman)=

which fit in the insudtry need.  However, these two courses are far from=20

>From Charlie Weldon (MBA Class of 2000, Energy Finance taken in fall of 199=
9)

My experience in the Energy Finance program overall was a positive=20
experience.  The most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers=20
brought in during Dr. Titman's portion of the class.  This part of the cour=
se=20
is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of ~10 case=20
classes all focusing on the Energy industry.  Two of the cases were based o=
n=20
Enron, and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate an=
d=20
well thought out.  Value added by the professor was less than from the=20
speakers and cases.

The first eight  weeks of the course covered futures and options.  Nearly a=
ll=20
of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy=20
industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the student's=20
understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market.  The u=
se=20
of options and futures for speculating and/or hedging was stressed on=20
numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power=
=20
plant project.

I believe that the University Energy Finance faculty are trying to=20
continuously make improvements to the program.  However, I do not believe=
=20
that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to=20
improvement.   There is a strong need for more practical based training on=
=20
energy derivatives similar to the course taught by Paradigm here at Enron. =
=20
The focus of the University teachers is quite theoretical, due in large par=
t=20
to their background.  While the theoretical basis is crucial to understandi=
ng=20
the basics, the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective=

Kim,

Yes, the offer is coming. It may take a few days to process it, but you can 
count on it.

Vince:

I did get your phone message about the summer, but I still haven't heard from 
Enron about an offer for summer employment.  I do have other offers with 
other energy companies that I must respond to this week.  Could you let me 
know as soon as possible if an offer will be made to me.

Sincerely,

Vince,

I have made bold face edits to the attached document.  I still have two edits 
to make but am concerned that you were not reading the most recent version.  
Sorry for any confusion but the editor doesn't use the edit function in word 
so I have ended up making edits on new versions of the paper.  

I still haven't made the change regarding the take-or-pay problem (I left 
that paper at home in my briefcase and will make the change tomorrow 
morning).  Also, I haven't added anything regarding the conflict that arose 
over pay for new hires nor have I received the Business Week e-mail from you.

However, if the paper looks ok to Mark Palmer we can make these minor edits 
on the galley pages of the article.  

thanks

john

p.s. i am very disappointed about the scheduling conflict you have on Feb 
23rd.  you will be greatly missed but i certainly understand.

 What do I need to do to move this thing forward?
I suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers.  They only know how 
to stop things, but in a way they play a role in global society.  If it were 
not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a 
chance.

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Vince and John,

I wanted to send you a quick note and once again say thank you for attending 
the Cal Berkeley presentation last week.  I am sorry for the low attendance 
on campus, however I did want to send some refreshing news.  I just received 
the resumes of students who would like to interview with Enron.  There were 
43 resumes submitted for the Technologist position and 46 resumes submitted 
for the Analyst position.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ashley

Just wanted to share the list of "one-page" bios and summary statements
that I have collected to this point.  I have two more yet to come and will
share them ASAP.  Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing
everyone in "sunny/warm Waco" next week.

By the way, Bill Petty has challenged everyone to a 40 minute jog along the
river on Friday morning at 6:45 a.m. so bring your jogging gear.  I also
have heard from very reliable sources that Bennett Stewart is the odds on
favorite to "win the race" (Cynthia leaked the story that he's been in
training now for several months).

I'll also be sending you driving/parking, etc. instructions early next week.

Have a great weekend,

John

Dear Dr. McMullen,

A few weeks ago I received a call from your University
regarding employment opportunities at Enron.

I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a 
candidate):

1. mathematical finance
2. computer programming (C, C++)
3. understanding of the energy markets

I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.

I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential
opportunities for graduates with different profiles.

Please, feel free to call me. My number is 713 853 3848.

Gentlemen:

Attached is a schedule of activities as well as maps and driving
instructions for those who are driving to campus Friday morning.  The dress
for Friday is casual (no ties, sport shirts and jackets if you wish).

For those of you who have asked about Thursday night's dinner please note
that we have pushed it up to 6-8pm at Ninfa's Mexican Restaurant.  At this
point I plan to pick up Bennett S. and Don C. from the Marriott before 6
and will do the same for anyone else (let me know).  The restaurant is in
easy walking distance of the Hilton and Marriott.

Please note the times for your individual interviews/video taping on
Friday.  Some of you are leaving early so we are taping you from 11-12
Friday morning while others are being taped after the program is over.

I'm sure I've forgotten something so you'll probably get more e-mails.
However, this should take care of the primary stuff.  I'm really looking
forward to seeing all of you and to hearing your thoughts in the workshops.

more later,

john

I recommended inviting Duane Seppi and Steven Shreve. I would also invite 
Brian Routledge.
I don't know him but heard many good things about him. Kevin Kindall may have 
other recommendations.

Dear Stinson,

I enjoyed our conversation this morning. I would love to meet with your
people to discuss collaborations that will be of mutual benefit to me
and the students and postdocs and your company. I am available on Mondays,
Wednesdays or Fridays, at just about any time (early mornings or afternoons
best). We'll probably need up to a couple of hours.

Please send me your address to mail you some info.

Best,

Carlos

(Monday and Tuesday).

I shall be glad to make a presentation on energy derivatives markets 
(development of the markets in the US and Europe, valuation difficulties, 
Enron's role
in developing the forward markets for natural gas and electricity).

Please, let me know if this topic would be of interest to you. If this is the
case, I shall follow with a title and an abstract.

By the way, are you free for dinner on Monday?

Vince:  I will send to you later today the information you requested in 
electronic form; in the meantime, please discuss with Jeff Shankman.  He just 
alerted me that he has procured the required funding and that Jeff Skilling 
has agreed to Enron joining the WeBI at the Corporate Partner level. I am to 
call Jeff Shankman later today to discuss.

This is great news for the School and Enron!!  Would not have been possible 
without your persistance and assistance and I thank you for it.

We will discuss more later.

Vince,

Pierre has informed me that (if you can so co-ordinate with Alison Bailey)
you would like to move the recruiting event on campus for Comp Finance to
Nov 3 in order to co-ordinate with Pierre's invitation to speak in the MSCF
Speaker Series the same day.  I contacted our recruiting center about
availability on that date and have forwarded below his response.  Let me
know how else I can help and, again, thanks for your kind words about the
program and you obvious interest in meeting with us.

Enron currently has 8 interview rooms scheduled on December 11, 2000... As
we have 10 interview rooms available to us and as on 11/3 we currently have
nine rooms booked, if Enron wants to move all 8 schedules to 11/3, we
probably will not be able to host them on-campus unless [the firm currently
holding the rooms] moves off (and there is a possibility of that - this is
like a game of dominos).  However, Enron could interview off campus, but
that is not as convenient for the students and it increases the cost for the
employer.  If Enron wants to move only one or two schedules to 11/3 for just
Comp Finance, we would find a way to accomodate them.  Our Recruiting
Coordinator, Sally Gould, will do everything she can to make this work for
Enron.  Please suggest that Enron re-contact her as soon as they know what
their preferences are.  Alison knows how to reach her.

Note: Heather and  Jack have requested to stay in Houston until Sunday

borne).

Donna,

Would you please review this list, add the individual names of "team # 1), 
add any additional faculty, T.A.'s etc, that will be attending, and returnm 
this list to me and my assistant, "Melinda McCarty" who will begin the 
arrangements.  Also, if others would prefer Sunday returns to Phily, on the 
same terms offered Heather  and Jack, please so indicate NO LATER THAN 
Tuesday, Dec. 20.  Please inform Donna, who will then prepare and forward to 
me and my assistant  Melinda(e-mail address above) one complete, confirmed 
list of attendees.  The plan will be to leave Phily on Thurs afternoon, 
arrive late aft Thursday, Dinner at Churrasco's  South America Restaurant 
Thursday evening with me, Vince, Vance, Jeff Shankman, and possibly a few 
others from Enron.

Hotel Thursday evening and ground transportation through return to airport 
will be arranged by Enron.

would like to set up with members from variuous business units 

Return will be scheduled for early Fri evening, except for those electing to 
stay through Sunday.  Again, except for return to airport and airfare, 
expenses beyond Friday afternoon will be borne by each respective student 
(though we encourage you to stay and look around this great city of Houston!).

Thanks Donna, for your immediate assistance with this--Vinve, Vance, Jeff and 
I are excited about the trip!!

I understand that you are the lead recruiter for CMU.  As you know, I am the 
only alum from that school in Enron's Associate Program.  I assume I will be 
joining you for our corporate presentation on 9/13 at 7:30am.  Please let me 
know what I can do to help prepare for this event.  Enron and GSIA are a 
great fit, so I want this recruiting effort to go well.

Are you also giving a talk/lecture to the computational finance students?  If 
so, what time?  Maybe we can schedule a lunch with Duane Seppi.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.

Good morning Mr. Martin,

I would like to introduce myself.  I currently work with Christie Patrick and 
Michael B Rosen in the Enron University Affairs department.

In recent discussions with Christie, she has suggested that I liaise with you 
and our management in preparation for your and Vince Kaminski's case study.  
Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few convenient 
times that work with your schedule.  I will work with our management and do 
my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews that fit with your 
outline.

Initially, I will schedule interviews with: Ken Lay - chairman and CEO, Jeff 
Skilling - president and COO, and Andy Fastow - CFO.  If you feel that you 
may need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to work 
something out the same day, so you don't have to travel back here.  I will 
forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once the 
interviews are scheduled.  Do you anticipate drafting specific questions?  If 
so, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.

I greatly look forward to working with you and I hope that we can touch base 
very soon.

Regards,

Hello all,

I look forward to this meeting.  Since the time Vince and I last spoke, we 
have really gained some traction in this area of improving our relationships 
with universities.  I am going to take the liberty of inviting Mike Rosen to 
the meeting.  Mike has done a great job on several relationship-based special 
projects, and I'd like to hear his thoughts as we develop the angles of this 
initiative.

See you tomorrow,

Mark

Cindy,

Great to hear from you and I look forward to getting our interviews done.  I
am answering this from a hotel in Seattle so I don't have questions for you
at this time but can get them together for you.  I will contact Vince next
week and get a set of questions together for each of the three individuals
you mentioned.  I will have to talk to Vince about others who would be of
interest to interview.  I really appreciate your help in getting this
together and I'll work hard to get everything together for you next week.  I
don't have Vince's e-mail address with me here so I would appreciate your
forwarding this message on to him for me.

Thanks again,

John

Thanks.  Yes it is unfortunate that we were not able to quickly identify

an offer letter for Kim and get it to her immediately.

Also, thanks for agreeing to help out with Stanford.  Hopefully we will get
a few good ones!

It seems that the process lasted too long for some students
and only Kim Whitsel is interested in the internship at this point.

Her resume has been forwarded to you.
I am enclosing it just in case.
Thanks for your help.

Vince:

Thank you to you, Ken and Christie for coming to campus for the Enron Tiger
Team Mid-Project review.  The students are working hard and appreciate your
insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the
Wharton School.

Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me
that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.

I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having
summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately
accepted
positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean
they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize
and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I
think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the
agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview
week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an
added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.

Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel
should proceed.


Thank you,

Shirley,

Unless my flights change, I can call in from my cell phone--what number shall 
I dial?

Thanks!

Hello Vince and Shirley,

Thank you so much for your patience as I tried to shuffle dates and events 
around!  I have some great news.  I was able to secure a room on campus at 
the Faculty Club for the presentation on Monday October 16th at 7:00 - 9:00.  
That should work out perfectly as far as being about to present at the 
seminar from 3:30 - 5:00.  Furthermore, I was able to adjust the resume drop 
dates so that we have through the week of the 16th for students to submit 
their resumes.

I will go into more detail about this tomorrow at the Cal Berkeley Team 
Meeting.  I have put together some booklets to hand out to the team 
tomorrow.  Vince, I have put some time into the agenda for you to welcome the 
team and get everyone excited about Cal recruiting this Fall.  Thank you for 
all of your help!  Please let me know if there is something that you would 
like me to add to the agenda for tomorrow.

Thanks!
Ashley

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

Pierre Ste-Marie tells me he has invited you to visit Carnegie Mellon.  I
would just like to emphasize how much we hope you can arrange a visit.  We
have had the good fortune of attracting outstanding students into our
Master's program in Computational Finance, and I think you will enjoy
meeting them.  Last year Alexander Eydeland visited, and at the conclusion
of the year hired one of the students.  I look forward to meeting you.

Sincerely yours,
Steve Shreve

Hello, Elena:

Thank you very much for your data. I sent an email to FT but had no
response so far. As soon as I got their permission I will let you know.

Have a great day!

Tom,

Thanks for your message.

I shall be glad to attend the meeting (of course a lot may happen between 
now and then and we may have many unexpected developments
in a company as dynamic as Enron).

I want to get back to you at some point with comments on your paper.

Vince

Hello Vince,

A colleague and I are hoping to have a panel discussion on energy
securities for the coming Eastern Finance Association Meetings (April
25-28, 2001 in Charleston, South Carolina).  I was wondering if you or
someone you know at Enron would be interested in participating in such a
meeting.  I realize that you may not be able to plan this far in advance
and would certainly not be offended in the least if you cannot participate.
 We already appreciate you taking time out of your schedule this past
semester to visit LSU.

I hope all is going well and wish you continued success in your ventures,

Tom Arnold

The audience consist of mostly first year graduate students in Industrial
Engineering and Operations Research some doctoral students and faculty. A
short introduction about opportunities for quantitative minded people at
Enron would be good. It would also be good if in your talk you can give some
technical examples for people with a good analytic background but no much of
a financial engineering background. Many of the first year graduate students
go for a masters degree and wonder what they can do with an OR masters
degree.

Dear Drs. Roberts and Benjamin,

Vince Kaminski and I enjoyed and appreciated the opportunity to speak with 
you this morning. Enron is very happy to agree to participate in Stanford's 
GLOBE project (being conducted in partnership with McKinsey & Company).

Attached please find my business card with all of my contact information.

 I look forward to hearing from Dr. Benjamin in the near future to begin 
Enron's involvement.

Thank you!

--Christie.

Vince,

I wanted to email you and let you know how sorry I am that I was not able to 
make your presentation at Carnegie Mellon.  I really was looking forward to 
the trip and the presentation but unfortunately since I have been on the road 
a lot lately things started backing up in the office.  After my meeting on 
Thursday there was no way I would make the 6pm flight and my original flight 
would have put me in Pittsburgh to late for the presentation.  

Anyway, I hope you understand and I am looking forward to working with you in 
December for the interviews on campus.  Maybe once you return you can give me 
a recap of the days events.  In the meantime if you need any assistance 
please do not hesitate to call.  

Thank you,

Kristin Gandy

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Mark,

I am sending you the final (?) draft of the paper by John Martin
on Enron's transformation. John Martin is a prof from Baylor who visited us 
a few weeks ago.

Can you take a look at the paper and bless it. I haven't read this last 
version
of the paper yet and I will go through it on weekend.

Vince,

Attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together.  Our timetable
is very short as we need an "approved by Enron" version of the paper to Don
by next Wednesday.  Don has already made editorial changes for us and may
make some additional "writing style" changes but he doesn't change the
content.

I'll give you a call later today to alert you to the e-mail.

take care,

john

p.s. i had a nice conversation with steve.  sounds like he's landed a
pretty good contract with Wiley.

I'm sure that Baldick would just as soon sell us energy as AE.  Plus we have 
a better handle on market opportunites.  See his e-mail below.

Dear Lance,
 The University is predicting a shortfall due to increased
gas costs of between $30 and $40 million, over the next 1 to 2
years.  For a long time, I have been wanting to explore opportunities for
the
campus to sell energy to Austin Energy when its load is below
peak.  This big shortfall provides an impetus for the university
to want to maximize the value of its plant.

Hi Jaideep!

My first suggestion is that you come to Houston as scheduled (and arranged 
with Wharton nearly 3 weeks ago).  Alternatively, rely on your Tiger 
teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project.  Should 
circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip, please return the 
ticket issued to you.  Should it make sense for you to visit Enron some time 
in the future, we can discuss arrangements at that time.

Hope to see you soon!

--Christie.

Subject: Houston Trip


Hello Christie,

Thank you for organizing the Wharton trip to Enron.  Unfortunately, the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as I'll have to miss over
4 hours of classes, which I cannot afford to do.  I tried changing the time
with Continental and there latest flight leaves at 6PM - which does not work
for me (smack in the middle of my 3 hour class)

Thus the dilemma that I find myself in is the following:

a. Try a different flight as I can make any flight after 7:30PM (however, I
have no control over reservations/budget etc)
b. As it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year, use this ticket to come
some other time

Sorry for this but I just saw the  bookings today.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Jaideep

Dear Vince,

Please find the following description of the program that I would like to
raise additional funding for.  I will follow up today with a phone call to
answer any questions you may have.

As always we appreciate your time and support.

Thanks,
Jozef

The Eastern European students at MIT Sloan School of Management are
preparing an Eastern European week to be held in March 2001.  The one-week
long program will familiarize our classmates with many of the countries
that are going through the post communist transformation. As you well know,
Eastern Europe has a great deal of opportunities for many companies.
Unfortunately, it also presents many obstacles that make most of the
opportunities difficult to capture.

Because we believe that we can help to eliminate some of these obstacles,
we want to bring the Eastern European experience to MIT Sloan School of
Management.  Familiarizing the future business leaders with the countries
is only one step toward reforming Eastern Europe, but we believe it is
worth our time and effort.

During the week, we plan to bring series of lectures addressing the
business environment in Eastern Europe.  We want to emphasize especially
the success stories from Eastern Europe.  Such companies as Enron,
Volkswagen, ExxonMobil, GM, and GE have entered the Eastern European market
and show commitment to stay in it.  In at least one panel discussion with
academic experts and industry participants we hope to let everyone know
that Eastern Europe is a real place for business.

In addition to the educational activities, we are preparing number of
cultural events that will introduce the culture of this area.

The scope of our program depends greatly on the funds we will be able to
raise from our sponsors.  In return, we plan to advertise our sponsors in
every activity we will do.  We will make banners and any other appropriate
advertising as desired by the sponsor.  Should a sponsor be willing to send
a speaker for the panel discussion or to give a speech/lecture we would
appreciate the enrichment to our program.

The advertising will reach nearly 700 Sloan students and faculty.  In
addition, the advertising will reach all newly admitted students, as they
will visit our campus for the AdMIT day (an official program to sell our
school to the admitted students).

Attached below is a list of individuals that will be participating in the 
tiger team event at Enron in Houston on the 18th of January.  Keep these 
people in mind when it comes time to pick candidates to interview for the 
Spring.  Call if you have any questions and I am still looking for Wharton 
Alum who would like to attend the dinner at Churrasco's that same evening.  
Thank you,

Hi Vince,

How are you.  It was really a pleasure meeting you and talking to you at
the Toronto energy derivative conference.  Thank you for speaking with
me about the possibility of visiting your research group.  It will be
great if I could have such opportunity whenever you see your schedule
fits.  I am very much open for the last week of July and early August.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

According to the information that Christie Patrick emailed me the following 
people are assigned to Wharton's Tiger Teams 1 and 3.  These candidates per 
Vince Kaminski's request should receive offers for Summer Associate positions 
located in his Research Group.

Tiger Team #1

1.  Vincent Chen
2.  Mallik Deepa
3.  Jack Rejtman
4.  Kim Whitsel
5.  Tulika Bhalia

6.  Nicholas Levitt - I am uncertain based on the emailed information from 
Christie if this is a student or a TA?  Can either Vince or Christie verify 
this information please.

Tiger Team #3

1.  Clay DeGiacinto
2.  Steve Lessar
3.  Vittal Maheshram
4.  Omar Bassel
5.  Dennis Feerick
6.  Marc "Jason" Cummins

The following candidates interviewed with the regular on campus Wharton team 
on 2/5/01 and were not passed onto the second round interviews.  With that 
information I am not sure if we will offer those candidates positions for the 
summer program?

1.  Kim Whitsel - Team #1
2.  Clay DeGiacinto - Team #3
3.  Gustavo Pallazzi - Team #2
4.  Edson Otani - Team #2

I also have that Heather Thorne is the teaching assistant and Donna Piazze is 
the professor for the project.  Can you also verify that information?

Vince if you would please verify and give me the okay via email then I will 
contact these candidates by phone to inform them they will be receiving an 
offer from Enron.  But before I do anything I want to make sure this 
information is correct and I am not excluding or adding any members that 
should receive an offer.

Thank you,

Kristin Gandy

Subject: Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis

Hi Vince,

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Vasant

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential 
project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights 
on the corn price protection approach.

It seems that the process lasted too long for some students
and only Kim Whitsel is interested in the internship at this point.

Her resume has been forwarded to you.
I am enclosing it just in case.

Vince:

Thank you to you, Ken and Christie for coming to campus for the Enron Tiger
Team Mid-Project review.  The students are working hard and appreciate your
insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the
Wharton School.

Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me
that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.

I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having
summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted
positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean
they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize
and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I
think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the
agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview
week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an
added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.

Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel
should proceed.


Thank you,

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I hope I got your title right. I looked everywhere  for it and I could not 
find it. In one of the numerous discussions I had with  professor Shreve 
about you I remember having heard "head of research"...  probably energy, but 
that I could not recall. Is this ok? Also I would like to have the title of 
the conference, it is useful!  
?
Finnally, there is a request for your e-mail by a  PHD student, Do you allow 
me to provide this info?
?
?
Sincerely,
?

Vince,

I appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the
last.  However, my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon
and I wasn't sure I would get back to this before leaving tomorrow.  The
only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro
plus the addition of "Unused information" at the end of the document.  The
unused stuff is made up of notes I made from Hamel, some news stories,
press releases, and random thoughts.  We probably won't use any of this
stuff but I wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful.

The challenge we face at this stage (and where I can most use your help) is
in documenting Enron's risk management functions in a meaningful way.  This
may be best done through examples or in some other way.  I think that our
audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed
examples (even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don't
interrupt the flow of the article.  If you'll make a pass at what you feel
is appropriate I'll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what
you are doing myself.

Vince, I really am enjoying this learning experience.  You guys make a
wonderful "lab".

Sally and I are driving to Louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then
driving to New Orleans and back to Waco by Saturday.  However, I will check
in my e-mail regularly.

Your friend,

John

the next steps I have laid out a plan of action that should lead us to a

in whatever ways you think appropriate (don't be bashful--I want us to get
this right).

Have a great day.

Friends,

Attached is the "Final" draft of the Harvard Business School case study 
prepared by Harvard Professor Chris Bartlett and his research assistant Meg 
Wozny. [please scroll down to the end of the next message for the attachment] 
.  The content was developed from interviews with most of you.

Please review the case and let me know of any desired 
edits/corrections/comments as soon as possible. [One obvious correction is 
the spelling of Cindy Olson's last name].

We'd like to "sign off" on this within the next 2 or 3 days. Harvard 
professors are excited about teaching this case this coming semester.  In 
fact, Professor Don Sull will be focusing largely on this Enron Case this 
semester, culminating in "Enron Day" at Harvard Business School April 26th, 
featuring Jeff Skilling. Also, Chris and Meg will be in Houston this 
Thursday, Jan. 11th, 'capping off' their work with video interviews with Ken, 
Jeff and Louise, which will help "bring the case to life" for the students 
studying it.

Please forward any edits/corrections/comments to me via E-Mail or via hard 
copy (please deliver to EB 4710, or call me [3-6117] and we'll have it picked 
up).

Thanks  to everyone for all your contributions to this exciting work!

--Christie.

Congratulations!  I don't know how you manage to work full-time at Enron
and study for a PhD at the same time.  Sounds superhuman to me!

The FedEx was marked for Saturday delivery, but in case you haven't
received it yet, I'm enclosing the draft as an attachment.
It would be great if we could get Enron's approval during our visit.  (I
know professors at HBS are interested in teaching that case as soon as it's
available.)

Thanks for all your help, and let me know if you have any questions,
comments, etc.

It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your talk today.

I am planning to graduate with a Ph.D. in May 2001 and would
appreciate hearing about any opportunities in your group at Enron.

Thanking you,
Sincerely,

Hi Vince!

Thanks for the information below!

I spoke with Tom Piazze today.  I'll be meeting with him at 3:30 on the 20th 
to discuss the WeBI contract.  I'll also be meeting with Wharton's broadband 
(technical people) before our meeting with the students.  Further, I hope to 
meet with the people in charge of the Business Plan Competition.

Tom  suggested you might want to call Howard Kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly 
stop in to see him while we are at Wharton.

I'll be getting to Wharton sometime Tuesday; I'll try to get a reservation at 
the Inn at Penn.  I'll then be leaving early Wednesday morning by train to 
New York.

Shall we meet in tha Lobby at the Inn at Penn before going to meet the 
students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6pm-ish)--say, 5:30?  
Please let me know!

Also, we still need to give Wharton an answer as to whether we're interested 
in another $50,000 investment in eFellows.

Thanks Vince!

Have a great wekend!

--Christie.

Vince:
 I would like to personally thank you for spending the day with us at the
MSCF program at Carnegie Mellon.  The time you spent talking to us about
Enron, and the energy industry in general, was very much appreciated.  In
fact, I believe some students who were not previously interested in energy
are now interested because of the things about which you spoke.  I have
signed up for an interview for the Associate program at Enron, and I hope to
speak to you again through involvement in the Associate program.  Thanks
again.


Sincerely,


Kent Garrett

on the 6th of December at 9:00 a.m. We may have to cancel lunch with the

Donna, I had also passed along the resumes of two Reliant Energy Tiger Team
members, David Gershenson and James Iker, who were both interested in
working for Enron this summer. I had spoken to Vince about these candidates
when we were in Houston, and he said he would arrange internships for them
as well.
He should already have copies of their resumes and cover letters. Please let
me know if you have any questions or need clarification.

Thanks!!

Vince,

I certainly understand.  However, we are going to try to move the date up a
week or two to make sure there are no conflicts for anyone.  We've had some
trouble getting our hotel date even this far in advance.  I'll be back in
touch when we get it ironed out.

Vince,
This morning I got a call from Richard Bryant, director of computational 
finance
program at Carnegie Mellon University (the program Kevin and I went through).
He's interested in getting Enron involved with their program designing and
(more critically I guess) campus recruiting effort. I gave him your phone 
number
and email. You can expect to hear something from him soon. 

Best,
Alex

Importance: High


Good morning Mr. Martin,

I would like to introduce myself.  I currently work with Christie Patrick
and Michael B Rosen in the Enron University Affairs department.

In recent discussions with Christie, she has suggested that I liaise with
you and our management in preparation for your and Vince Kaminski's case
study.  Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few
convenient times that work with your schedule.  I will work with our
management and do my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews
that fit with your outline.

Initially, I will schedule interviews with: Ken Lay - chairman and CEO,
Jeff Skilling - president and COO, and Andy Fastow - CFO.  If you feel that
you may need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to
work something out the same day, so you don't have to travel back here.  I
will forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once
the interviews are scheduled.  Do you anticipate drafting specific
questions?  If so, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.

I greatly look forward to working with you and I hope that we can touch
base very soon.

Regards,


Cindy Derecskey

John,

I shall be in Paris and London next week. We can schedule a call sometimes 
next week. I shall ask my assistant to send you my itinerary. A late call 
(Paris time)
would work for me. The time difference is 6 hours. This would mean a call
sometimes around 3 - 4 p.m. our time.

Please, indicate which day works best for you.

Vince,

Good morning.  Unfortunately I'll be in Milwaukee visiting Harley-Davidson
about a book revision project both Thursday and Friday.  How about early
next week.  I appreciate your patience with me.  When you suggested a time
last week I was "unprepared" and embarassed to call and expose my
ignorance.  Since then I have re-read the Enron Gas Services case and have
a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial
sides of the business.  The other theme that I have heard many Enron
speakers use is the "de-regulation" of markets.  This certainly played a
factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business.

If you'll let me know when it's convenient to call next week I'll have some
notes put together.  I'm teaching a class for a colleague on Monday so
anytime after that is great.

Thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip.

John

p.s.  I saw that the Univ of New Orleans has an Energy Finance endowed
chair for a financial economist open.  If you ever decide to move back to
the life of poverty of an academic I would love to recommend you for such a
post.

Good afternoon John,

I hope things are well with you.  I am writing to update you on the status of 
your meetings with Andy Fastow, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.  I have arranged 
the following meeting dates and times with Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, (I am 
still trying to work with Andy Fastow's schedule):

Jeff Skilling
December 4th  
2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Ken Lay
December 4th
3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Also, I will attempt to schedule the meeting with Andy Fastow for December 
4th for convenience - this will also allow us to possibly schedule additional

successful.

Kim,

I spoke with Bill Bradford, VP in Enron's Credit Department, and he offered 
to field your questions regarding Credit.  He will be in the office this 
week.  You can call him at 713-853-3831.  

Regarding Nymex traders, what kind of trader are you interested in?  Larry 
Gagliardi trades Nymex crude products.  Let me know if you need his number 
again, or if you think someone else would be more helpful.

good luck

ken

Could you get us the name of the contact who trades directly with Nymex?

Vince:  Per your request, I am forwarding the electronic version of the WeBI 
proposal. As I mentioned to you yesterday, Jeff Shankman has procured funding 
for Enron to join at the corporate partner level, so you may wish to discuss 
the matter with him prior to circulating this document.  This funding is in 
addition to that which you and Christie have already committed to other 
research and sponsorship activities at the School.

Please let me know if I can be of any further help.  I look forward to seeing 
you again soon.

By the way, I cast my vote on time and with no confusion; let's hope the 
outcome is as we hoped it would be.

Subject: Invitation - Wharton ET Events


Vince hello,

I just wanted to followup up on our meeting at Wharton and let you know
that there are two upcoming events that you may want to attend - or
designate others from Enron to attend.  Both of these events are good
opportunities to "test drive" the Emerging Technologies program and see if
there is an interest in joining our partner group.

SEPTEMBER 8 - WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?

Our next insight-building event will be held at Wharton on Friday,
September 8 and is entitled "What Next On the Internet?"

This is primarily a Wharton faculty event and we will be exploring 3 areas:
1) the New Economics on the Web, 2) Internet, Anywhere, and 3)
Implications for (academic) Research and Education.  Speakers will include
Jay Walker (Priceline.com), David Farber (Chief Technologist at the FCC)
and Mohan Sawhney (Kellog Univ., one of the nation's thought leaders on
e-Commerce), along with several senior Wharton faculty members.

There will be considerable discussion on how the next generation of the
Internet will evolve and the implications for management and management
research.  We are inviting our industry partners to join us at this event,
and participate in the discussion, which should contain some valuable
insights and also provides an opportunity to help set our research agenda.
You are most welcome to participate, or designate a colleague, if you like.

OCTOBER 19&20 - WINNERS & LOSERS IN THE E-COMMERCE SHAKEOUT

This will be a major Impact Conference to explore the coming Internet
shakeout, and apply some of the traditional shakeout measures to E-Commerce
and try to determine what we can expect.  It should be an intriguing day.
If you plan to attend please RSVP early since we are sure to be
"overbooked" for this event.  This is probably the best showcase for our
insight-building activities, if you would like to invite any colleagues
help determine if it makes sense for Enron to become a partner in the ET
Program.

If you'd like to RSVP for you and any colleagues who would like to attend
one or both of the events described above,  send me an email reply and I'll
send you a more detailed agenda and speaker description, etc.

I'll be on vacation the rest of this week but if you have any questions or
comments you can call or email me next week.

best regards,
Michael

Dear Vince / Christie,

Thanks for coming to Philadelphia to present an overview of the projects. We 
enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with 
Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as 
well.

We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and 
additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January 
19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We 
plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are 
considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either
(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to 
serve retail customers, OR
(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas 
for further investments.

However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy 
Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to 
suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; 
so please let us know.

We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but 
here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:

Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is 
in the annual report?
What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?
Who are the customers and how are they acquired?
What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron?
What are the international expansion plans and capabilities?
Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?

If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, 
will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?

After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to 
schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly 
involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in 
the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to 
call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

Regards,
Retail Energy Services Tiger Team

Donna,

Thanks for the restaurant recommendation. I would appreciate if you could 
coordinate
the dinner with the students and the faculty. You can expect 4 persons from 
Enron but the
restaurant should allow for some flexibility, just in case. If the restaurant 
needs a credit card number
or a security deposit, you can refer them to my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw 
at 713 853 5290.

Vince:

I look forward to seeing you and Jeff Shankman next week in regard to the
Enron Tiger Kick-Off meeting scheduled for Wednesday, Dec 6 in Vance Hall
210 from 3:00-5:00pm.

You mentioned possibly wanting to take the group to dinner after the
presentation.  I would like to recommend the Palladium Restaurnat, which is
on Locust Walk here on campus.  You may want to view their website at
www.palladiumrestaurant.com  I think they have a nice menu and can
accomodate large groups.  There are several menus from which to choose, as
well.  Please let me know if you would like for me to set this up for you
and I will notify the students and faculty.

Please let me know if I can assist with your visit in any way.

Regards,
Donna Piazze

Vince:

Just want to confirm our conversation regarding your interest in the Wharton 
Tiger Teams 1& 3 and your intent to hire interested members into the summer 
associate program.  You stated that you could take all members into your 
research group for the summer.  Kristin Gandy is now in the process of 
obtaining from either you or members of your department the names of the 
individuals on teams 1 & 3.  Some of these individuals may have interviewed 
with us during the campus process.  If they did and were turned down by the 
team for a summer position, we will not extend offers to those individuals.  
Otherwise, if you are willing to take the additional Tiger Team Members into 
your group based on the experience you and your staff have had in working 
with these students, then the Associate Program will facilitate those offers.

At mid summer and the end of the summer, these Wharton MBAs' performance will 
be evaluated and cross-calibrated with other summer associates to determine 
whether they receive an offer to join the full-time Associate Program.  
Offers will be given to those summer associate who achieve extremely high 
performance ratings.

As soon as Kristin receives the names of these individuals and determines 
which members did not already interview, she will get out both a verbal and 
offer to them.

As follow-up, Jana Giovannini, Manager of Staffing in Career Development, 
will staff those that accept our offer from this Tiger Team list into your 
group for the summer.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

Jeff:  Good talking with you earlier this week and happy to hear that your 
conversation with Jeff Skilling was such a positive one.  I am looking 
forward to working with you, Vince and Mark Palmer in the near future to put 
in place a comprehensive plan to maximize the Enron/Wharton relationship in a 
number of different areas.  I also know that a number of the faculty will be 
extremely pleased to learn of this news and will be quick to get the ball 
rolling.

As promised, I am forwarding a document outlining all on campus sponsorship 
opportunities, minus the Student Business Plan Competition, for the upcoming 
School year.  Please review and pass it on the Celeste Roberts, for whom I do 
not have an accurate e-mail address.  There are a number of student 
conferences that you may wish to consider participating in as a means for 
getting the Enron name in front of them.  Please don't hesitate to contact me 
with any questions you may have or requests for additional information.

I will also contact the Career Management Office and ask that they call 
Celeste to discuss career orientation panel sessions.  I know that you must 
plan your schedule well in advance and will do my best to facilitate that 
process.

Thanks again for all you are doing to bring our two institutions together.  
It is important and makes a big difference.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

TOM

Tom,

I am sending you the information about our new B2B unit.
I have talked yesterday with Greg Whalley who is heading the new
unit about the E-commerce project at Wharton and recommended that Enron join
this program.

I have sent him this morning a copy of the materials you gave me.

The meeting with Jeff Skilling has been pushed till the 2nd half of July.
I talked to him briefly twice that Jeff Shankman and I want to discuss with
him building a relationship with Wharton. Jeff Shankman is, by the way, a 
great friend of
your institution.

                    COMPANIES & FINANCE: THE AMERICAS: Enron sees bricks and

                    mix reshaping energy market: Purchase of MG only a start 
in building
                    B2B platforms, writes Hillary Durgin:
                    99% match; Financial Times ; 16-Jun-2000 12:00:00 am ; 
604 words
                    By HILLARY DURGIN

                    If Jeffrey Skilling is right, 

                    Enron's acquisition of MG is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Enron's president and
                    chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental 
strategy shift at the
                    Houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant 
"new economy"
                    player across various industrial markets. 

                    The Dollars 446m acquisition last month of MG, the 
UK-based metals trader,
                    is only the first of more than Dollars 1bn in estimated 
new investments the
                    company is targeting. It is seeking vehicles on which to 
build
                    business-to-business (B2B) platforms in sectors such as 
logistics, chemicals,
                    agricultural products and pulp & paper. 

                    Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the company 
developed in
                    natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale 
commodity markets. He
                    argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only 
become the principal
                    B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those 
industries. 

                    As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce 
platform, EnronOnline,
                    which has changed the way the company does business with 
its customers
                    while significantly increasing sales. 

                    The company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural 
gas and power - saw
                    wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 
per cent in the first
                    quarter. 

                    Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar 
energy business into
                    new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the 
competition
                    entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts 
point out Enron has
                    proved it understands markets and how to manage risks 
while becoming the
                    largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of 
gas and power in the
                    US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth. 

                    "It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an 
orderly way," says Ronald
                    Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. "What 
they're doing here is
                    what they've been incredibly successful at doing," he 
adds, noting that Enron
                    posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and 
taxes (ebit) from its
                    wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per 
cent from the
                    previous year. 

                    Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of 
the company's overall
                    income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone 
sees the unit's ebit
                    increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years. 

                    As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is 
standardising
                    contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to 
create markets by
                    entering as a physical player and providing merchant, 
risk management and
                    financial services over the internet. 

                    "We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide 
liquidity and we will
                    provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract," Mr 
Skilling says. "That is an
                    extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B sites, 
they don't do that." 

                    Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will 
triumph over the other,
                    bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal 
depends on two parties
                    hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing, 
price, credit and
                    fulfilment. 

                    Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for 
example, would
                    rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco 
recently purchased a 3
                    per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston- 
based, neutral
                    wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and 
American Electric
                    Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of 
transactions on the
                    site to lend it liquidity. 

                    Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals, 
Enron believes it
                    needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring 
MG, Enron got a
                    stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical 
position. 

                    "It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active 
physical spot market
                    in more markets in the world," says Greg Whalley, chief 
executive officer of
                    Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to 
identify and enter
                    commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other 
markets, Enron will
                    deliver better pricing, price risk management services, 
cross-commodity
                    transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range 
of customers. 

                    Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for 
restructuring an industry. 

                    "If you can take that platform, and you use the 
capabilities the bricks bring to
                    the table, e-commerce the industry and change the 
structure, you're selling for
                    more than a 50 multiple."
