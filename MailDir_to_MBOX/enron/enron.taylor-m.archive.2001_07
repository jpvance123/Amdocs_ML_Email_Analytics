Hey S & S, I think the major changes are that we executed two agreements -- SNL and a Weather Services Agreement -- and i think there may be one other agreement in the works.

Tom -


Here is a quick opinion Sullivan and Cromwell issued regarding the sale of equity interests in a CL company to competitors in the marketplace and the general feeling relating to antitrust issues.  I have also attached a copy of a presentation that I recently gave on the topic for your information.

Let me know if you should need anything further.

Cheryl/Mary,

Please prepare a form of ISDA incorporating the credit terms illustrated on the attached worksheet.  Please note, I would like this to effectively mirror the existing ISDA we have outstanding between ECC and ENMAX Energy Corp.  Additionally pursuant the execution of this new ISDA, I would like to amend the existing ISDA with ENMAX Energy Corp such that the collateral thresholds go to zero after January 31, 2002 giving time for the financial trades that are currently on the books with ENMAX Energy Corp to roll-off (expected roll off date is December 31, 2001). Please call with questions or comments.

TAYLOR, MARK E:
 
Attached below you will find the final Evaluation forms for your direct reports; these forms have been pre-populated with your employees' basic data. If you have already completed your employees' final Evaluations, you may disregard these forms. 
 
When completing the Evaluation, carefully consider employee input, consolidated feedback and your observations of their performance and contribution, and encourage employee participation in the evaluation discussion. For many employees, this will be the only formal opportunity to discuss their performance with their supervisor.  
 
Final Evaluations should be completed and returned to your HR representative by August 17 (July 31 for all those in Business Units reporting to Enron Europe) for employees in job groups below Vice President level. 
 
If you have any questions, please contact your HR representative or the PEP help desk at x34777, option 4.

Calpine

Calpine has the highest priority (with the exception of the work that is currently underway for Sempra).  Let me know what information that you may need from my confirmation team.

i believe the legal owner is Enron North America Corp. (see clause 3.1)
a separate agreement (signed by all parties including ENA) will need to be drafted to introduce a buy-in participant (by copy, Mark, has this been done before?...and if not, I wonder whether you would kindly ask someone in your group to prepare this given that this is a US document governed by Texas law...hope this is okay)

Justin,

When we last met you were going to look at a couple of for things for me, these were:

1 - Who is the legally owner of all residual rights attaching to EOL intangible? and
2 - What documentation is need to introduce a buy in participant to the agreement and then draft such document.

Could you let me know the status of both these items.  FYI - the items are needed for the US tax return (which cannot be filed without them) which is being filed in the next week or so. Accordingly, we need to execute and send to US for inclusion before this deadline - ideally I would like to do early next week.

Thanks for your help on this one.

Elizabeth and Mark,  it may also be useful to look at this suggested alternative.  Again, we do not have any agenda in terms of which is the "right" method, but we are just trying to figure out what works in the bandwidth context.  All thoughts gratefully received.

Subject:	Section 5.4 of the new draft MSA

Cynthia, subject to further amendment this is what we're planning to use instead of the structure in the June 22 draft:

(i)	If an Early Termination Date is designated, the Defaulting Party shall compensate the Non-Defaulting Party for the Loss, if any, caused the Non-Defaulting Party with respect to each Terminated Product.  The amount of a Loss shall be determined by reference to (i) the prices available within [thirty (30)] Business Days after the Early Termination Date in an arm's length transaction for a replacement product, or (ii) the price agreed in a cover transaction effected within [thirty (30)] Business Days after the Early Termination Date.  No actual purchase or sale shall be required in order to determine a Loss.  Any cover transaction shall be effected in a reasonable manner and on the best available terms.  In no event shall the Non-Defaulting Party be required to use its own market position in order to effect a cover transaction.         
(ii)	If the Non-Defaulting Party has suffered Loss, the sum of such Loss shall be payable to the Non-Defaulting Party by the Defaulting Party on the date specified in Section 5.5.  The amount payable by a Party pursuant to this Section 5.4(ii) shall be the "Termination Payment".

"Loss" means an amount equal to the difference between the present value of the Contract Price for the remaining Term and the present value of the cost for a replacement product.  With respect to the Buyer, a Loss shall have occurred if such replacement cost is higher than the Contract Price for the remaining Term.  With respect to the Seller, a Loss shall have occurred if such replacement cost is lower than the Contract Price for the remaining Term.  
This takes the place of the present 5.4(i)-(ii), and the definition of Gain is deleted.

Mark, we are trying to get some information on the Nymex Access Electronic Trading System. It is our understanding that during the day the electronic trading system cannot be used because all prices must be announced on the Trading floor so all members are aware of the prices at the same time. However, Nymex wants to use the Access system to post prices after trading hours. Does EnronOnline have any legal obstacles to overcome if we want to post our prices on Access and/or Nymex post their prices on EnronOnline? Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Mark -

A question came up today about the Password Application and the provision restricting the use of the password to the country in which the company applying for the password is located.  

Sunoco is looking to sign up and has two agents in London who do US trades.  They wanted to know how the provision impacts this trading activity and, if it does prohibit the use of the password in the UK for US trades, is there a way to address this so that these agents can do work for Sunoco.

Please let me know your thoughts when you get a chance.

Thanks.


Mark

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures").  These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures.  The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department.  Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp 
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures.  If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message.  The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number.  If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939.

some convenient date in Sept.

Apologies for my silence.  I need to check with Mark H. and make sure he is
still on board but I think it is a good idea and would suggest we try and
schedule something for early September.

Mary, the file will be ready for your review, as Keegan and I are completed the second final revisions.  Please let me know if you would like to review it today.

Since you were unable to get this file to me timely prior to my vacation as requested, I have asked that Mark Taylor sit with you and review the file to get it out this week.  Please coordinate with Mark for a time when you can review it with him.  I spoke with Brian Loubert regarding the acceptance countersignatures of the Enron guaranty and he will look into it and contact Panus.  Thanks.

Mark -

I've left messages over the past month for several people in Legal, but have received no response; hence this message to you in hopes you can direct me to who I should be talking to.

I believe I'm listed as an officer on various Enron companies, including EPMI, for which I had to be fingerprinted for some type of California regulatory requirements.  Given the level of legal conflict etc. in California, and simply because it seems reasonable that I should understand if I have any exposure by being named an officer, I'd like to discuss it with one of our lawyers.  I've heard of D&O insurance, but really don't know what exactly that's for, whether I'm covered, and why I might even need it.

Of course this isn't something that keeps me up at night, but I would like to understand the significance and potential exposure, if any, of being named an officer of these subsidiaries.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

Frank - 
 
Please see the attached article from Reuters below. I believe I'm listed as an officer on various Enron companies, including EPMI, for which I had to be fingerprinted for some type of California regulatory requirements.  Given the level of legal conflict etc. in California, and simply because it seems reasonable that I should understand if I have any exposure (financial or criminal as noted in the article) by being named an officer, I'd like to discuss it with one of our lawyers.  I've heard of D&O insurance, but really don't know what exactly that's for, whether I'm covered, and what it does cover, etc..
 
I've left messages over the past month for several people in Legal, but have received no response; hence this message to you in hopes you can direct me to whom I should be talking to.
 
I believe I'm listed as an officer on various Enron companies, including Enron Power Marketing Inc. (EPMI), for which I had to be fingerprinted for some type of California regulatory requirements.  Given the level of legal conflict etc. in California, and simply because it seems reasonable that I should understand if I have any exposure by being named an officer, I'd like to discuss it with one of our lawyers.  I've heard of D&O insurance, but really don't know what exactly that's for, whether I'm covered, and why I might even need it.
 
Another thing I'd like to know is who else at Enron is listed as an officer of EPMI.  And also, Sara Shackleton discovered last week that the Enron BOD did not actually approve me being designated as a RAC officer, so I'm wondering if the slate of officers for EPMI that was submitted to California for the regulatory requirements is invalid.  Evidently the change from Ted Murphy to me was overlooked in the paperwork approved by the BOD meeting, and the plan is to ratify it retrospectively in this next BOD meeting. 
 
This isn't something that keeps me up at night, but it is of concern to my husband, especially since I am unable to explain the significance and potential exposure, if any, of being named an officer of these subsidiaries.
 
 
Thanks for your help,
 
Cassandra.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 18 (Reuters) - A California legislative panel voted 
Wednesday to ask the state Senate to cite Reliant Energy Inc. < REI.N <aol://4785:REI>> for 
contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential 
documents. 

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted 6-0 to 
move against Houston-based Reliant, which joins fellow Texas energy giant 
Enron Corp. < ENE.N <aol://4785:ENE>> in facing what could be the first contempt citations 
imposed by California's state senate since 1929. 

Senate aides said the panel, which is investigating charges of market 
manipulation and price gouging in California's energy crisis, would now begin 
preparing a full report on Reliant's noncompliance for the full Senate. 

The committee's report on Enron could be ready for submission to the full 
Senate Thursday, they said, adding that continued efforts to negotiate an 
agreement had proved fruitless. 

According to state law, California's senators must use the reports to decide 
whether to slap sanctions on the two companies. They also have the option of 
fining or imprisoning company senior officers. 

Enron, for its part, has filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court 
challenging the investigative committee's authority to subpoena company 
documents. 

Senate aides said Reliant could follow the lead of another energy company, 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. < MIR.N <aol://4785:MIR>>, which has avoided the contempt threat by 
cooperating with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements, 
open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents 
there relating to the company's recent business in California. 

The committee also voted on Wednesday to suspend for 30 days proceedings 
against number of other energy firms, including Duke Energy Corp. < DUK.N <aol://4785:DUK>>, 
Dynegy Inc. < DYN.N <aol://4785:DYN>>, Williams Cos. Inc. < WMB.N <aol://4785:WMB>>, AES Corp. < AES.N <aol://4785:AES>> and NRG 
Energy Inc. < NRG.N <aol://4785:NRG>>, pending a review of their compliance efforts to date. 

Enron has argued the committee has no legal jurisdiction over wholesale 
electricity prices, which are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Committee (FERC), and that the committee's proceedings violate the company's 
legal rights. 

State officials have accused the energy companies of overcharging California 
power agencies and utilities some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity over 
the past 14 months, which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold. 

Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's 
poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough 
power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its 
industries.

Subject: Documentation Issues in the UK Gas and Power Markets


Hello all -

Following-up on our previous conversation on June 25, we would like to
schedule a call on July 18th to further discuss how to solve documentation
issues in the UK gas and power markets. As Katia is on holiday, would you
let me know of your availability on the 18th for a 10:00 a.m.(NY)/3:00 p.m.
(London) meeting.  We will arrange the call from ISDA's NY offices.

Our last conversation ended on the possibility of developing a master master
agreement for use with various energy agreements, however, there is some
concern that this might not be the best approach to close the documentation
gap in the UK.

We are very interested in trying to find a solution to the problem.  At this
juncture, the goal appears to be to develop documentation for the UK gas and
power markets that: 1) can be used with various energy agreements (masters &
stand-alone) 2)is amenable to non-ISDA members and supported by bigger
players, 3) accommodates physical and financial trades. (Please let me know
if there is anything to add.

To that end, it would be helpful to explore additional solutions on next
week's call.

Many thanks!

Thank you, James.

Ruth, Stacey, John and myself had some further discussion regarding our
meeting of last week.

As agreed, we will hold another call with yourself, Bernadette, Rita and
Christophe in order to discuss how to take this further.

I understand that Bernadette is out of the office until the end of this
week.

Could we arrange a call for the week of 9 July? Would that be OK for all of
you?

Another question, I spoke with Bernadette last week and she said she had
some written comments on the EMP regime. Could you please forward these to
me, as I am currently drafting the response to the FSA consultative paper.

Thank you in advance,

Katia

Katja, following our meeting, as agreed, here is a list of five entities
whose support may well assist any documentation initiative in the UK gas
market sponsored by ISDA.  I have not listed the power entities as the power
documentation (i.e. the GTMA) seems to be well established.  Please let me
know if you need any further details. Perhaps you also let us know whether
you want us to call any of these entities to foreshadow your call to them.

Many thanks.

Elizabeth and Mark,  thanks for your help in getting our bandwidth master sorted.  We've used the ISDA materials to relook at the formulation of the termination payment.  Could you possibly find it in your hearts to take a quick look at Section 5.4 regarding the calculation of the termination payment and the definition of Losses?  Again, I have tried to closely track the ISDA model.  Any thoughts would be gratefully received.

Please find attached a slightly revised version of the Bridge, marked up
against the version distributed with the e-mail attached below.

The amendments are intended to clarify the Automatic Early Termination point
(discussed below).

As stated in the previous e-mail, the deadline for final comments is the
close of business, London time, on Friday, 6th July.  After that time, the
proposed Bridge will be distributed to the Strategic Documentation Review
Task Force.  Please send comments to me at jberry@isda-eur.org

		Subject:	RE: Master Agreement Structural Issues
Working Group Meeting, June 18

		The Master Agreement Structural Issues Working Group met as
planned on 18th June.  As you know, the purpose of the meeting was to try to
finalise the terms of the Cross-Agreement Bridge.

		A few substantive comments were made in the meeting, so I am
distributing a slightly revised draft (marked up copy and clean copy)
together with a request for final comments by the close of business, London
time, on Friday, 6th July.  Please send comments to me at
jberry@isda-eur.org <mailto:jberry@isda-eur.org>  and to Peter Werner at
pwerner@isda-eur.org <mailto:pwerner@isda-eur.org> .

		The amendments to the draft reflect the view expressed in
the meeting that, where parties have specified Automatic Early Termination
to apply in their Master Agreement, parties should have the ability to
provide that a Bridging Event will occur immediately upon the deemed
designation of an Early Termination Date pursuant to the Automatic Early
Termination provisions.  In other words, if parties choose this option, and
an Early Termination Date is deemed to occur automatically under the ISDA
Master Agreement, there would be no opportunity to "disapply" the bridging
provisions.  The bridging provisions would also apply automatically.

		It is likely that the Strategic Documentation Review Task
Force will meet soon to discuss the work products of the different groups of
the Strategic Documentation Review that have been looking at ISDA's Master
Agreement.  At that point, the efforts of this group will come under further
scrutiny, so please do take this opportunity to review the attached final
draft!

but, as always, attendance in person is encouraged.

				The purpose of the meeting will be to try to
finalise the terms of the Bridge that takes an "agreement" (rather than a
"transaction") approach.

				I attach both a clean and a marked-up
version of the latest draft of the Bridge, together with some slides I used

Committee, and the minutes for that meeting.

				Please let my secretary, Anna Elia

Attached is a draft of the diesel swap definitions.  I am struggling with the concept of a mid-month tax increase.  Does it make any difference?  All comments welcome.  Walter

Hello Mark -- I have attached an updated agenda with a minor adjustment:
Emerging Market Forms is changed to Developing Products Market Forms to
better flow with the Committee focus on developing products with an
additional focus on weather derivatives and bandwidth.  This also appears to
be the appropriate place to explore the need to update ISDA's Commodity
Definitions.

Unless you have any objections or additional thoughts I'll go ahead and
issue this agenda with the invitation tomorrow.

I am trying to write a definition for the diesel index.  Can you take a look?  

Do you have a sample confirm so I could take a look at?

Recently I have come into possession of copies of two (2) partially
executed documents between our companies, and I have been asked by my boss
to follow up to procure one (1) original of our Electronic Trading
Agreement and one (1) copy of our fully executed Password Application.

On January 3, 2000 our counsel, Elaine M. Walsh, both faxed and FedEx'd
three items to you--an EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement, Password
Application, and Customer Registration Form.  Again, if you would be so
kind as to forward one of the originals of the Trading Agreement and one
copy of the Password Application, I would greatly appreciate it.  If you
have, in fact, already returned an original to us way back when, I would be
grateful to receive a copy of this fully executed document.

Very many thanks.

Sincerely,
Elise M. Devlin

Cheryl/Mark

Please find attached the credit worksheet, with credit terms, for the proposed ISDA between ECC and Canadian Hunter Resources, by its managing partner Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd.  We recently executed an EEI with this counterparty which was heavily negotiated and I would like the credit terms in this ISDA to mirror as closely as possible the agreed upon terms in the EEI.  Consequently, I am sending to you, via I/O mail, a copy of the cover sheet to the existing EEI for your reference and review.  Please call with questions or comments, and please put this on your **High** Priority List as we have a very short time frame for getting this ISDA completed and executed.
 


Thanks so much,
Wendy

Mark, I left you a message on Friday regarding the Riser Agreement that the Enron Networks business folks are anxious to put into place.  I understand that you will be out of town until Wednesday.  Is there anyone else on your staff that I could work with to get this fairly simple document reviewed and approved?  Many thanks.

The notice address is ok.  But the other provision is not.  Cargill has to agree to reverse the trade.  It is their Master Agreement, not Global's.  Neither I nor Mark will approve the document until that concept is accepted by Cargill.  Someplace along the line they have to step up to the plate.  Also, I have talked to Paul Radous and he is very serious about Bill Bradford seeing and approving the letter before it is executed.  Thanks, Frank

and further clarification on reversal of a

Sara -

I am a director in the market risk group who reports to David Port and Ted Murphy.  

Later this week, we will have a reporter from Risk magazine in our office to discuss various aspects of our risk management philosophy.  During the course of the discussion, he may observe confidential and proprietary information.  Do we have a standard legal confidentiality agreement for these situations?

Thanks,

Rudi

I've added the definitions to the confirm under a new section called "Additional Definitions." 

I had to adjust the price definitions to fit the current format (they are not defined terms - but numbers or index names.  Please let me know if the changes are acceptable.

Scott -

We have a new development effort under way for Enron Credit Inc.  This entity is an offshoot of our Enron Credit Ltd. group based in London.  Basically, Enron Credit has developed credit risk based products that basically hedge against bankruptcies and bad credit of customers.  The product described below - Risk Track - is a new product that is being developed for purposes of enabling Risk Metrics Group (credit risk company based in New York) to stream Enron Credit's credit information through a web based site to Risk Metrics Group subscribers.

The actual product has been developed, but in discussions with our business personnel it was determined that they would like to confirm that the RiskTrack does not violate any existing trademarks.  Accordingly, please have a basic trademark search performed for this name based upon the information provided below.  If additional information is needed, please let me know.

Thanks.  Have a good weekend.

Mark

Dear Mark and Tana,
After reviewing the password applications available on the Clickpaper and EnronOnline websites it appears that several countries have access to EOL but not to Clickpaper (please see attached).    Since due dilligence has already been completed for the EOL countries and soon Clickpaper will migrate to the EnronOnline trading platform, it seems it might not be too difficult to add mirroring Clickpaper password applications.  Is that the case?  We have business interests in several of the countries accessible solely via EOL.
Best regards,
Marla Thompson

Hello all -

Following-up on our previous conversation on June 25, we would like to
schedule a call on July 18th to further discuss how to solve documentation
issues in the UK gas and power markets. As Katia is on holiday, would you
let me know of your availability on the 18th for a 10:00 a.m.(NY)/3:00 p.m.
(London) meeting.  We will arrange the call from ISDA's NY offices.

Our last conversation ended on the possibility of developing a master master
agreement for use with various energy agreements, however, there is some
concern that this might not be the best approach to close the documentation
gap in the UK.

We are very interested in trying to find a solution to the problem.  At this
juncture, the goal appears to be to develop documentation for the UK gas and
power markets that: 1) can be used with various energy agreements (masters &
stand-alone) 2)is amenable to non-ISDA members and supported by bigger
players, 3) accommodates physical and financial trades. (Please let me know
if there is anything to add.

To that end, it would be helpful to explore additional solutions on next
week's call.

Many thanks!

Thank you, James.

Ruth, Stacey, John and myself had some further discussion regarding our
meeting of last week.

As agreed, we will hold another call with yourself, Bernadette, Rita and
Christophe in order to discuss how to take this further.

I understand that Bernadette is out of the office until the end of this
week.

Could we arrange a call for the week of 9 July? Would that be OK for all of
you?

Another question, I spoke with Bernadette last week and she said she had
some written comments on the EMP regime. Could you please forward these to
me, as I am currently drafting the response to the FSA consultative paper.

Thank you in advance,

Katia

Katja, following our meeting, as agreed, here is a list of five entities
whose support may well assist any documentation initiative in the UK gas
market sponsored by ISDA.  I have not listed the power entities as the power
documentation (i.e. the GTMA) seems to be well established.  Please let me
know if you need any further details. Perhaps you also let us know whether
you want us to call any of these entities to foreshadow your call to them.

Many thanks.

Dear all,

After having consulted with my colleagues, here is our pinch of salt.

We believe markets participants would be interested in the following topics:

*	E-Commerce Panel Discussion: 	why some platforms succeed and
others do not (e.g Enron vs. ICE)
					the impact of e-trading on
standardized documentation


*	Convergence of Trading Forms:	role of a master master in energy
markets/cross product netting
					how to deal with different
standardized documentation in Europe for similar products, e.g. EFET, GTMA


*	Workshop One:			collateralization of physical gas
and electricity transactions under the CSA

My esteemed colleague Rita is happy to present a paper on the development of
the EFET gas master and/or coal trading and has also volunteered to
participate to one panel. I have also asked another colleague to give an
update on the status of EFET for power trading in Continental Europe (I
don't have his reply yet).

Best Regards

Subject:=09Mandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contr=
acts


One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se=
rvices (EWS) manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights.  This is par=
ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com=
modity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of wh=
ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This=
 complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat=
ed entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual s=
etoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master =
contracts.

=09A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that =
will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with w=
hom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set fort=
h below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negoti=
ating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff l=
anguage be added.


MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR=20
EWS TRADING CONTRACTS

=09(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D=
ate, the Non-Defaulting Party ("X") may, at its option and in its discretio=
n, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party ("Y") by X or a=
ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), ins=
trument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affi=
liates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) =
or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp=
ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent =
of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y not=
ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after =
the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not =
affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, "Owed"=
 shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless o=
f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Term=
ination Date.  =09

=09Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be conver=
ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t=
he rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good f=
aith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c=
onverted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate t=
hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the releva=
nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothi=
ng in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other securit=
y interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff pr=
ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, =
netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other righ=
t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operatio=
n of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknow=
ledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of =
the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties =
would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further ackno=
wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip=
al and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affilia=
tes, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and oth=
erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as=
 it relates to Section ___.

=09(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre=
ement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default=
ing Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receiv=
es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may =
include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind w=
hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaultin=
g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag=
reement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early=
 Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

=09This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du=
e and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future p=
ayments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular se=
toff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language ha=
s been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. l=
aws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group =
will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic=
tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, =
prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be require=
d to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other=
 than Events of Default (e.g. "Affected Party" under ISDA).  Finally, when =
incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aw=
are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term=
s (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (app=
licable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should =
remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add=
 setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff la=
nguage into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determ=
ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi=
ll need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist a=
ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of=
 preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua=
lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be=
 able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distribut=
ed shortly.

=09If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-6544 or Elizabet=
h Sager at 713-853-6349.

Paul -
 
Sorry for the delayed response, but I am just back from vacation and trying to dig out from under all of the e-mails and voice mails.
 
As to the information below, in relation to any agreement Net Works has with any service provider to promote EOL prices, the only requirement we maintain is to ensure that any data we provide is consistent among all service providers.  Accordingly, any information we are providing to "vwd" must be the same as we provide to other service providers. 
 
As to other issues related to quoting prices to "vwd" for distribution to third parties, we need to ensure that proper disclaimers are included with the information (e.g., that it is not an offer by Enron, cannot be offered to Enron through the content provider or its portal/website, etc.).  Justin can assist with these as I believe there is some standard language he has developed.  I would also suggest we consider putting in place an agreement of some sort with "vwd" to insure that issues such as consistency of content, distribution of content and payment for the content (if applicable) are addressed.  If this is a one time deal, an agreement may not be necessary; however, if it will be a consistent feed of information, an agreement is strongly suggested. 
 
Any other issues that I can think of would probably be more so related to local laws and regulations.  Once again, Justin would be the best source for advise on these.
 
Please let me know if you should need anything further.
 
Mark

Hi Mark - can I get your legal view on this? Justin had mentioned some potential considerations (Reuters specialist data agreement,  non-binding element, and also attribution).  
 
Please let me know as soon as soon as you can or feel free to give me a call.
 
Thanks,

Hi Carrie,
the prices that we are currently quoting to vwd are: 4Q01, 1Q, 2Q, 3Q of 2002.
This had been OKed with the coal trading desk and EOL .
 
We have received an official request and I would like to get back to them soonest possible.
I appreciate if you can take a lead on this and let us know what we can do and what we cannot.

Sven,
 
Paul and I discussed this last night.  He is looking into the details of our agreement with Reuters because it could prevent us from doing what you want to do. 
 
Also, could you tell me a little more about what we are currently giving "vwd" and what is getting published on the energy portal?  How often are the prices supplied and on how many products?  Currently, Reuters shows three products and it is part of our agreement not to give other organizations more than what we're giving Reuters.
 
I agree that from a marketing point of view the exposure could be great, but there could be a lot of legal issues to work through.  What was your desired timeline on this?

Hi Carrie,
As you know I have been active in marketing SECA prices in the German market. They are currently published by "vwd" (a trade journal) and are now also displayed on an energy portal. This energy portal has come back to us and would like to also distribute those prices to third parties. 
 
While from a pure marketing and awareness perspective, this would do some good to the SECA, I am not too sure about the legal side of this. What is our position on this one ?! Please let me know.
 
Kind regards
Sven

I received all the paperwork from you, thanks. Just as a note, the reason I
didn't receive the first package is due to a wrong address. My current
address is 666 5th Ave, NYC, NY 10103.I do need one more signature from
you.I will e-mail the form and you can fax it back to me. My fax # is
212-765-1057. Thanks. JL
