Date: Wednesday, May 1, 2002

It is with mixed emotion that I confirm that Dan Leff will be leaving Enron in mid-May.  Dan was approached by and has accepted an excellent position with another company.  Dan recently stepped up to manage the wholesale and retail businesses.  In a short time, he has developed a solid team and a clear plan that can move forward under the direction of Bob Semple from Zolfo Cooper and our funtional leaders including Jeremy Blachman, Anthony Dayao, Eric Holzer, Kyle Kitagawa, Don Miller, Vicki Sharp, Ed Smida, and Wade Stubblefield.  I am sorry to lose Dan, but I want to congratulate him and wish him well in his new career.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

The Bankruptcy Court order authorizing the Key Employee Retention, Liquidation Incentive and Severance Plan (the "KERP") requires that, before receiving any payment under the KERP, each participant certify that he or she has not engaged in insider trading of the Company's stock.  To receive any KERP payment, you must print, complete, and return the attached certificate. 
 
If you wish to review Enron's policy regarding insider trading, you can find the Securities Trades by Company Personnel section of the Code of Ethics at: 
<<<http://home.enron.com/resources/policies/code_of_ethics/code_of_ethics100600.pdf >>>
  
To ensure that you receive your first payment, you should:
Completely and legibly fill out the form.
Deliver it to the designated receptacle in the lobby on the 16th floor by  no later than 5:00 p.m., Monday, June 3, 2002.
Do not drop it in the mail.

Unfortunately, late forms will result in a delay in payment.  Thank you for your hard work and continued commitment to Enron.

Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in 
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we 
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) 
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer the 
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at 
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose 
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals  
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday  resulting in taking the 
Sunday's gain away from your book.  

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.


Kimat

For the year

My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This 
morining it should have been $123035.00.

I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued 
at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

EMPLOYEE NEWS LINE

ENRON POSTS JOBS
The company is reinstituting a job posting process to help fill open positions.  In the midst of restructuring, the number of job openings is understandably limited.   However, postings will be updated regularly.  Within the job posting system called jobOps, an employee can apply for a position by using their current employee profile as their resume or modify it to create an updated resume.  Employee's can still update their profile information in eHRonline.  At this time, only current employees will be able to apply for a position from within jobOps.  You may access current postings by visiting https://hrglobal.enron.com/JobOps.  The system can also be reached by clicking on the jobOps link from http://Home.enron.com or http:hrweb.enron.com.  

COMPANY RESUMES SERVICE AWARDS
Enron has resumed its Service Awards Program to recognize employees' years of service to the organization.  Employees in both debtor and non-debtor companies are eligible to receive service awards upon their employment anniversary every five years.  Employees who are nearing an employment anniversary or passed an anniversary while the program was suspended will soon receive by mail a brochure and order form that allows them to select their individual gift.  The selection of gifts has recently been updated yet still includes favorites such as pen and pencil sets, knives, jewelry or grandfather clocks depending on an employee's years of service to the company.  Service award notification, gift catalogues, and order forms will be available to eligible employees online in the near future.

From:  Human Resources
Re:  First Collection Milestone Achieved

Several weeks ago, we told you we believed we had hit our first cash collection milestone, and indeed we have.  Representatives for the unsecured creditors' committee and the ENA examiner are currently validating our cash collections and we expect them to verify the milestone very soon.  The bankruptcy court judge has also signed the official motion related to the retention and LIP plans, so it is final with no additional follow-up with the court required.  Soon, all the pieces will be in place to make our first Liquidation Incentive Pool dispersement.  Because it will be our first dispersement, we are taking the needed time to establish an accurate and equitable process for this and future payouts.  We plan to hold a meeting with all LIP participants in the next week or two to walk through the procedures we've developed and answer any questions.  We'll be in contact with you soon to schedule that meeting.  

Thank you,
Robert Jones

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.

To:  Enron Employees Worldwide
From:  Stephen Cooper
Date:  Thursday, May 2, 2002

As I mentioned at the employee meeting in April, this Friday, May 3, we will present to the Creditors' Committee a plan to separate our core energy assets from the estate and the issues surrounding our bankruptcy through a process called a "363 Sale."  These assets are viable businesses that represent Enron's roots.  If we are able to move quickly, we believe this 363 Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets.

We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors' Committee.  However, the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today.  To ensure accuracy, we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon.

I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team.  Yet until we present to the Creditors' Committee, we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees.  We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week.  In the meantime, we've attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal.


Enron Plans Return to Its Roots --- Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard Assets
By Rebecca Smith and Mitchell Pacelle
The Wall Street Journal

	Enron Corp. plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name, according to a draft copy of the firm's plans -- returning to its roots of a decade ago, before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse. 
	Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday, Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about $10 billion in North and South America. The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enron's fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances.
	It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court, quickly giving Enron's creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company -- or sell it off, whole or in parts, if more attractive bids emerge. 
	Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houston-based company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of off-balance-sheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives. After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp., the company sought bankruptcy-court protection in December, the largest such filing in U.S. history. 
	The new plan calls for a small operating company -- for now dubbed "OpCO Energy Co." -- to own power plants, electric utilities, natural-gas pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas facilities, but little else. The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon; Elektro, a Sao Paulo-based Brazilian utility and about 15,000 miles of pipeline assets on both continents -- less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed. 
	The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other U.S. energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas, giving it few advantages over competitors. It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its U.S. rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region. 
	Nevertheless, Enron's new management team, headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcy-reorganization process that could hurt their value. Under the company's plan, all of Enron's other assets would be liquidated in that process. The number of employees would drop steeply -- from about 23,000 today (already down from a peak of 31,000 before the bankruptcy) to around 12,000. 
	"In my view, we're going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years, because of the difficulty we're going to have resolving all of the claims," Mr. Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon, after Enron's board had met to go over the plan. 
	A spinoff, he said, also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims. Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company, Mr. Cooper predicted: "Once we're out from under, what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs." 
	Enron's creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold. Mr. Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors -- who have asserted billions of dollars in claims -- that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enron's core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale. Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them, these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably, or to proceed directly to a liquidation. 
	"The [creditors'] committee has a bunch of bright, reasonable businesspeople on it," said Mr. Cooper. "Their goal, to maximize value, is consistent with ours. I'm confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach." 
	Luc Despins, a lawyer for the creditors' committee, said he hadn't yet seen the plan and couldn't comment. 
	Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting. If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors, Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court, which must then approve it. 
	The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth, returning the company to its size in 1992, when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and then-President Richard Kinder were running the company. Four years later, Mr. Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling, under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energy-trading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern. 
	Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain. "The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron," the draft business plan says. In addition to winning support from creditors, Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co., a deal which hasn't yet closed. 
	In recent months, new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enron's complicated financial arrangements. They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of "SPEs" or special-purpose entities. They were created, beginning in the mid-1990s, as a way to pump up profits, hide debt and raise money from outside investors. 
	The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company, some of which may be entangled in these special-purpose entities. For example, Centragas, a pipeline company in Colombia, is a proposed asset of the new company. But separate, internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles, Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP. They, in turn, may have passed along interests to other Enron entities, Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP. 
	The company said it is trying to "unwind" many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company, but it cautioned that "the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented" for the new company. 
	If the new company is created as outlined, its pro forma net income -- based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain -- is projected to be $243 million this year, $352 million next year, $450 million in 2004 and $503 million by 2005. That is based on assets of $10.1 billion currently, rising to $11 billion by 2003. 
	That's a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak. In 2000, the last year that full financial records were posted by the company, Enron said its net income was $979 million on $100.8 billion in revenue. Those numbers -- as well as financial statements in the previous three years -- were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators. 
	The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is "already overloaded with properties for sale" and prices aren't very good. Enron's collapse is partly to blame for that market glut, because credit standards have been tightening, forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt.

Central Parking is currently working on the gated access system of the Allen Center Garage to improve its operation.  Over the next four to six weeks, the existing system will be replaced with new, improved technology.  In the meantime, Enron Property Services is working with Central Parking to develop a short term solution to improve access in and out of the garage.

If you experience a problem entering or exiting the garage with your access card, call Martin Katz at extension 59322.  Indicate where the problem occurred (Gold, Green or Blue Garage), whether it was upon entering or exiting, and the time of day the malfunction occurred.  This will enable Property Services to help Central Parking pinpoint the problem areas that should be addressed first.

If you currently use a transponder for entering or exiting the Allen Center Garage, please contact the Parking & Transportation desk at extension 37060.  Arrangements will be made to immediately replace your transponder with a new access card.  The transponder system is experiencing the majority of problems and will be taken out of service in the future.

To:  Participants of the Enron Corp. Savings Plan
From:  Enron Benefits Department

Several weeks ago, we announced that beginning July 1, 2002, the company would again match employees' eligible contributions to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan ("the Plan").  We also announced that from July 1 through December 31, 2002, Enron would double the rate of the company match that was in effect prior to the suspension.  Based on your questions and feedback, we want to further clarify the double match and share with you some further modifications we are making to the administration of the match.

Doubling the Match
Doubling the match will accelerate the rate at which company matching contributions accumulate. However, the annual company matching contributions remain limited to 50 percent of an employee's pre-tax contributions, up to 6 percent of eligible compensation.

For example, assume a participant contributes the 2002 Federal pre-tax maximum of $11,000 to the Plan.  The company match in effect prior to its suspension was $.50 for each $1 contributed, so the maximum amount the employee would have received in company matching contributions would have been $5,500, or half of $11,000. With the double match, the same participant will receive $1 for each $1 contributed, but the match will not exceed $5,500.  Likewise, if a participant contributes $8,000 pre-tax during 2002, the company matching contribution would equal $4,000.  

"Truing Up" the Match for Previous Contributions
Many participants in the Plan expressed concern that contributions to the Plan prior to July were not eligible for the reinstated company match.  To rectify this, we are modifying the administration of the match for the remainder of 2002.

Employees who were active as of December 31, 2001, and who participate in the Plan, will receive the double match for contributions made after July 1, 2002.  If at the end of 2002, the matched amount falls short of the maximum level possible based on the participant's annual pre-tax contributions to the Plan, the company will "true up" their match for 2002 to ensure the company contributions equal what would have been received had the match not been suspended.

For example, if an active employee's annual pre-tax contribution to the Plan will reach $11,000, and on July 1 the employee has already contributed $7,000, the remaining employee pre-tax contribution allowed will be $4000.  With the double match, the employee will receive $4,000 in company matching contributions between July and December, but will be $1,500 short of the company matching contributions he or she would have otherwise received.  On December 31, 2002, the employee's company matching contributions would be trued up with $1,500.

New Hires and Rehires After January 1, 2002
Any participants in the Plan hired or re-hired after January 1, 2002, will not be eligible for the double match.  Instead, they will receive the same match level in effect prior to suspension of the company match.  However, at the end of the year, they too will receive a true up to reach the maximum company match contributions for their annual pre-tax employee contribution.

Terminations Prior to December 31, 2002
If a Plan participant's employment is terminated involuntarily prior to December 31, 2002, the true up will take place as early as practical after termination.  The total amount of company matching contributions, including any true up, will be based on year-to-date contributions up to the time the participant is terminated.

If a Plan participant resigns voluntarily, he or she is not eligible for a true up, but will receive the double match on any pre-tax contributions made to the Plan between July 1 and his or her termination.

Participating in the Plan
Active Enron employees who are not currently participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan have until 3:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, June 27, 2002 to enroll in the Plan for their first July payroll contribution to be matched.  The same deadline applies to active participants in the Plan who may wish to increase their Savings Plan contribution rate in time for the first July payroll.  (For now, participants can only increase their contribution rate to the current maximum of 15 percent of their base salary.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution rate to the new maximum of 50 percent.)

To enroll in the Savings Plan or make a change to your current contributions, please log on to <<http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>>, or call the Benefit Service Center at 1-800-332-7979, option 3.

Some LDC tariffs are available through the state PUC web sites, but not 
many.  If you're looking for particular LDC's, I can get you the PUC web 
sites.

Also, you might check with Paul Tate in EES (handles east region logistics).  
EES used to have some kind of data base into which they were loading the LDC 
tariffs, but I could never get into it.  I think it was called E-file or 
something like that.  Since they sold off the group that was developing it, 
it may not be available to us anymore.

(Let me know what you find out.)

The Bankruptcy Court order authorizing the Key Employee Retention, Liquidation Incentive and Severance Plan (the "KERP") requires that, before receiving any payment under the KERP, each participant certify that he or she has not engaged in insider trading of the Company's stock.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

As Steve Cooper indicated in the employee meeting, we are undertaking efforts to improve the work environment at Enron.  Two such initiatives are being kicked off next week.

First, employees will be able to reinstate I.D. badge purchase privileges.  Beginning Tuesday, April 16, 2002, current Houston-based Enron employees will be able to activate their employee I.D. badge to make purchases at the Energizer, Express Store, and the Plaza Java Coffee kiosk.  Charges will be deducted directly from their paycheck.

To activate your I.D. badge for purchases, please follow the steps outlined below:  
?	Complete a new I.D. badge charge form.  Forms may be picked up at any cash register in the Energizer, Express Store, and Plaza Java.  A printable form is attached below for your convenience.  
?	Sign and date the form.  Doing so authorizes Payroll to deduct charges from your semi-monthly paychecks.  Unsigned and undated forms will be returned to the applicant.  
?	Return the form to Richard Hensch at EB1653a, or to any cashier at the above locations.
?	Allow three days for activation.  

Additionally, there is good news for coffee drinkers.  Beginning Monday, April 15, the operating hours for the Plaza Java coffee kiosk will be extended to 4:00 p.m. for a two-week trial basis.  During that time, participation will be monitored to determine whether the later closing time will be continued.

Questions may be referred to mailto:Richard.Hensch@enron.com.

We have good news for participants of the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  Last Friday, the creditors' committee and our board of directors approved our proposal to reinstate the company match.  We can enact the match in the normal course of business without bankruptcy court approval.

Beginning July 1, 2002, Enron will again match employee pre-tax contributions to the Plan.  The match will be credited to active participants' eligible contributions on their first paycheck in July.

In addition, from July 1 through December 31, 2002, Enron will double the rate of the company match that was in effect prior to the suspension, with a maximum match on employee pretax contributions of 6 percent of base salary.  In January 2003, the rate of the company match will return to the level in effect prior to the suspension.

Beyond reinstating the match, Enron is also instituting the following enhancements to the Savings Plan:
?	The company match will follow participants' investment elections.  In other words, the company match will be allocated to the same funds in which the participant has elected to invest.
?	Currently, participants are able to contribute one to 15 percent of their base salaries to the Savings Plan.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution up to a maximum of 50 percent of their base salary.  The 2002 federal limit for pre-tax contributions to the Savings Plan is $11,000.
?	Participants who are age 50 or older in 2002 will be able to contribute up to $12,000 of pre-tax income to the Savings Plan in 2002.  This additional $1,000 is not eligible for company-matched contributions.

Active Enron employees who are not currently participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan have until 3:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, June 27, 2002 to enroll in the Plan for their first July payroll contribution to be matched.  The same deadline applies to active participants in the Plan who may wish to increase their Savings Plan contribution rate in time for the first July payroll.  (For now, participants can only increase their contribution rate to the current maximum of 15 percent of base salary.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution rate to the new maximum of 50 percent.)

To enroll in the Savings Plan or make a change to your current contributions, please log on to <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>, or call the Benefit Service Center at 1-800-332-7979, option 3.

Since our OpCo proposal became public, some in the media and others have assumed Enron's new name will be OpCo.  That's a mistake -- OpCo is only a temporary name.  As I've said before, employees should have an opportunity to participate in naming a new company.  And now, here's your chance.

We are just beginning the process to name a corporation that would essentially be an energy asset holding company.  The individual assets within this proposed holding company would not adopt the new name, but continue to use their existing names -- Transwestern Pipeline, Northern Border Partners, Portland General Electric, Elektro, and others.  These names are familiar and reputible within their respective markets.

To submit a name or names for consideration, send an email with your ideas to me at Office of the Chief Executive anytime between now and the end of June.  Over the next few months, we'll be narrowing a list and making a selection.  We will announce the chosen name later in the year once we know the outcome of the OpCo auction process.

I hope you have fun with this and I look forward to seeing your ideas,
Steve Cooper

By now you have probably heard about three memos that discuss questionable trading strategies at Enron involving the California market. The memos were brought to the Board's attention several days ago, and the Board voted on Sunday to waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to those documents. On Monday, we turned the memos over to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission and other appropriate agencies. There are likely to be a number of investigations into this issue, and as we have with all current investigations, we will cooperate fully with these efforts. If you should be contacted in regard to this matter, I encourage you to contact Bob Williams in our legal group at 713-345-2402. However, while these investigations continue to look into the past, our focus must be on the future and on moving this company forward. 
Thanks for your continued efforts, 
Steve Cooper
