The summer reception has been scheduled at Jalapeno's (same as last
year), 2702 Kirby Drive (just south of Westheimer), 713-524-1668 for
July 26 from 5:30 to 8 pm. I should be receiving the menu options
this week.

Have any of you received sponsorship pledges from your companies? If
you have, please let me know the company and the amount. We still
need some so that we won't have to dip into the reserves. Please also
try asking your classmates who work in Houston about their companies
sponsoring this event. I am also trying at my end.

If you need to reach me: home: 281-218-6598, cell: 713-703-4312

Thanks for your help,

Glenn.

>Hello all!
>
>I am Glenn Sprenger, one of the co-chairs of the Houston Graduate
>Business Network chapter. Arrion forwarded your names to me as
>students who are willing to help with the summer reception.
>
>If you are still interested, please let me know. Also include any
>ideas you have about the reception.
>
>Last year we held it at Jalapenos Mexican restaurant on Kirby just
>south of Westheimer. It worked really well, but I am open to new
>suggestions.
>
>As far as a date, I was thinking of Wednesday, July 26. This is 3
>weeks before orientation so new students should still be in Houston
>and not in Austin yet.
>
>We also would like to get sponsors - more than one is NOT a problem.
>This reception provides companies an excellent opportunity to
>introduce themselves FIRST to MBA's entering the program, as well as
>stay in touch with MBA alumni.  Please contact your internship
>companies and see if they would be interested in being a sponsor
>this year. We will gladly accept any amount offered, but you might
>want to start at $1000. We can provide them space to hang a banner
>and set out brochures explaining their company. Their company
>representatives will also be invited to socialize at the event.
>
>I am looking forward to meeting all of you individually. I may be
>contacted via email or at 281-218-6598. Please respond soon if you

The Moonlight Prowl is a nighttime tour of the campus filled with
anecdotes of student life, University history, and all sorts of "UT lore."
Stories have been collected from professors' memoirs, old newspaper
accounts, and from the countless boxes in the UT archives. The Prowl is
intended to help "personalize" the University, explore a little of its 
history,
and have some fun.
The tour is free! For a schedule, some Prowl Stories, and even a UT
Trivia Quiz, check out the Moonlight Prowl web site.

INTRODUCING THE UT MEMORY BANK:
http://www.utexas.edu/tours/prowl

Here's your chance to make history! The UT Memory Bank is a serious
effort to collect the personal anecdotes, recollections and other memories
of students, ex-students, faculty and staff, and others associated with the
University. Over time, contributions to the Bank will form a "collective
memory" of the University's history.
All submissions will be printed and donated to a special collection in the
University Archives for posterity, and will also be posted on the Moonlight
Prowl web site for others to enjoy, sorted by decade. See for yourself, and
contribute to the collection!

I've just looked at some beautiful photos--hand colored done by our project
manager's wife--she is a professional photographer.  How would you all feel
about having a really good, artistic picture done of the three of us for a
gift to Mom and Dad?  Let me know--we could do it while Sally is here for
the shower....

Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she 
will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep 
will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both 
wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you 
can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a 
way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new 
role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally

A TOAST TO TEXAS!
As early as 1900, March 2 became a day for Texas Exes to observe as a 
holiday. A
great deal of tradition and sentiment surrounds the celebration
on the local level. In that year, The Ex-Students' Association adopted a 
resolution that:
"Whenever two Texas Exes shall meet on March 2, they shall sit and break 
bread and
pay tribute to the institution that made their education possible." UT alumni 
all over the
world have followed this tradition. Wherever you are on March 2, 2001, we 
hope you'll
join us in a Texas "toast":  To our State, whose founders made our education 
possible;
To Texas Exes who have provided generations of leadership; And to the proud 
tradition
of continued excellence of The University of Texas.Hook'em Horns! For more

Hi, Sal.   Just thinking about the weekend . . .  Any ideas for what we
should do?  Is there a fun place to go to dinner on Saturday?   Sunday is
Father's Day - are you going to want to go to church? (should we bring
clothes?)     Last time I visited you, I decided I would keep the Houston
directions somewhere - but, of course, I don't know where that is.   So,
could you send me directions yet one more time?  THanks!    Love, Cara

Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could "chip in"
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.? 
?
Have a good trip. Linda

Jeffrey's/Josephine sounds excellent.  I could go for the decorating
thing--that would be fun for me....I still think somethign like a limo is in
order.  It may not be our personalities but I think Mother likes a big
to-do.

okay - I would advise this though:  Since we may all be spending $$ on a
trip on Nov. as well, I think we can be a bit judicious about what we do in
June.   I don't think we need to do anything on the order that we did it 10
years ago . . . I'll be thinking of some restaurant ideas as well.

I tell you what might be nice:   Jeffrey's has a private dining area (think
called Josephine's house) - we had Crockett Int. Christmas there last year -
and Sally had some Enron doo there - I think we could decorate it a bit and
it would be quite nice.   -c.

Dear Sally,

Hope you had a good trip to Dallas, although it was a bit interrupted with
you trip back to Houston for Meagan's Open House.  Dad and I would like be
with you all on Friday the 20th of October.  I believe that may have been the
game we attended last year too.  We have meetings, the other two dates, so if
that still works for you we will plan on that date.  It also gives Dad a bit
more time to hopefully get his voice.  He returns to "DR" Bob Raley, week
after next for the results of all the testing he did this week.

Glad you will be over on Tuesday-we will look forward to seeing you then and
glad you will have time for a visit after lunch tool.

Love,

Sue

Sally,

Shari Mao contacted her boyfriend and he gave her the name of a larynx 
specialist at Methodist Hospital - Dr. Donald T. Donovan (713-798-5900).  I 
hope this might be helpful.

This is Cara's assistant, Cara White.   Cara asked me to send you her
itinerary:

Cara will be in New York for a week.

Thursday through Saturday, she will stay at the Edison Hotel (212) 840-5000

Sunday through Wednesday, she will stay at the Grand Hyatt (she doesn't know
the telephone no. - and I am such a busy personal assistant, I don't have
time to look it up.)

Also, until Sunday, you may try her husband's cell phone (512) 657-1555

You can always try Cara's cell phone (512) 970-0608 - but she hasn't really
figured out how to retrieve messages yet - so you'll probably have better
luck leaving a message at the hotel.

Cara will return on Thursday evening on American Flight #1669, arriving at
4:25 P.M.

Dear Sally and Cindy,

Just received an invitation to Dot's birthday party which the Baptist Church
in Hallettsville is giving for her.  The party will be on September 9th at
10:30 AM at church, and Dot's children are inviting us to the house
afterwards.  I will forward a copy of the invitation to  you.  Just wanted to
get the date to you now.

Just so you can see where my paycheck now goes.  What a great way to spend 
money!

Here are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 
days old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day 
she'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I 
didn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person 
(better) because of her.  
Yesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she 
was doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We 
are settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it 
gives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down 
to the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I 
hope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by 
the way, the blonde at the hospital with me is my youngest sister, Kerri)

Hi, Sally...

Wanted to apologize for the way I probably sounded on the phone--lots was
going on here and you caught me at a brain-overload moment!

Thanks for sending the Enron article--thought it was great--brought it in to
the office to show you off here...

Pictures of the girls were much appreciated--can't really believe how old
they look.  Brigeda's has taken possession of them and put them on her
bulletin board--although she wanted BIGGER ones like Grandmom--told her
Grandmoms always got bigger ones....Brigeda gets her picture taken next week
and will send you one--last year's was so dorky we didn't circulate them
much...

Dad actually seemed better yesterday.  He was making jokes and his voice was
a little stronger--he's on pain medication for his tongue--I think giving
him something to make him relax really does help--he wasn't loopy just not
quite so tense.   He seemed very "up" for the dr's appt in Houston.  I told
him you asked Fabe for the best ENT in Houston and that this guy was in your
church and did Meagan's tonsils.  He liked all of that information a
lot...thanks again for arranging this.  Mom and I decided if anyone could
get him to a doctor on short notice you would be able to do it--now the
pressure is on!

Hope you have a great weekend--Brigeda and I are looking forward to see you
guys next weekend.

Cindy

Hello, sistas-

Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine's House.   Here's some
additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:

1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event.

2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3
entrees and 2 desserts.   If we have a special request, we can let her know;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery's chef has
cookin' that night.

3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.    Preferences?

4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal.   She suggested oysters (for which they
are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.  These would be
served as guests arrive.

5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event.   Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine.   I told her I'd check with you - but that we wouldn't be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.    I thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple.

Thoughts, everyone?      -the youngest and fattest

Dear Sally,

I decided that this would be the quickest way to get in touch this afternoon,
as I know you must be very busy after taking yesterday off to be with us, and
also I know you will have many things you would like to do at home tonight.
There is no way to say thanks for the great two days.  You are always so
gracious and generous in every way, time, thought, etc.

I really enjoyed going with you to your office and now I can picture you each
day.  I found it very pleasent to sit at your desk.  Please tell Patti that I
enjoyed meeting her.

Thanks so much for taking me to see the interesting shop, and I will look
forward to going there again and using my generous Mother's Day gift
certificate!!  I am still thinking about the table I saw there-it is not a
lot larger than the table I have, but I like the fact that it is a cabinet.

It was very interesting to see your house and what has been done and what you
plan to do with your furnishings.  I think it will be wonderful and I look
forward to seeimg it all finished.  Keep me posted on what is going on and
what decisions you make.  I really do think you and your family will enjoy
the spacious large room.

I do hope David will have good news about his problem and hope that it can be
easily treated.

I thoroughly enjoyed the recital, and I think Amanda played beautifully.
Please tell her that I am so proud of her with the way she is doing in her
music, with the wonderful gold medal, and also doing so great in her school
work.  I hope she has a great two weeks at camp, and I am sure that you will
send me her camp address.  When you have time we can plan her visit time.

It was fun seeing Meagan, and she was very thoughtful to bring Michael by to
see us.  I mentioned to her that if she just wanted a change of scenery after
she goes to camp we would love for her to come over and visit.

Tyler was so much fun too, and especially now that he really knows who we are
and is comfortable with us.  We better stay strong and well so he can have
some visits with us!

I know I probably have forgotten something, but  the visit with you was
great.  Thanks you for being such a loving, thoughtful, and generous
daughter.  I am very proud of you.

Much love,

Mom

Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,
Stephanie

Everything sounds good, but can we use .html instead? .htm doesn't work on
Linux web servers, and it's best to be universal, in case they want to
deploy in diff. contexts.

So that we can avoid last minute "oh my gosh we've used different file
structures/naming convention--quick we need to change all of these paths in
the next ten minutes", can we do the following?

All html files will be considered as in the root directory and will use the
extension of ".htm"

Subdirectories/folders:

images--images for Sales Guide and Intro and any image that is used
throughout the deliverable, such as logos, navigation buttons, etc.  So an
example would  be: images/dell_logo.gif

scripts--one script folder for all of the Coursebuilder scripts used in the
deliverable

timer--for the timer interaction that Daniel is building

images/mollie--for images specific to Mollie pages (this way if we have more
than one drag/drop we won't have to rename any Coursebuilder created
images/targets, etc.

images/warren

images/sally

images/david

Will this work for everyone?  If not, please let me know and I will send out
modifications.

Cindy

Hey guys I need your help

There is one Topic that we still can't seem to get taken care of: S2M1T2.

Sally rewrote the storyboards and, according to my understanding, it was
handed off to Emrul and then Cindy fixed the html pages for the revised
content. But on the server we still have the old version of these files.

What is going on with these files? Gerry would you be able to figure out
what's happening? Did it get to Emrul? Did it get to Cindy? Did it get
posted? Did older versions get copied over the newer versions?

We *need* to get this Topic done for review-- it was due to Linda almost a
week ago. Can you please let me know when it's ready for my review and edit,
so we can get it out to Linda.

Thanks,
Warren

Hi, Sal.   Hope you are well.   I was out of town most of last week - and
again Sunday/Monday, so I feel a bit out of it!   How was Meagan's birthday?
Did she pass the driving test?   Did the earrings arrive in time?     Any
other news?   No big news here; just work.  Off to Arlington again on Friday
for a Special Olympics event, then on to a wedding Saturday.   Holiday
Monday.  Yippee!    How do you think the parental units are doing?   (I must
confess, I haven't talked to them too much lately . . . )    love, cara

Sally,

Thought this was good....


Cindy

Hey, here is another wonderful group of facts about women.  I don't
normally like to pass these on but it has too much importance.  Even if
your a skeptic read to the bottom.



Did you know that it's Beautiful Women Month? Well, it is and that means
you.


There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels . . .and only
eight who do. Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14. If Barbie was a real woman,
she'd have to walk on all fours due to her proportions. The average woman
weighs 144 lbs and wears between a 9-14. One out of every four college aged
women has an eating disorder. The models in the magazines are airbrushed --
not perfect!

A psychological study in 1995 found that three minutes spent looking at a
fashion magazine caused 70% of women to feel depressed, guilty, and
shameful.  Models twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
Today they  weigh 23% less.
 *****

Beauty of a Woman -

The beauty of a woman
Is not in the clothes she wears,
The figure she carries
Or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman
Must be seen from her eyes,
Because that is the doorway to her heart,
The place where love resides.

The beauty of a woman
Is not in a facial mole,
But true beauty in a woman
Is reflected in her soul.

It is the caring that she lovingly gives
The passion that she shows,
The beauty of a woman
With passing years - only grows.
 *****

An English professor wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on
the blackboard and directed the students to punctuate it correctly.  The men
wrote: "Woman, without her man, is nothing."   The women wrote: "Woman!
Without her, man is nothing."
*****

The Images of Mother -
4 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mommy can do anything!
8 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mom knows a lot!  A whole lot!
12 YEARS OF AGE  ~ My Mother doesn't really know quite everything.
14 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either.
16 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned.
18 YEARS OF AGE  ~ That old woman? She's way out of date!
25 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.
35 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.
45 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about it?
65 YEARS OF AGE  ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.

Please send this to five phenomenal women today in celebration of Women's
History Month.  If you do, something good will happen...  You will Boost
another woman's self-esteem.

Hi Sally,

I need to be working on my newest project, for which we went to Hallettsville
this week, and tomorrow is Garden club, and I am almost through as president.
 I will not preside in April, as I have a conflict-new secretary in Colonial
Dames and then all we have left in Garden Club will be our May luncheon.
Being presdent has not been too bad, as all of the ladies are very helpful.
My project is the completion of our papers for the recognition of our
cemetery by the State Historic Commissson .    That is why we were in
Hallettville.  Hope to get that done by Tuesday-there are many attachments
necessary.  We stayed in a Bed and Breakfast, which was fair but not
oustanding breakfast. I ran by to see Dot for a few minutes before we headed
home.  Mary had spent Sunday night with us to go with us and we met our
cousin from Missouri City also.

Enough of that, this will be a great quick way to communicate.  I am glad
Cindy gave me your address.  Hope you have had a great week-end.  I will
write more another time.

Love,

Mom (almost signed it Sue)

Hi!

Thought about calling you this weekend but thought since you had been gone
most of the week I'd let your family have you all to themselves.

Did want to let you know I am changing jobs week after next.  Will be going
to viviance new education.  They are out of Switzerland.  I, of course,
will work for their N.A. subsidiary.  They are small, with other offices in
ITaly, France, UK, Spain, and Germany.  My passport is ready!

Check them out:  http://www.viviance.net

Will forward new work number to Patti when I am sure of what it will be.
Our offices are on 6th Street on the 2nd and 3rd floor of an old
building...will ride the bus...

Talk to you soon. Hope Canada was cool and your family is doing great.

cindy

Hi, Sal.   Just talked with Cindy and she said you're still trying to work
out weekend plans.   I want to reiterate that, although it would be great to
have you here, please don't make it too hard on yourself.  Don't pressure
yourself to come; I will totally understand if you do not.   If you don't
come this weekend, I bet you will be here soon anyway - because this tummy
is sure to erupt in the near future!    Either way is great.

Just had to go get some more clothes (at Motherhood)  . . . since I am
carrying all of my weight in my belly, it has expanded to epic proportions
and I cannot fit into my pants!

Set up the baby bedding this weekend - it looks really cute!    But I
couldn't figure out what do with the mattress pads (what do the cords fit
around?)   Instead I put that cottony thing with the netting on as a
mattress pad.   Is that what it is for?    I know you explained all of this
to us in December, but we could not take it all in at that time!    love, c.

Ok--being the one that probably doesn't really have the dollars to do this I
would still say "yes"----will try to make room on a credit card for
this--have until June so I think it is ok.....

Will call the picture lady tomorrow and see what the price would be for
that--will email you the results.

Sista Cindy

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed "17" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara

Hi, Sal.  Just saying hello.  Hope your interviews at OU went well.   You
are quite the interviewing queen!  Maybe you should write a book (or
article) sometime on "Keys to Snagging the Right Employee!".

Good news about Dad, huh?   So glad you were able to get him to see your
doctor to start the ball rolling on finding new answers for him.   It is a
lot of work to find the right answers for our healthcare!

We are starting to think more about the baby's room . . .  I think we're
leaning towards using your bed, if that's still okay.   Did you say that the
changing table would be available, too?  Is it light wood also?
I think we will probably get our own bed linens - but what do your look
like?   Boyish?   Do you think it's better to use a rocker or a glider?

Sorry we didn't make it for a fall trip.   It seems that almost every
weekend one of us has been gone - Chris leaves for Asia on Thursday for 2
weeks - it's a nonstop whirlwind of travel!

Thanksgiving should be fun . . . what shall we bring?     Is there any sort
of a plan for Friday?

I had my monthly doctor's appointment today:  the baby is still in there and
her mom is getting very fat!

I have really enjoyed my Halloween nutcracker this season!      Love, Cara

Future NCL Queens,
 Attached are my REVISED suggestions regarding your office and things
relating to hours and awards.  I am attempting to gather my ideas at the end
of my reign and pass them to the appropriate incoming queens.  I have spoken
with some of you regarding these things and given some of you a rough draft
of my suggestions. What you do with these suggestions is between you and the
incoming hours queen, Lady Linda Christy.  Some of these things have been
done, some haven't. I am sending these with Queen Mum's (Pam Stone)
blessing. She has seen the rough draft and asked that the revised go
directly to the new queens.
The incoming hours queen may have input also.  Questions?  Ask.
The soon to be retired hours queen,
Sarah

Sally,
Hope all is well with you guys.   I am excited about our father-daughter
outing to ENRON FIELD later this month.  I understand that there is a person
at Enron who coordinates these events for us.  If you would not mind, would
you give me the person's name.
Eric is in the Boy Scouts and this sounds like an outing that would be
interesting for them also.
Thanks,
Andy
