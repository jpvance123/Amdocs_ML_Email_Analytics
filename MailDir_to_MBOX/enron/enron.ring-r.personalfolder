Nick,

I spoke to Narshima about this deal.  EESI would be bid at $46.00/MWD for Unforced Capacity Credits for Cal02.  Are you asking if we would have a bid for the energy as well?  If so, I would need to know the specific location for this generator (i.e. what point does this energy enter the PJM system).

Regards,

Richard

Richard,

Did Narsimha have a bid for 20 MW of Unforced Capacity Credits in PJM for Cal02?  My customer would like to sell this as well as energy.  I need to show him a price this morning.  Nick

I wanted to give all of you an update on the process of switching accounts from financial to physical, and a data collection effort to provide necessary information to facilitate this process.

Financial to Physical Switching

I will be working with Operations and Services Managment to better define this process over the next couple of weeks, in the meantime, here is the interim process:

Develop a list of accounts that are currently being served financially that you want to switch to physical service.  Include at least the account name, account number, and utility name.  Please screen the utility name to make sure that we are capable of physically serving that utility within the next 45 days.  Be aware that customer contractual obligations or utilty tariff rules may substantially delay our ability to serve the customer physically.
Send this list of accounts to David Salley in Services Management, copy me and Scott Massey on the email.
David will review the accounts for contractual obligations and other necessary information and forward to Jay Bhatty in Operations.
Jay will perform the necessary steps to send the request to CSC.
CSC will create the DASR (Direct Access Service Request) and send it to the appropriate utility to initiate the switch to physical.

Customer Data Collection Project

I have asked Services Management to undertake a data collection process on all our existing accounts.  Scott Massey is responsible for this effort.  The primary purpose of this it to identify all of our accounts and to have enough information to make economic decisions on switching customers from financial to physical.  This data collection project has been combined with a P&L project begun in Illinois.  The attachment below describes this project in more detail and includes the data to be collected.

Please copy me on any further requests for existing customer data so that we can eliminate duplicate requests.

Thanks,
Jeff

Narsimha/Michele,

Thanks for helping us with this index product issue.

We were initially planning to use an East Hub index with a basis of all uplifts, but Gillian and I agree with you on the advantages of using an index of PJM LMP zonal prices including all uplifts.  The product will certainly be more comparable to BGE's standard offer pricing, and it will eliminate the basis risk that you would have had with the East Hub index product.  A BGE zone index product will also eliminate the price comparison issues we had due to congestion.  

Based on today's discussion we will modify the design of the BGE index product proposal to reflect a pass-through of LMP BGE zone prices and uplifts.  The basis for this product would simply be deal costs and origination margin.

Gillian and I will work with Berney's group on changes to the TC, and a modified Product Approval Template will be routed soon.

Thanks again,
Bob

Good to hear from you and I'm glad to hear you and Andy are OK.  You should
really look into the Progress (Florida Progress & Carolina Power & Light)
opportunity--I'd be all over it if not for this opportunity.  Looking for
structuring at all levels (wholesale & retail-full reqs. deals esp.).  Esp.
for Andy they are attempting to jump start a gas business (I think they
recently bought pipe too!).  Duke would love your combined years in as well.
Call Johaan Dahl at 800.979.8701 x1153 to scheck out his opps--his web site
may have more info.  And remeber Rich, I got all my offers of MONSTER.COM
(great resume writing resource as well...)  Lemmee know if I can help, we'll

Gents

Apparently there is another group (EFS) doing DSM projects making assumptions about what the desk will pay for these "negawatts". They are contacting Richard Ring on the desk to get pricing information. Do you know about this and how these guys would utilize the process in your shop for defining value?

There's a mtg. tomorrow w/ Dan Leff to discuss this.

Confused??

Richard,

In response to your question re: how the VA cogen deal affects the supply contract with the GSA, I have prepared the attached analysis.  Part I focuses on the cogen deal; part II shows the affect of a new DSM project I'm trying to close by end of December.  Please note that this analysis is a back of the envelop analysis that gives you a logic and scope which can now be fine tuned by the appropriate analyst group.

The net result is that the existing cogen deal and the proposed new energy deal provides the EES commodity desk 67mm kWh it can market as Negawatts.  Based upon assumptions from Enron On Line, the market value of these negawatts is $1.5mm.  EFS will be happy to discuss with the desk how we can share this benefit.

Bill

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)
?         Press the # key
 
REVISED DIAL STRINGS FOR ENRON TIE LINE NETWORK

Nick,

I spoke to Narshima about this deal.  EESI would be bid at $46.00/MWD for Unforced Capacity Credits for Cal02.  Are you asking if we would have a bid for the energy as well?  If so, I would need to know the specific location for this generator (i.e. what point does this energy enter the PJM system).

Narsimha,

Couple of other time periods that Nick Politis is asking about:

"I have a couple of other time periods for this same customer.  They are naturally long and I think I could work something out if you guys are natural buyers.  The other 2 periods are: Jun-Dec02 (starting one month later than your last quote).  The other period is the PJM planning year Jun02-May03.  The amount could be higher if that works for you guys.  Let me know if you want to do more than 100 MW and I will see what I can do."

Any interest and at what level?

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

I'm still holding on by a thin thread here in Portland, but I wanted to send you my vitals as I'm experiencing advanced symptoms of the travel bug. Needless to say, you're one of the major reasons I have no regrets about having worked at Enron. Definitely stay in touch.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage or on the parking waitlist you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

Enron Energy Analyzer
 Unnecessary-or inefficient-energy use eats into the bottom line. 
But companies can't cut out the waste until they understand where and why it's happening. 
Enron Energy Analyzer is a service that lets companies view, analyze and 
compare-online-energy demand, usage, weather conditions and other 
energy-related information, across individual facilities and equipment, and company-wide 
as well. Energy Analyzer also allows benchmarking of energy performance 
versus comparable facilities and equipment.  To learn more, click here.

The purpose of this memorandum is to communicate changes in how EES operates and manages remote office space outside of Houston, London, Calgary, and Toronto.  The goal is to increase the effectiveness in the handling of all components of EES leases; in particular, driving enhanced communication, centralization and documentation, and increased accountability.

In keeping with this goal, the following procedures and signing authority have been developed and are in place effective immediately.  All leases, renewals, extensions, or modifications may only be signed by Dan Leff, Chief Operating Officer.

All leases, renewals, extensions, modifications, build-outs, expansion of space, or requests for furniture and equipment require prior review and approval by the following:

I.	Real estate and legal approval: Lance McCarthy, Manager - Real Estate.

II.	Sign-off by one of the following from EES Space Management:
	a.	Evan Hughes, Sr. Director - Services Group
	b.	Deborah Arango, Director - Service Operations, or 
	c.	Dawn Fournier, Director - Space Management

Our Real Estate Group shall not commence any lease negotiations without the prior consent of one of the three identified in II. above.

Sub-lease arrangements between EES and other Enron businesses will be formalized through a Memorandum Agreement prepared and negotiated by our Real Estate Group.  The same approval process as setout above applies.

Complete office inventories will be conducted once a year through a designated administrator who will be held accountable to manage space requirements and inventory.

Please contact Deborah Arango (ext. 3-4256) or Dawn Fournier (ext. 5-8291) if you have any questions or comments regarding this communication.

Thank you.

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Jay here is the comparison(s) you asked for.  Please note that November is not completed however, I contacted the NYISO to get access to the web page so that I could pull the monthly actuals.  I was told that Richard Ring could give me a userid and password to access this information.  I left a voice mail with Richard, as soon as I have access, I will complete November and forward it to you.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me at 5/3091.

Black dot is what I would need.  The two concerns I have is shaft flex (I would actually prefer steel shafts) and the price (I'm broke).  I appreciate your willingness to work with me but even though your price is fair, I simply can't afford it.  Let me know how much you would be willing to come off but I have to warn you even if you ask $600 it would be hard for me to come up with.
Thanks again for keeping me in mind.

The Ping I-3's are black dot.  New Ping I-3's with steel shafts are $699.00 and used Ping I-3's are $500.00 - $550.00.  If you have any interest at all I would be willing to work with you on price and/or payment terms.

Andrew,

Ping I-3 oversize, graphite shaft, reqular flex.  The regular flex in Ping graphite shafts are pretty firm.  I have 3 thru pw, all in excellent condition.  If you have any interest we can talk about the price but my first inclination is that the price would be similar to the price for a new set of Ping I-3 oversize steel shaft (approx $700).

Hi richard,
can you find out or have michele find out as much as we can about obtaining FTRs and the various issues regarding that... with regards to.. time lines and logistics and our rights as LSEs.
It is becoming more and more apparent that we could save a lot of money by physically serving the load that we have in PJM if we get FTRs allocated to us. As a part of the new auction that the Jersey utilities are having we might be able to get some things done that might not have been possible as an LSE ... like getting FTRs from locations that we choose and such...
I would like to see if we can start puting pressure on them next week...if we can get our information gathering done this week then we will be in shape to meet with our govt affairs people maybe next week.. if we have to.
Also as a side note... any information on how we can request capacity for the transmission that we requested 15 to 20 days ago for 2004???

thanks.

Thanks for that, I have a couple of other time periods for this same customer.  They are naturally long and I think I could work something out if you guys are natural buyers.  The other 2 periods are: Jun-Dec02 (starting one month later than your last quote)
The other period is the PJM planning year Jun02-May03.  The amount could be higher if that works for you guys.  Let me know if you want to do more than 100 MW and I will see what I can do.  Nick

I spoke to Narshima about this deal.  EESI would be bid at $46.00/MWD for Unforced Capacity Credits for Cal02.  Are you asking if we would have a bid for the energy as well?  If so, I would need to know the specific location for this generator (i.e. what point does this energy enter the PJM system).

Super Bowl Party!

When:		Feb 3rd at 3pm, the game starts at 5pm
Where:	16319 Hickory Point Rd

What:		Bring something to drink and optionally your favorite dip

Fish, Potato Salad and Fun in abundance.


The perfect combination will take place on Feb 3rd at the Bledsoe residence.  We are combining a Fish Fry with the big game.  Due to the fantastic fishing the past few months the freezer is full of Trout and Redfish and it's time to make some room for the excellent fishing coming up in the next few months.  Please RSVP via email or call 281-855-4252 so we have an idea of how much fish to cook.  

Looking forward to seeing everyone and having fun with the football and commercials!

A Message from the Editor

The audience for EREN Network News is truly international,
and we received a flood of sympathetic comments over the
past week. A warm thanks to all who touched us with their
responses. Sympathies arrived from Germany, Italy, France,
Poland, Pakistan, India, Israel, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Australia, Canada, Columbia, and Cuba. It's a good reminder
that the people of the United States do not stand alone.

Today's "Energy Fact and Tip" focuses on the energy
impacts of last week's attack, but the remainder of our
newsletter returns to its standard format.

Also, today's newsletter was delayed due to concerns about
the "Nimda" computer worm. We apologize for any
inconvenience.


California Power Authority Pursues 1000 MW of Renewables

The new California Power and Conservation Financing
Authority, which has the mission of ensuring a reliable power
supply for the state, has announced its intentions to acquire
1000 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy capacity by
next summer. The Power Authority is currently negotiating
with 14 parties, representing mainly wind and biomass projects,
to supply the needed capacity. See the September 17th
press release on the Power Authority's Web site at:
<http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/MediaRelease/main.asp>.

The Power Authority is also requesting bids for fuel cells
systems, microturbines, and solar photovoltaic systems.
See: <http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/Requestforbids/main.asp>.

Governor Gray Davis has set a goal of providing 17 percent
of the state's electricity supply from renewable energy
sources, which the authority estimates will require 3,000 MW
of new renewable energy capacity over the next five years.
See the Background section of the Power Authority Web site
at: <http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/background/main.asp>.


New Hybrid System to Power Honda Civic in 2002

A hybrid electric version of the Honda Civic will be available
in the United States in 2002, and it will use a new, improved
hybrid gasoline-electric system as its power source. The new
system combines Honda Motor Company's newest lean-burn
4-cylinder engine with a more powerful motor, a more
efficient battery, and a smaller power control unit than are
used in the Honda Insight. The system also shuts down
three of the four cylinders when decelerating, cutting the
engine's compressive braking in half and allowing more
energy to be captured via regenerative braking, which
charges the battery. The result of all these features is a gas
mileage of about 68 miles per gallon, according to Honda.
The company expects to mass produce the new Hybrid
Civic, which will seat five. Although the vehicle will be
available in Japan in fall of this year, it won't be sold in the
United States until spring 2002. See the Honda press
release at:
<http://world.honda.com/news/2001/4010904.html>.

Honda also debuted its latest fuel-cell-powered car, the
FCX-V4, early this month. This latest experimental model
has a top speed of 87 miles per hour and, thanks to a high-
pressure hydrogen storage tank, can travel 186 miles
between fill-ups. Honda worked to make this model more of
a "real" vehicle by including luggage space and safety
features and even designing a user-friendly display for
monitoring the fuel cell and energy storage system. The
company still maintains that its goal is to introduce a
production fuel cell vehicle in 2003. See the Honda press
release at:
<http://world.honda.com/news/2001/c010904_1.html>.


Home Depot Starts Selling Residential Solar Power Systems

Some energy experts have said that the solar energy
industry won't be truly successful until the average consumer
can walk into The Home Depot and buy a solar power
system. Well, that day has arrived -- in San Diego,
California, at least. AstroPower, Inc. announced in early
September that three of The Home Depot's stores in the
San Diego area are now offering the systems. The Home
Depot is providing a full-service program that includes
financing, installation, and service of the solar power
systems. See the AstroPower press release at:
<http://www.astropower.com/homedepot_release.htm>.

Combined with last month's announcement about residential
solar energy systems from Green Mountain Energy Company
(GMEC), the AstroPower announcement suggests that solar
energy may finally be achieving mainstream acceptance in
the United States. See the GMEC announcement in the
September 5th issue of EREN Network News at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/sept05_01.html>.

Need to know more about the status of solar electric power?
UPEx'01, the Photovoltaic Experience Conference and
Exhibition, is coming to Sacramento, California, with
sponsorship by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and
the Solar Electric Power Association (SEPA). The
conference will be held as originally scheduled, from
September 30 through October 4. For more information, see
the SEPA Web site at:
<http://www.solarelectricpower.org/upex/default.cfm>.


Organic Molecules May Yield Inexpensive Solar Cells

Producing solar cells may one day be as simple as applying
a liquid to a sheet of plastic and waiting for the cells to
"assemble" themselves, according to researchers at the
University of Arizona. The liquid will be composed of organic
molecules that will collect on the plastic surface in a way that
forms a very organized coating. If the researchers are
successful, that coating will be able to efficiently convert
solar energy into electricity. If the difficult task of creating the
right organic molecules succeeds, the simplicity of the
production process could result in low-cost solar cells. The
research is partially funded by DOE's National Renewable
Energy Laboratory. See the story by selecting "Science &
Research" in the header of the university's news page at:
<http://uanews.opi.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UANews>.


Stateline Wind Project Gets Green Light in Oregon

The Stateline Wind Project, a 300-megawatt wind project
that straddles the border between Washington and Oregon,
has received approval for construction from the Oregon
Energy Facility Siting Council. Due to concerns about
impacts on the Washington ground squirrel, which is listed
as an endangered species in Oregon, two strings of turbines
had to be eliminated from the Oregon side of the border.
FPL Energy is already constructing the project on the
Washington state side. See the council's announcement at:
<http://www.energy.state.or.us/siting/announce.htm#Stateline>.

For more information about the Stateline Wind Project, see
the project Web site at: <http://www.statelinewind.com/>.


DOE Awards $30 Million for Bioproduct Technologies

DOE announced on Monday that it will award $30 million to
11 projects that will develop technology to  produce
chemicals, plastics, materials and other products from plant
matter and other natural waste materials. These so-called
"bioproducts" save energy while reducing the use of
nonrenewable resources such as petroleum. The 11 projects
will be carried out over the next three to five years, and
cover the range of processes from harvesting to final
product. Funds will also establish university education and
training programs in the area of bioproducts. See the DOE
press release at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/seppr/pr01157.htm>.


DOE Funds Seven Projects to Improve Reciprocating Engines

Natural-gas-fired reciprocating engines are one of many
technologies that are currently being used for on-site
generation of power in homes and businesses. To improve
the efficiency of these engines, DOE is investing $3.6 million
in seven research and development projects. The projects
will also seek to lower costs and emissions from the engines.
See the DOE press release at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/seppr/pr01158.htm>.

Honda Motor Company, Ltd. announced in late August that it
is preparing to test a home unit in Japan that produces
power, heat, and hot water using a natural-gas engine.
Systems that produce both heat and electricity are called
"cogenerators." The Honda cogenerator will produce one
kilowatt of electricity and three kilowatts of heat, converting
85 percent of the energy in the natural gas into either heat or
electricity. See the Honda press release at:
<http://world.honda.com/news/2001/p010830.html>.

ENERGY FACTS AND TIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Power Outages, Rebuilding, Increased Energy Security,
and Isolated Price Hikes Follow Terrorist Attacks

One of the impacts of last week's terrorist attack on the
World Trade Center was the loss of electrical service to
lower Manhattan. Two electrical substations next to the
Trade Center were totally destroyed and a third substation
was knocked out of service. Major electrical transmission
cables were also lost. As of this morning, the city's electric
utility, Con Edison, had managed to restore power to all of
lower Manhattan after installing more than 33 miles of new
high-voltage cable. However, the utility is still asking people
in lower Manhattan to minimize their use of electricity. More
than 1,900 Con Edison workers have labored around the
clock to restore power. See the Con Edison press releases
at: <http://www.coned.com/about/about.asp?subframe=news>.

In response to the attacks, security was heightened
throughout the U.S. energy infrastructure. Shipments of
nuclear material were halted and security was heightened at
nuclear plants, refineries, pipelines, and along the electricity
transmission grid. Taking a longer view, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) noted that the electric, gas,
and oil companies that it regulates may need to adopt new
procedures, update existing procedures, and install facilities
to further safeguard their systems. FERC announced that it
will approve applications to "recover prudently incurred
costs" for such actions and will expedite any such requests.
These costs will presumably be passed on to consumers.
See the FERC announcement at:
<http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/MISC/PL/PL01-6.000.TXT>.

Fears of supply disruptions apparently led some U.S. gas
stations to hike their prices to as much as $5 per gallon.
DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham announced on the day
after the attack that such price hikes were unjustified, and
asked consumers to call the DOE Hotline (1-800-244-3301)
to report such incidents. See the DOE press release at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/seppr/pr01155.htm>.

As of Monday, DOE's Energy Information Administration
(EIA) reported that U.S. petroleum prices were generally
holding steady. See the price summaries (particularly for
retail gasoline) on the EIA Web site at:
<http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/info_glance/prices.html>.

See also the EIA's assessment of oil markets from the day
after the attack, under "Featured Topics" on the EIA home
page at: <http://www.eia.doe.gov/>.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Deb - Richard is out today.  Could you please locate a spot for him and notify Tina.  Deb - also, if Liqun Pan, Oliver Jones and others have already moved to ECN 6 and still have phone lines and computers in ECS 5 you may want to forward their info (locations - old and present) so that they can be included on this churn as well. 

Thanks everyone,
Rogers

Below is a news release issued this morning.  PJM announced a partnership with
Comverge Technologies and a program that provides small energy producers a

For Immediate Release
WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS SMALL
ENERGY PRODUCERS NEW METERING OPTION 

(Valley Forge, PA - September 6, 2001) - PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.,
administrator of the world's largest competitive wholesale energy market and
operator of the electric grid for the mid-Atlantic region, and Comverge
Technologies, a global data communications company, today announced a program
that provides small energy producers a low-cost, secure wireless connection to
PJM's information systems.

PJM and Comverge Technologies have formed a partnership to create systems to
allow direct communication of metered information from small energy producers
(100KW to 10MW) using wireless cellular technology. These energy producers,
which include renewable sources such as windmill, solar and small hydro
facilities, may not have been able to fully participate in PJM's markets because
of the capital equipment costs and investment in communications infrastructure.
In addition to the lower costs, small energy producers will benefit from the
"instant-on" capabilities of the wireless communications network that allows for
rapid deployment of new customer connections.

 "PJM's partnership with Comverge Technologies supports our goal to continually
strengthen our technological capabilities so we can offer more choices to our
market participants," said Phillip G. Harris, PJM President and Chief Executive
Officer.  "This program will allow for greater participation in the mid-Atlantic
region's energy market."

"PJM's commitment to increasing reliability and advancing technical solutions
such as the Comverge Distributed Connection for distributed generation
monitoring and dispatch is critical to advancing in the changing energy
marketplace," said Frank Magnotti, Comverge President.

The technology consists of interfacing the customers' revenue meter at the
customers' site with the Comverge Distributed Communications device
communicating over a cellular network, then securely through the Internet into
the master supervisory control and data acquisition system at PJM. Some of the
benefits for the user include: non-proprietary hardware/software interfaces;
industry standard protocols; economic equipment and communications costs;
multiple suppliers for customer equipment; rapid deployment; and modular
approach. The technology allows PJM to communicate with a broad range of
external customers and combine the acquisition of real time and revenue
information into one system. In short, the program simplifies the complex task
of interfacing to external customer equipment.

PJM, the country's only fully functioning regional transmission organization,
operates the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and one of
North America's largest power grids. The company currently coordinates a pooled
generating capacity of more than 58,000 megawatts and operates a wholesale
electricity market with more than 200 market buyers, sellers and traders of
electricity. PJM has administered more than $5 billion in energy and energy
service trades since the regional markets opened in 1997. More than 70 nations
have sent delegates to PJM to learn about the market model and the operation of
the grid in the mid-Atlantic states. Visit PJM at www.pjm.com.

Comverge Technologies, a subsidiary of Data Systems & Software Inc.
(NASDAQ:DSSI), is the "new power in power technologies" providing over 5000 MW
of peak load reduction to over 450 energy companies worldwide. Comverge provides
end-to-end, two-way communication solutions including automated meter reading,
utility and/or customer controlled appliance cycling, outage detection, load
profiling, home automation, environmental monitoring and distributed generation
monitoring. Comverge is headquartered in Florham Park, NJ, with offices,
research facilities, representatives and agents around the world. For more
information visit Comverge's website at www.comverge-tech.com. In addition to
the energy product solutions business conducted through Comverge, DSSI is a
provider of computer consulting and development services, and is an authorized
direct seller and value added reseller of computer hardware.

Introducing a product that will help Massachusetts customers compare apples to apples. The 
Fixed Price with Congestion Pass-Through product is comparable to products being offered 
by our competition, but with a twist. With Enron, customers will not be put back on 
default service once the congestion management system comes into effect in 2003. 
They will continue paying a fixed price for generation, with the congestion portion of 
the bill reflecting current market pricing. To learn more, click here .

Hello Victor,  
 
My name is Vini Adenwala, I'm doing some research for Narsimha Misra and Richard Ring for the East Power Risk Mgmt. Dept., and I wanted to ask you  for some information regarding our customers in Massachusetts.  I have a list of contracts here:

1. Polaroid Corporation
2. Quebecor Printing USA Corp.
3. Simon Property Corp.
4. Sonoco Products Co.
5. Lucent Technologies Inc.
6. Haverhill Police Station
7. BICC General Cable Industries, Inc.

What I need to get from you is a customer list along w/ their account #'s for each of these contracts, and Richard told me you were the person I should talk to.  If you could provide me with a list of the individuals responsible  for billing each account, or even the customer acct. #'s themselves, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for your time and cooperation.

Regards,

Vinay Adenwala

George 

Here is the information on the Golf Tournament.   In the past three years we have raised over $187,000 benefiting Texas Children's Hospital Bone Marrow Transplant Unit through His Grace Foundation (HGF). HGF supplies gift baskets, meals, parking, and other services (laundry, grocery shopping, banking, post office, etc?) to patients and their families, including several Enron families in the past.  

Hopefully you will considering playing in and sponsoring a team in our 2001 tournament.  Let me know if you have any questions or need any more info. 

I have included a registration form as well as a flyer with more tournament details. 

Hope to see you on the Green!

Jim Coffey, Jr.

Narsimha,

Couple of other time periods that Nick Politis is asking about:

"I have a couple of other time periods for this same customer.  They are naturally long and I think I could work something out if you guys are natural buyers.  The other 2 periods are: Jun-Dec02 (starting one month later than your last quote).  The other period is the PJM planning year Jun02-May03.  The amount could be higher if that works for you guys.  Let me know if you want to do more than 100 MW and I will see what I can do."

Any interest and at what level?

I'm still holding on by a thin thread here in Portland, but I wanted to send you my vitals as I'm experiencing advanced symptoms of the travel bug. Needless to say, you're one of the major reasons I have no regrets about having worked at Enron. Definitely stay in touch.

Electricity Is Not Cyclical!

* A reminder, electricity demand is non-cyclical
In 35 years, electricity demand has decreased in only 1 year,
despite 5 years of negative GDP growth.
* Industrial demand is only about 30% of total US electricity
consumption
And has fallen from about 40% of total consumption in 1980.
* Unregulated power should not trade in sympathy with cyclical energy
Inside we show the volatility in natural gas & oil consumption vs
electricity demand stability. Further, shortage supply conditions,
L-T sales contracts & wholesale market growth differs.
* What will get unregulated power up and running again?
A supportive FERC decision on El Paso's affiliate ruling,
visibility on '02E EPS in 3Q01, stabilizing natural gas prices,
and industry consolidation. Favorite names are MIR & CPN.

Guys

This is the list of customers sent by Richard Ring. Let's cross check his list with a list that you guys can generate by querying the following utilities:

Public Service Electric & Gas Co.
PECO Energy Company
PPL Electric Utilities
Baltimore Gas & Electric Co.
Pennsylvania Electric Co. (GPU)
Metropolitan Edison Co. (GPU)
Jersey Central Power & Light Co. (GPU)
Potomac Electric Power Co.
Delmarva Power & Light Co. (Conectiv)
Altlantic Electric Co. (Conectiv)

This may be overkill since Richard has identified only physical customers behind PECO.

Thx

Berney

Berney & Dale,

The attached spreadsheet indicates the fifteen (15) accounts in the PJM Control Area that EESI currently delivers physical power to.  The fifteen (15) accounts are all behind PECO Energy Company.  Most of the contracts were "commodity only" deals that have expired, with the exception of American College which expires 01/31/2002.  

The other accounts are behind bundled outsource deals (i) Simon Properties (Cheltenham Shopping & SDG Macerich Properties) and (ii) Suiza Foods (Lehigh Valley Dairies) and (iii) Prudential Insurance Companies.

Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Richard

In our continuing effort to provide security and stability to the revenue-producing systems here at EES, we would like to ask for your assistance with a few items.  In general, we want to ensure that all business critical systems are clear from the risk of downtime, which could negatively impact the business.

So, what does this mean to you?  We need to make sure that any computer programs and files you use to do your job are protected and reside in an environment that is controlled by the IT infrastructure group.  This serves several purposes, including:

Ensuring that everything business critical is backed up properly and can be recovered if a workstation's hard drive fails.
Ensuring that specialized programs like Cobra or BSOC or RPS or RGS which are business critical can easily be installed on any workstation by the IT group.  This will help keep the business up and running if you have to switch workstations suddenly.

Specialized applications - If you use any special program to do your work, such as WinAT or some other database, analysis, or special utility tool, the IT infrastructure group should be made aware of it so that they can learn how to install and maintain it.  This way, if an elephant sneaks into the office one night and steps on your computer, we can build out another workstation, install the specialized programs on it for you, and deliver it to you so that you can continue to do your job.  Please contact Christine Nguyen at (713) 345-8459 if you think your computer application is not currently maintained by IT.

Files: Spreadsheets, Excel macros, MS Access databases, and the like - Please make sure that any spreadsheets or MS Access databases you use for the business are not stored on your local computer drives.  These files should be stored on a network-shared drive (in general, something other than C or D drive).  That way, if that elephant comes back another night, we could get you another workstation from which to operate without losing any of your valuable work.

Web sites - If you are responsible for maintaining a web site that is business critical, including those used by inside as well as outside customers, we need to make sure that this web site is hosted on one of the fault-tolerant redundant web servers provided by IT infrastructure, and not running on a laptop tucked away under your desk.  This will help keep the web site available to those who need it in the event of power outages, server failures, and other unforeseen hardware-related problems.  Please contact Larry Hack at (713) 345-5783 if you think your web site is not currently maintained by IT.

Your support with this effort is greatly appreciated.

If you could provide me with a list of the individuals responsible  for billing each account, or even the customer acct. #'s themselves, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for your time and cooperation.

	Dear Elliot,

	How are you?  You may remember that we met last fall when you came
to SOM for on-campus recruitment.  At that time, I successfully completed
the first round of interviews with you and Dwight, but unfortunately I was
unable to attend the second round.

	I graduated this May and am currently looking for a full-time
position starting as soon as possible.  I am very interested in talking with
you about current or future job openings at Enron.   I have already received
a couple of job offers in my home country (Venezuela) and one in the U.S.,
and I am also aware of the difficult market conditions right now.  However,
I have decided to take the time to find the most challenging position
available. 

	Please let me know when might be the most convenient time to call
you.  I have attached my resume for your review.

	Thank you, Elliot.


	Best Regards,

	Oscar Stefani

fyi...There is a scheduling fee that needs to be added to the deal costs...and just for my curiosity what is the reason why the customer would switch to us instead of staying with the incumbent utility with this product??? isn't this exactly the SO product being offered by the utility without the origination margin???

Narsimha/Michele,

Thanks for helping us with this index product issue.

We were initially planning to use an East Hub index with a basis of all uplifts, but Gillian and I agree with you on the advantages of using an index of PJM LMP zonal prices including all uplifts.  The product will certainly be more comparable to BGE's standard offer pricing, and it will eliminate the basis risk that you would have had with the East Hub index product.  A BGE zone index product will also eliminate the price comparison issues we had due to congestion.  

Based on today's discussion we will modify the design of the BGE index product proposal to reflect a pass-through of LMP BGE zone prices and uplifts.  The basis for this product would simply be deal costs and origination margin.

Gillian and I will work with Berney's group on changes to the TC, and a modified Product Approval Template will be routed soon.

Thanks again,
Bob

The articles below provide excellent commentary on what we are up against. =
 Whether we like it or not history is littered with fallen empires and nati=
ons who have persecuted the Jews.  Israel, unlike us, at least until now, u=
nderstands that it is in a war; a war for it's very survival; a war against=
 those who openly state that they do not consider Israel to have the right =
to even exist.  But we know from the Bible that Israel will always exist an=
d those who help the Jews, God will bless and those who hate the Jews, God =
will punish.  And even though we don't always agree with what Israel does, =
they are our friends, they know how to fight, and they are our allies in th=
is War.
=20
Israel knows they are in a fight for their very existence.  The same enemy =
of the Jews hates America.  They hate America and the West for the very rea=
sons outlined in the article below.  They are and have been openly at war w=
ith us for years.  Every American better understand that now! And if we don=
't have the best intelligence service and the best armed forces in the worl=
d we are going to continue to pay dearly.  Several years before World War T=
wo, MacArthur, while Chief of Staff of the Army, stated that there was noth=
ing more expensive than a cheap army.  We can expand that today to include =
all aspects of national security to include an intelligence apparatus neces=
sary to penetrate enemy organizations.  The additional challenge we face is=
 in curbing the never ending desire for bigger and stronger government at t=
he expense of freedom.  Can we as a people vote in statesmen rather than po=
liticians to fill the ranks of government?
=20
But above and beyond all of this is the fact that the Christian (those who =
believe in Jesus Christ - "faith alone in Christ alone" - for salvation) mu=
st understand that Jesus Christ does control history and no matter what hap=
pens on the historical scene He will take care of us both in life and in de=
ath.    With that said, we need to make sure that as many of these terroris=
ts as possible meet "allah" very soon.

Subject: Worth a read (if you have time)

An interesting debate by folks that know far more that I about middle east =
stuff.  M/ Petit and Charlie are both former analysts with one of our secur=
ity organizations and offer interesting insights.  If you are in the mood, =
worth a read (start on the bottom article)...DLS=20
 =20


Comments by M/ Petit:=20
In response to several articles and comments I have received:=20

Regarding the original article, I disagree with one of the points.   Jews w=
ere originally treated decently for a while within Islam.  As was women, un=
til the Arabs encountered the tradition of purdah in India. Mohammed incorp=
orated the Jewish prophets and have Jesus as one of  his prophets.=20

As to comments that our relationship with Israel is the basis of this confl=
ict, I disagree.   There is a perceived cultural divide on the part of the =
fanatical Muslims.  The West is more representative of the devil's evil way=
s.  We are to them to the pagans that Christian missionaries sought to conv=
ert.  However, conversion to Islam is usually done under the sword.  And it=
 goes deeper.  We have defeated the Islamic forces when we have engaged the=
m.  And the Israelis have also done so.  The defeats have been so thorough =
as to be humiliating.    =20

Israel must perceive itself as being independent.  Politically their leader=
 never could accept direct orders from another state.  But, note, one of th=
e first countries to offer sympathy and support was Israel.  =20
Note one thing.  Arabs started the slave trade.  Swahili is the language of=
 the Arab slave traders with their African business partners.  African Musl=
ims were buried in a separate section in a Muslim cemetery.  Farrakan and h=
is followers wake up.=20

Pakistan has declared it would support the US with permitting overhead flig=
hts.  The Afghanis are flooding out of their country.  The Afghan leaders a=
re announcing that they are safe, don't worry.  The bottom line is that eve=
n the Afghanis under the Taliban know who will win.=20
We have won the first skirmish in the War Against Terrorists.=20

M/Petit=20

-ubject: Re: Article on the Cause of the Attack=20

Interesting historical presentation - good food for thought - I also refer =
you to page A-28 of the 15 September 2001 Washington Post.=20

Bush requests Shaon get on with talks with Arafat - Sharon says shove it up=
 your nose - is this a positive thinking member of the western world?  We s=
end $4B a year to Israel to protect them as a nation and assist in keeping =
them in the "modern" world - It never hurts to talk to your adversaries -  =
even if you talk while fighting.  The current disaster poses an opportunity=
 for both friends and allies to understand U.S. power.=20

Thoughts?=20

Hesperophobia=20
On blaming the Jews.=20
Mr. Derbyshire is also an NR contributing editor=20
September 13, 2001 5:00 p.m.=20

 =20
Back in 1982 there were some horrible massacres at two Palestinian refugee =
camps in Lebanon. Christian Lebanese Arabs actually did the killing; but th=
e Israeli army was in the neighborhood, and was responsible, at some theore=
tical level, for keeping the peace in the zone that included the camps. Bec=
ause of this, the Israelis took much of the brunt of the world's outrage at=
 the killings. Commenting on these events, the Israeli Prime Minister, Mena=
chem Begin, remarked in disgust: "Goyim kill goyim, and they blame the Jews=
!"=20
I've been getting the same feeling from some of my e-mail. The fundamental =
reason America is under attack by Arab terrorists, several dozen people wan=
t me to know, is that the U.S. supports Israel. And the only reason we do t=
hat, several of them have said, or hinted, is because of the political powe=
r of the Jewish lobby here in the U.S.A. A few of my correspondents have ex=
pressed themselves more ... bluntly than that. Put it this way: While I hav=
e not yet encountered the word "bloodsuckers" (perhaps my readership isn't =
"diverse" enough), some of this stuff comes pretty close - though I should =
say in fairness, most is argued on cold national-interest grounds. At any r=
ate, a lot of people feel that the mass killing of Americans by Arab terror=
ists is all the fault of Israel and those American politicians who, for low=
 and disreputable motives, or from sheer blindness to America's true ideals=
 and interests, support her. Goyim kill goyim, and they blame the Jews.=20
Setting aside the statistical certainty that some of the dead Americans are=
 Jewish (as, in high statistical probability, some were of Arab origins), a=
nd at the risk of yet more ill-tempered or abusive e-mails, I am going to d=
eclare that I don't think these recent outrages can be blamed on the Jews, =
nor even on pro-Israel American politicians. The root phenomenon is not Ame=
rican involvement in Middle Eastern affairs: The root phenomenon is hespero=
phobia.=20
This word was coined by the political scientist Robert Conquest. Its roots =
are the Greek words hesperos, which means "the west" and phobos, which mean=
s "fear," but which when used as an English suffix can also carry the meani=
ng "hate." Hesperophobia is fear or hatred of the West. [While I'm in the c=
lassical stuff, by the way, I committed a breach of good manners in my last=
 posting by inserting a Latin tag without translation. I am sorry. Oderint =
dum metuant means "Let them hate us, so long as they fear us." Seneca rebuk=
ed Cicero for saying it, though it seems to have been current among educate=
d late-republican Romans.]=20
Here is the news: A lot of people out there hate us. The name "Durban" mean=
 anything? In China, in India, in Pakistan, in Indonesia and Malaysia, in A=
frica, and in the Arab countries, European civilization - the West - is wid=
ely hated. Matter of fact, quite a lot of Europeans and Americans hate it, =
too, as you will know if you spend much time on college campuses.=20
I can't see any strong reason for believing that if the state of Israel wer=
e to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow, hesperophobia would dis=
appear with it. Not even just Arab hesperophobia would decline. A common wo=
rd for Europeans in the Arabic language is feringji, from "Frank," i.e. cru=
sader. Arabs don't hate us because we support Israel. They hate us because =
we humiliated them, showed up the gross inferiority of their culture. To th=
em, and similarly humiliated peoples, we are the other, detested and feared=
 in a way we can barely understand. Things got really bad in the 19th centu=
ry. When European society achieved industrial lift-off, Europeans were sudd=
enly buzzing all over the world like a swarm of bees. They encountered thes=
e other cultures, that had been vegetating in a quiet conviction of their o=
wn superiority for centuries (or in the case of the Chinese, millennia). Wh=
en these encounters occurred, the encountered culture collapsed in a cloud =
of dust. Some of them, like the Turks, managed to reconstitute themselves a=
s more or less modern nations; others, like the Arabs and the Chinese, are =
still struggling with the trauma of that encounter. Neither the Arabs nor t=
he Chinese, for example, have yet been able to attain rational, constitutio=
nal government. For a devastating look at the paleolithic condition of poli=
tics and society in the Arab world, I strongly recommend my colleague David=
 Pryce-Jones's book, The Closed Circle <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/A=
SIN/0060981032/qid=3D1000382845/sr=3D1-12/ref=3Dsc_b_12/103-0202540-1179008=
/nationalreviewon>.=20

The 1991 Gulf War showed how little has changed since those first encounter=
s. Here were the armies of the West: swift, deadly, efficient, equipped and=
 organized, under the command of elected civilians at the head of a robust =
and elaborate constitutional structure. And here were the Arabs: a shamblin=
g, ill-nourished, shoeless rabble, led by a mad gangster-despot. (That was =
their Arabs. There were also, of course, our Arabs - the Kuwaitis and Saudi=
s, cowering in their plush-lined air-conditioned bunkers being waited on by=
 their Filipino servants while we did their fighting for them.) Final body =
counts: the West, 134 dead, the Arabs, 20,000 or more. The superiority of o=
ne culture over another has not been so starkly demonstrated since a handfu=
l of British wooden ships, at the end of ten-thousand-mile lines of communi=
cations, brought the Celestial Empire to its knees 150 years earlier. The C=
hinese are still mad about that: They are still making angry, bitter movies=
 about the Opium Wars. A hundred and 50 years from now, the Arabs will not =
have forgotten the Gulf War.=20
If you haven't spent some time in its company, the depth, and bitterness of=
 hesperophobia in these cultures is hard to imagine. As Thomas Friedman poi=
nts out in today's New York Times, Palestinian suicide bombers do not targe=
t yeshivas, synagogues, or religious settlements. They go for shopping mall=
s or Sbarro's outlets. Sure, they hate the Jews, but they hate the West as =
much, or more.=20
Israel is not a cause of any of this, except to the degree that Israeli cul=
ture is essentially Western. If the present state of Israel were inhabited =
by Christian Lithuanians or Frenchmen, the hatred would be nearly as intens=
e. Nearly, not completely: Hatred of the Jews has been built into Arab-Mosl=
em culture since the time of Mohammed. There is a tale you will hear from A=
rab apologists that the Jews were contented and well treated in the old Ara=
b-Moslem empires. This is nonsense: More often than not, they were treated =
like swine. For a true account, read Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial <ht=
tp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963624202/qid=3D1000384153/sr=3D1-1/r=
ef=3Dsc_b_1/103-0202540-1179008/nationalreviewon>, or Gil Carl Alroy Behind=
 the Middle East Crisis</a>. From the Arab point of view, Israel, or any We=
stern state on "Arab land," is an outrage, an illegitimate creation, a crus=
ader state. The fact that the Jews had a wealthy and powerful nation on tha=
t land three thousand years ago counts for nothing. Israel is, from the poi=
nt of view of most Arabs, an alien graft that must not be allowed to "take.=
" It is a reminder of what can barely be thought of without acute psychic p=
ain: the squalid, hopeless, irredeemable inferiority of one's own culture b=
y comparison with another.=20
So, so, so, is this any of America's business? What are we doing, meddling =
in the Middle East? Where is our interest? Well, U.S. politicians must spea=
k for themselves, but if I had any position of authority in any Western nat=
ion, I would be urging full support for Israel, and I am not Jewish. (Follo=
wing my Passover column <http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshir=
e041001.shtml>, in fact, a lot of NRO readers, along with at least one ex-e=
ditor of The New Republic, believe I am an anti-Semite.) It's a matter of c=
ultural solidarity. We of the West must hang together, or else we shall han=
g separately. American isolationists simply do not understand how much we a=
re hated in other places.=20
What, after all, does the Buchananite program offer us, if carried through?=
 We have no troops in Israel to be withdrawn. If we withdraw our aid, the I=
sraelis will be less able to defend themselves against the Arabs. Should we=
 just let the free market take over, U.S. arms manufacturers selling weapon=
s to them cash on the nail? Apparently not: Several of my correspondents ha=
ve explained to me that what so enrages the Arabs is the sight of their peo=
ple being killed "by American weapons." Oh. No weapons, then (and presumabl=
y we should try to repatriate the ones they already have - lots of luck wit=
h that, guys). But if we don't arm the Israelis, who will? While other hesp=
erophobic countries - China, for example - are gleefully arming the Arabs a=
nd other Israel-haters like Iran, and pocketing the profits?=20
And the end of it all will be ... what? Inevitably, without our support, it=
 will be the destruction of Israel. They are so few, and the Arabs so many.=
 The Arabs will overwhelm that tiny state, and there will be such an orgy o=
f massacre as has not been seen since the Rape of Nanking. And we shall be =
doing ... what? Watching it on our TVs, with a six-pack and a bucket of Nac=
ho chips in hand? That's the Buchananite vision? If so, it is a vision of c=
owards and fools, and I want no part of it.=20
Israel's culture is ours. She is part of the West. If she goes down, we hav=
e suffered a defeat, and the howling, jeering forces of barbarism have won =
a victory. You don't have to be Zionist, nor even Jewish, to support Israel=
. You don't have to be in the pocket of the Israeli congressional lobbies, =
or a suck-up to "powerful pro-Zionist interests." You don't have to pretend=
 not to notice the occasional follies and cruelties of Israeli policy. You =
don't have to forget about the U.S.S. Liberty or Jonathan Pollard. You just=
 have to think straight. You just have to understand that the war between c=
ivilization and barbarism is being fought today just as it was fought at Ch=
alons and Tours, at the gates of Kiev and Vienna, by the hoplites at Marath=
on and the legions on the Rhine. It is, as you have heard a thousand times,=
 this past few days, a war; and the thing about war is, you have to take si=
des, and close your eyes to your allies' imperfections for the duration. Th=
ere isn't any choice. What happened this week was not, or not only, an act =
of anti-Americanism, anti-Israelism, or anti-Semitism. It was in part all t=
hose things: but more than anything else, it was an act of hesperophobia.=

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

> RECORD HIGH ELECTRICITY DEMANDS
> Thanks public for conservation efforts
>
> (Valley Forge, PA - August 10, 2001) - With a six-day heat wave ending, PJM
> Interconnection, LLC, the electric grid operator for the mid-Atlantic region,
> today recognized the great efforts taken so the company could supply a week of
> record-breaking electricity demands.
>
> "This week's accomplishment is testimony to how effective markets and
> efficient operations work in harmony to reliably serve the electric customer,"
> said Phillip G. Harris, president and chief executive officer. "We greatly
> appreciate the conservation steps taken by the public and for the support from
> PJM's members, especially the generation owners who provided outstanding
> performance, as well as state commissions and agencies."
>
> Harris paid special tribute to PJM employees, who worked tirelessly to ensure
> a reliable supply of electricity to the more than 22 million customers in the
> mid-Atlantic region. "Our ability to supply the record-breaking electricity
> demand is a reflection of our talented, dedicated staff." Harris noted that
> PJM's employees train, through simulation programs, for all types of
> circumstances, which include the situation encountered this week.
>
> The area's intense heat wave drove system-wide electricity use to successive
> all-time records -54,176 MW Thursday, 53,910 MW Wednesday and 53,464 MW
> Tuesday. This week's electricity peak was more than 2,400 MW higher than the
> peak experienced during the July 1999 severe heat wave.
>
> To maintain the region's electric supply in time of historic demand, PJM first
> took steps that had the least impact on electricity customers. During periods
> on several days this week, the company activated programs that included:
> curtailment of industrial customers through incentive programs; implementation
> of its pilot demand-side response program; request for back-up supply at
> commercial locations; and request for voluntary curtailment at industrial
> locations. On Thursday, the company directed its members to institute "voltage
> reductions" - which equated to about a 2 to 3 percent decrease in electricity.
> These electricity reductions, which are generally undetectable to the user,
> assisted PJM in maintaining overall reliability of the region's electric grid
> during its peak on Thursday.
>
> PJM, the country's only fully functioning regional transmission organization,
> operates the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and one
> of North America's largest power grids. The company currently coordinates a
> pooled generating capacity of more than 58,000 megawatts and operates a
> wholesale electricity market with more than 200 market buyers, sellers and
> traders of electricity. PJM has administered more than $5 billion in energy
> and energy service trades since the regional markets opened in 1997. More than
> 70 nations have sent delegates to PJM to learn about the market model and the
> operation of the grid in the mid-Atlantic states.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Sung to American Pie

A long, long time ago.... I can still remember, how that stock price used
to make me smile, and I knew if I had my chance, I shouldn't have listened to
those analysts rants, and maybe I'd be happy for a while..... but February
made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in theBoardroom,
I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside, the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...
CHORUS
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink Bud
Dry.
Did you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff above,
if the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can mark
to market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal
flow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the
credit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears. He
was a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I was
out some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...
Chorus

Now for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the dole
but that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George and
Barb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and while
Skilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the
shareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of
jack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff
stepped aside. We were singin...
Chorus
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter the electricity market was a limit
melter, eight hundred bucks and climbing fast, California credit limit had
quickly past, the governor tried to get some bills past,  Enron's
receivables have quickly amass, now everyone ran to  in Washington, the
lawsuits have just begun, just before the price would fall, Gov. Gray
bought it all, as the dust is settling, will prove that government mettling will
certainly be, a huge catastrophe, the day, Jeff stepped, aside. We started
singin...
Chorus
Oh and there we were all in one place, a company that needed its space with
no floors left to grow, so come on, Jeff be nimble, Jeff be quick, Jeff S.
built a new deodorant stick because hubris the devils only friend, oh and
as I watched that tower build, but I doubt it will ever be filled, no more
recruiting trip; as HR doles out more pink slips; and as the building
climbed high into the sky to quite the contractor delight  I saw
shareholders shuttering with fright, the day, Jeff stepped aside. He was
singin...
Chorus
The burning question that I don't know is who can replace him as CEO cause
the company won't be the same, he transformed the industry his success is
plain to see but from natural gas to electricity, Dynegy tried, and  Duke
has dreamed but I hate to tease, they are just Enron wanna-be's, and in
hindsight its easy to mock his leaving the firm in a shock, I'm just I had
sold my stock, the day, Jeff stepped aside, and they were singin...
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink Bud
Dry.

FYI

This is a presentation I went to last week lead by Elliot Mainzer (Portland office) who is working with a team of people to establish a centralized Renewables book.  The attached presentation has some good information on the Renewables market, and their group is available to support our transactions as needed.	  Just something to keep in mind.

Thank you very much for attending the Renewable Power Meeting in Houston last week. I hope I was able to convey a sense of the opportunities across the country. I will be circling back with you over the next several weeks to discuss some specific transactions and to solicit recommendations for ways in which our groups can best collaborate. I have attached the PowerPoint slides from the meeting.

Kenron's business is to create value and opportunity
for its senior management. We 
do this by combining our employees' personal financial
resources and restricting the 
flow of information to the market  to create
innovative accountancy solutions to 
challenge the US financial regulations. We are best
known for our lack of respect 
and truthfulness and single minded ambition to stray
from our core competencies of 
natural gas and electricity products into all kinds of
unprofitable markets and hair 
brained ventures. 

Today we offer vast diversified product range, 
including office space in many major 
US and European cities, second hand computer
equipment, and useless IT Helpdesk 
promotional gimmickry. In fact we have the largest
stock of nearly new Compaq and 
Sun computers in the world. These products give
customers the flexibility they need 
to lose all their money and achieve into the highly
sought after status of suing our ass 
in a class action. 

It's difficult to define Kenron in a sentence, but our
senior executives have been 
described as "incompetent", "arrogant" and " a bunch
of thieving bustards" by many 
top tier financial institutions. We falsify commodity
markets so that we can deliver 
physical commodities to our customers at a
ridiculously unsustainable price. It's 
difficult, too, to talk about Kenron without using the
word "screwed." Most of the things 
we do have never been done before, like going from a
market capitalisation of 
nearly $90 billion to $199 in the space of a year!!!!
We believe in the economic 
benefits of secret, underhanded insider trading, and
we play a leading role in ripping 
off our investors. We initiated the  wholesale
bandwidth markets in the United States, 
and we are helping to build similar markets in Europe
and elsewhere. Shame we 
lost billions in doing so :-( 

Every day we strive to hype up our share price to
unrealistic highs, with the sole 
purpose of suckering the investor community and lining
our own pockets. Our passion 
has enabled us to completely mismanage risk. No wonder
Misfortune Magazine 
surveys have named Kenron the most innovative company
in America for six years in 
a row. Our emloyees think Kenron is such a wonderful
place to work, thousands are 
leaving every day to spread the word around the world.


Knron's four business units -- Wholesale Services,
Energy Services, Broadband 
Services and Transportation Services -- ARE NOW
CLOSED.

We are pleased to announce that EES, FieldCentrix and a group of outside investors have formed a new company to be referred to as The Facility Services Group.  This group is charged with creating a national service network to provide predictable and scalable repair, maintenance and other facilities services for retail customers, including many of EES's existing and future customers.  The Facility Services Group is expanding its vendor management platform to allow service technicians to focus on efficient, predictable service while capturing data on a real time basis and will provide scalable execution capability for the vendor management and O&M products.  We expect these products and services to create significant value.

The Facility Services Group includes Enron Building Services, Inc. (EBSI), The Linc Company, the HVAC Services business (all three, formerly part of Enron Facility Services), Interactive Process Technologies (IPT) and FieldCentrix, Inc., a mobile workforce management software company.  The Management Team of the Facility Services Group will include existing management from these companies.

FieldCentrix is a leading provider of wireless, Internet-based field force automation software.  Founded in 1994, the 125-employee company was recently named one of Frontline Solutions Top 100 companies and also received the Cingular Best Solution award for 2001.  The Facility Services Group will use the FieldCentrix and IPT platforms to provide a superior predictive and preventative maintenance program through vendor management to customers.  Tracy Price, President and CEO of FieldCentrix, will lead The Facility Services Group.  

The remaining components of Enron Facility Services (EFS) will be re-organized into The Construction Services Group.  This group will be led by Steve Wurzel and will include: Limbach Facility Services, the Architecture & Engineering group and the Construction Management Services group.  The Construction Services Group will continue to provide Engineering and Construction Services to Third Parties and EES.  We expect this group to continue to be an important and valuable part of EES's financial performance.

Dave Whaley will continue to manage the shared services groups, including legal, finance, HR, and IT, across The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services Group.  The centralization and sharing of these support services is cost effective, scalable and responsive.  In addition, Dave will assist in the transition of the EFS companies to The Facility Services Group.

Joe Earle has decided to leave Enron at the end of this year.  Until then, Joe will continue to work with the line businesses and assist with the transition of the EFS companies to The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services group.  Under his leadership, EFS and all of its companies have continued to be leaders in their fields.  Please join us in thanking Joe for his 10 years of leadership with the EFS companies.  
The re-alignment of our activities and the creation of a new entity to focus solely on serving the $136 billion facility services market will assist our entire organization in achieving our 2002 and beyond goals and objectives.

Introducing a product that allows customers to create revenue 
using their emergency power generators.

Many Enron commodity customers have emergency power generators that normally sit idle. But with our new 
Dispatchable Generation Program, our customers can turn their power generators into revenue generators. Enron 
monitors the wholesale power market, and when prices spike, we notify our customers to operate their on-site
generators. The power they generate displaces a portion of the load we would normally supply. We then 
sell that displaced power on the wholesale market--where the prices are high--and share the revenue 
with the customer. Want to learn more? Click here .

Net Generation Year-to-Date 2001

During the first 4 months of the year, total U.S. net generation of=20
electricity was 1,214 billion kilowatthours, 2.3 percent more than=20
the amount reported during the corresponding period in 2000.  More=20
than half (53 percent) of the generation was produced by coal-fired=20
plants.  This was followed by 20 percent from nuclear, 14 percent from=20
gas, 6 percent from hydro, 4 percent from petroleum, and 2 percent from=20
other renewables.

Net Generation and Utility Retail
Sales-April 2001

Net Generation.  Total U.S. net generation of electricity was 282=20

April 2000. Electric utilities generated 200 billion kilowatthours=20
(71 percent of the total) and nonutility power producers generated=20
82 billion kilowatthours (29 percent of total generation).  At=20
utilities, fossil fuels (primarily coal) accounted for 73 percent=20
of net generation, followed by 19 percent from nuclear, and 8 percent=20
from renewable resources (including hydro).  At nonutilities, fossil=20
fuels (primarily coal) accounted for 68 percent of total generation,=20
followed by 21 percent from nuclear, and 11 percent from renewables=20
(including hydro).

Utility Retail Sales. Total sales of electricity to ultimate consumers=20
in the United States were 255 billion kilowatthours, 8 billion=20
kilowatthours (3 percent) more than the amount reported in April 2000.
The residential sector had sales of 83 billion kilowatthours, 10=20
percent more than the amount reported in April 2000.  Retail sales=20
in the commercial sector were 6 percent higher while sales in the=20
industrial sector were 5 percent lower than amounts reported a year=20
ago.

Utility Fuel Receipts, Costs, and
Quality-March 2001

Coal. Receipts of coal at electric utilities totaled 64 million =20
short  tons, down 5 million short tons from the
level reported in=20
March 2000.  The decrease from the prior year level is due partly=20
to the sale and reclassification of utility plants as nonutility=20

Service Electric & Gas Company of New Jersey.  In addition, data for=20
the Tennessee Valley Authority was not available at the time of=20
publication and is not included in this report. =20

Petroleum.  Receipts of petroleum totaled 10 million barrels, up=20
nearly 6 million barrels from the level reported in March 2000. While=20
the sale and reclassification of plants has reduced fuel oil receipts=20
over the past year, this increase in petroleum receipts is due partly=20
to utilities switching from natural gas to a less expensive fuel oil=20
as a replacement fuel. Also, the increase in consumption of fuel oil=20
during December through February required some rebuilding of stocks.=20
The average delivered cost of fuel oil was $4.20 per million Btu, up=20
from $4.03 per million Btu reported in March 2000.

Gas.  Receipts of gas totaled 142 billion cubic feet (Bcf), down from=20
191 Bcf reported in March  2000.  The average cost of gas delivered=20

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Subject:=09Court Decision on NOx - EPA Section 126 Rule
Importance:=09High

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the=
 EPA Section 126 Rule.  (As brief background, the 126 Rule would have requi=
red compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2=
003 in several northeast and Midwest states)

The Order states: =20

"It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerato=
rs, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric genera=
ting units ("EGUs") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one th=
ird of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid =
for sale per year."   Translation:  This part of the order appears to "vaca=
te" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW=
) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.   For all other cogen=
erators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with =
some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.   Im=
pact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, =
so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units. =
  EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.

"It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's de=
cision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicab=
le to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution o=
f the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court."  Translation:  T=
his more significant part of the order "tolls" -- or puts on hold -- compli=
ance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA r=
esolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2=
001 ruling.    =20

Impact:  The practical effect of this part of the order will be to delay im=
plementation of the Section 126 Rule until May 2004, when the EPA's NOx SIP=
 Call regulation is scheduled to go into effect.   The EPA will not be able=
 to re-issue its Section 126 rules in a time frame that would require compl=
iance before May 2004.  The NOx SIP Call would have supplanted the Section =
126 Rule in May 2004 anyway -- what this ruling does is take away some of t=
he uncertainty that existed for the May to September 2003 period (original =
effective date of the Section 126).   This means that generators in states =
not covered already by existing NOx trading programs (OTR NOx program) will=
 have another year to comply.

I will forward any more detailed legal analysis as I receive it, but this i=
s the latest news.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

Introducing a product that lets New York customers turn their 
energy load flexibility into a revenue opportunity.

Enron can turn energy usage flexibility into revenue for our customers. When a customer chooses Enron's product, 
they receive monthly payments in exchange for reducing their energy usage at Enron's request. Requests are made 
when energy market prices are high, so the energy the customer doesn't use can be sold on the market at a premium. 
Bad time for the customer? No problem--they can choose not to reduce usage, and pay a 
"buy through price" to Enron instead. Want to learn more? Click here .

Narsimha,

Good point, and the key is that BGE's standard offer includes a $7 "retail adder" to the market-based price.  This retail adder was part of BGE's settlement agreement.  To the extent all of our deal costs (including a scheduling fee) and origination margin are notably less than $7, then customers will be better off under our index product.

Bob

fyi...There is a scheduling fee that needs to be added to the deal costs...and just for my curiosity what is the reason why the customer would switch to us instead of staying with the incumbent utility with this product??? isn't this exactly the SO product being offered by the utility without the origination margin???

Narsimha/Michele,

Thanks for helping us with this index product issue.

We were initially planning to use an East Hub index with a basis of all uplifts, but Gillian and I agree with you on the advantages of using an index of PJM LMP zonal prices including all uplifts.  The product will certainly be more comparable to BGE's standard offer pricing, and it will eliminate the basis risk that you would have had with the East Hub index product.  A BGE zone index product will also eliminate the price comparison issues we had due to congestion.  

Based on today's discussion we will modify the design of the BGE index product proposal to reflect a pass-through of LMP BGE zone prices and uplifts.  The basis for this product would simply be deal costs and origination margin.

Gillian and I will work with Berney's group on changes to the TC, and a modified Product Approval Template will be routed soon.

Thanks again,
Bob
