After continuing to play musical chairs with the west eol products, I think 
we have decided on a plan.  Keith and Frank will handle the prompt and term 
basis.  This includes the monthly basis, daily basis, and gd index for SJ, 
ROX, Scal, CG, and Malin.   They will make certain that the gd index products 
are out there for all terms.  Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.

I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the 
index points.  The term physical index will be coming soon.

The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the 
next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to 
Monique's GD BOM products.  I would like to get the cash products out on eol 
by 7:15 each morning.  The early info will come in handy as we approach 
winter.  Let me know what you think.   Steve and Matt have started a pilot 
program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 11:00 am 
each day.  We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.

We are in the process of sending out the "odd lot" notice to our customers 
regarding all products on eol.  We will change our product minimum to one 
mmbtu in the next week.  You may want to discuss this with your direct 
customers before the mailout.    

With the addition of Olivia Newton-John to my Scour selection, it is no 
secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.  If you review 
your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't 
contacted in some time, then call them and visit.  We will be using EOL and 
the brokers for physical volumes, but nothing beats the direct phone call for 
the baseload phys.

Thanks,

Mike

My broker called me this morning and asked me how I was doing and I told him  
again that I was coming to New York and he said no problem with getting 
tickets to Avita and the Lion King.  Easter next year is Sunday April 15.

price increments which a customer can specify)
 - "Allowed"  box is ticked under the "Orders" section
 - The Max Volume in the "Orders" section is set where you want it.

If you do not do this, customers will not be able to place Price Limit Orders

I wanted to share with you the growth in gas demand for electric generation 
over the past cuple of years in California.  Maybe I can make a believer out 
of you.

Also just wanted to thank you for being so honest with me the other day.  I 
know it was difficult and I am sorry that  I never made it easy on you to 
express your true thoughts.  Maybe I just chose to ignore them for my own 
selfish reasons.

Jane,

you need to submit a request via the eRequest system.  (itcentral.enron.com)

Search for west power under "applications" and select general access, 
just note that you're in west gas.

That should do it.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

Jane, Southwest Gas shorted ENA  $16,386.19 for liquidated damages they claim 
occurred in November (see email below).  I have not received the support from 
SWG but have asked them to fax me a copy.  How would you like me to handle?

Enron incurred $16,386.19 in Liquidated Damages for the month of November.  I 
mailed a copy of them to your attention on 12/26.  Most of the fallouts were 
due to CPR and PRR which means Enron failed to perform their obligation to 
supply gas.  Nancy

Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical 
volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are 
different than non-EOL trades.  They stated that they reveiwed the EOL 
contract and that it does not address payment.  I told them that the payment 
terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.  Can you 
send them something.

This date works for me so I will assume that Julie will be going.  I will 
work on flight  arrangements for Julie and I unless you think you might be 
going.  I need your help in determing what equipment needs we need.  Call me 
at 35539 or respond to this memo.

Jane: 

It looks like the Oct 31st works for most people here that would have a stake 
in this proposal.? I have set-up a meeting starting at 8:30 to 11:30 am.? Let 
me know if that works for you or if we need to adjust.? Also let's discuss 
any equipment needs you might need such as a data line for access to Internet 
and any audio video equipment so I can have it arranged.?? Hotels in the area 
are: The Biltmore, The Westin Bonaventure and The Intercontinental Hotel all 
within one block of our building.? I believe at the Biltmore we have a 
special rate if you mention that its for SoCalGas.

I'll be telecommuting tomorrow so you can reach me at my cell phone at (213) 
248-4053. 

Thanks very much

Jane, I still have two discrepancies with Southwest Gas which I need your 
help in resolving.

1.  SWG says price on Sitara 518455 Day 7 should be $9.50 instead of $9.55 - 
You have already confirmed with me that the price should be $9.55.  I 
forwarded your email to my contact at SWG and she responded with the email 
below.  Could you please call SWG trader Mark Anderson so that this can be 
resolved?

2.  On Sitara 386140 SWG says trigger is calculated on physical, not 
scheduled, volume - You have already confirmed with me that the trigger is 
based on scheduled volume and that you feel SWG will not agree.  According to 
my contact at SWG, their trader Bill Brown confirmed with her that the 
trigger is based on physical volume.  Can you please call Bill so that this 
discrepancy can be resolved?

I appreciate your help in resolving these issues.  Although I have already 
forwarded your responses to Nancy at SWG, she is being very insistent that 
SWG is correct and is requesting that the traders resolve these issues.

Thanks again
Laurie

Please have her contact Mark Anderson our trader.  He assured me it was

Let's just say it's an accessory for your winter coat!  The cards are really

occasion. Hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving.

Janie:

Here is a summary of the new structure that we discussed for Harbor.  

1.  Each day we would call in our estimate of usage for the next day.  On 
friday we would  call in our estimate for Sat - Mon.

2.  The desk would bill us ON USAGE, not on deliveries or ordered.

3.  EPMI would pay the mid point of Gas Daily.

4.  EPMI would pay a demand charge of $.025/MMBtu based on a max DQ of 20,000 
MMBtu/d times the number

Let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will try to close the deal with 
the customer.  If you could call me back today that would be great.

In the final analysis, we did not make a lot of progress in reaching 
agreement to settle the RP99-507 proceeding on El Paso's capacity allocation 
proposal at the conference in San Francisco last week.

The parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of Burlington's 
concerns about timing.  We will  reconvene for settlement discussions July 12 
and 13 at Southwest Gas's offices in Las Vegas after comments and reply 
comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May 2 
technical conference at FERC.  Comments are due June 30 and reply comments on 
July 7.  Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September 21, 
1999, and requested fast-track processing under the Commission's new 
complaint procedures.  Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to 
the fast-track processing of the complaint, maintaining that an order should 
have been issued within 240 days (I don't know where they got that from -- I 
can't find any such requirement), and vehemently opposed any attempts to 
extend the procedural schedule.

The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris, representing the CPUC, 
was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by 1:30 (the meeting 
started about 12:30).  He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete 
opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June 6, and 
then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in 
violation of the '96 Settlement.  

After Harvey spoke, El Paso then reviewed its June 6 settlement proposal, 
which you received by e-mail, and provided some additional explanations of 
assumptions, etc.  Then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on 
their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss. 

Of particular note was the allocation of the 360 MM/d of San Juan-only 
capacity that El Paso proposed to take back from Burlington (97J4) and Amoco 
(97JB).  El Paso said that it had been allocated 106 MM to the Havasu 
shippers, 180 MM to the EOC shippers, and 74 MM to all others (California CD 
shippers).  This was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing 
discussions -- California shippers objected to EOC getting the lion's share 
of the additional San Juan capacity.  Under El Paso's proposal, EOC shippers 
would get 82% of their rights from San Juan and 18% from Permian, based on 
BDs.  CD shippers, on the other hand, get 61% and 39%, respectively.

EOC shippers pointed out that the BDs were not actually representative of 
their load.  BDs were simply a number negotiated among the EOC shippers to 
allocate the costs that were allocated between EOC and California in the '96 
settlement.  Certain EOC shippers suggested that their specified rights 
should be based on some other calculation, such as non-coincident peak day 
usage, rather than BD.

Another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers (FR 
shippers) be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the 
specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants (BD).  El 
Paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority 
superior to that of a CD shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm 
basis (either alternate receipt/primary delivery or alternate 
receipt/alternate delivery).  Of course, the FR shippers approved of the 
proposal but most other parties  objected to it.  Several suggestions were 
advanced to try to reach a compromise (for instance, limiting FR shippers to 
primary specified receipt point rights during Cycle 1 nominations), but none 
were accepted.  Most non-FR shippers stated concerns about the practical 
impact of giving FR shippers such a scheduling priority, particularly since 
El Paso's interpretation was that the FR shippers would not have to nominate 
any of their Permian specified rights in order to come back to the San Juan 
with  the systemwide rights.

Everyone pretty much agreed that El Paso's proposal for capacity release of 
receipt point rights (#4 in their write-up) was a non-starter.  It was put on 
the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that, if they 
could be made economically neutral to using non-San Juan points, they might 
be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights.  What they 
were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some 
further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive, stating 
that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case.

A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas doesn't 
consider El Paso's proposal not to sell Block II turned-back capacity to its 
Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they can't anyway.  
SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which 
it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCal/Topock.  However, SoCal Gas 
can't at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a 
specified right at Topock.  Conversely, all the other CD shippers who think 
they bought firm rights at SoCal/Topock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get 
all the rights unless they, too, can get out of their contracts.

Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point 
for certain parties -- some insist it has to remain in the settlement, others 
say there can't be a settlement if it stays in.  El Paso's proposal would 
move the fuel rate back to 4.85% effective 2/1/00 by changing the way they 
eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as 
gathering.  In the filing to be effective 2/1/01, the rate would go down to 
approximately 4.4% and then to 3.88% on 1/1/03.  Burlington insists they will 
opt out of the settlement if they don't get relief on fuel.  Apparently, to 
the extent El Paso doesn't include the costs of compressors that Burlington's 
gas utilizes in systemwide fuel, they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El 
Paso's gathering affiliate.  They say it has already cost them several 
million dollars (I heard numbers between $9 and $27 million -- no hard data), 
and they will not settle without getting something in return.  

After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday 
afternoon, Rick Miles, the FERC ADR facilitator, pushed for individual 
meetings between the various segments (EOC, California, producers, marketers, 
El Paso), based on several parties' representations that they were willing to 
continue talking.  A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took 
up the morning on Tuesday.  Just before lunch, the entire group got back 
together and accepted Mr. Miles' suggestion that each segment select three or 
four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the 
issues.  He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some 
understandings.  However, it apparently didn't work because he called us all 
back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion, where the positions 
outlined above were stated and restated.  Certain parties, when pressed, 
could not agree to certain basic principles because, they said, they would 
have to get input from others in their organization.  Mr. Miles expressed his 
frustration that parties were at the table who didn't know what their bottom 
line position was (e.g., SoCal Gas, Southwest Gas).  Following discussion by 
the producers, particularly Burlington, as noted above that they would not 
agree to an extension of the date for filing comments, the next settlement 
meeting was scheduled after the filing dates.  Mr. Miles requested that 
parties send him an e-mail note that would state their bottom line settlement 
position, which he would keep confidential.  He would review all the 
positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement 
package of his own.  He assured all that no one would be able to identify the 
individual positions from his package.

One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the 
pooling committee's report.  No one registered any complaints, although a few 
parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that 
they would like to participate.

 This is how I see our bottom-line position.  I would like to send it to Rick 
late this week if everyone agrees.

A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both 
market and supply with no restrictions on pool-to-pool transfers (loops 
allowed).
Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract, or, preferably, 
termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to 
others as part of a settlement.
Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point 
rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate 
delivery points, although no objection to using some allocation method other 
than billing determinants, such as peak day volume, to establish those 
specified point rights. 

Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCal/Topock rights?  Please 
give me a call when you've had a chance to look this over.  I'm sure you'll 
have some questions!  Also, we'll need to talk about what kind of comments we 
want to file.

RE: New York City
Looks like we leave Houston at 1:15 and get to New York at 5:52. We leave New 
York at 3:00 and arrive Houston at 5:49.  The phone number at the Barbizon 
Hotel is 212-838-5700.  Enron has a corporate rate there.  Suppose to be 
$222.00 Deb- if you want to try to get your own room-be sure to ask for the 
Enron Corp rate.

RE:  Europe.  There are several hotels in London which are listed as giving 
Enron corporate rates -prices range from $69 to 215.  The Ritz is $180.  I 
show no discounts for hotels in Paris.

Joe and I would love to attend the bowling party.  We would like to have 
prawns for dinner.  We are arriving on Friday at 1:30 so we shouldn't have a 
problem being there.

Does Joe need to being his suit for Saturday night?

Just wanted to let everyone know about the changes that will be made in the 
upcoming week(s) to the EPNG/Blanco/Blanco meter.  Currently, Blanco is an 
active pool facility that is traded by the West desk.  In order to allow the 
Deal Confirmations group to identify which trades require special handling 
language in the confirm, we have all decided to create a second meter with 
the same data reference number in Global Facilities.  Doing this will serve 
three purposes.  First of all, creating a second meter on the same data 
reference number allows users to see two separate meters in Sitara without 
affecting the way that physical location is nominated to the pipe since all 
they receive is the data reference number.  The change will also allow the 
Product Controls Group to create multiple products in EOL with different 
pricing terms on the same physical point.  In addition, it will temporarily 
resolve the issue the Deal Confirmation is currently experiencing in 
segregating the confirmations that need special language.    I will be 
creating a portfolio that will include all new trades done at both BLANCO 
meters which will be monitored by the Deal Confirmation group.  I will make 
sure to contact all of you once the meter change has become effective.  When 
the change is completed, expect to see the following locations available for 
selection in Sitara.

Pipe Zone  Meter   Product Description
EPNG BLANCO BLANCO EP Blanco 100%; use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - 2 Nomination Cycle       language". 

EPNG BLANCO AVGBLANCO RESTRICTED, use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - Operational Constraints       language".

Please call me if you have any questions.

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, "satisfactory", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=
d=20
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  =
In=20
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you ha=
ve=20
any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.

Just a little heads up. It is going to be so cold in Omaha next week.  Will 
probably hit around Tuesday.  Expect highs below zero.for about a week.. 
Better get your chores done this week because you are not going to want to go 
outside next week..  Haven't seen it this cold since 1983.. Will encompass 
the entire country.  Gas prices going through the roof.

Tenaska is billing us for demand fees on PG&E because we didn't take all the 
gas that we were suppose to.  The amount is $50,382.00.  They have sent me a 
spreadsheet.  If you need me to fax it, please let me know.  

Can you also retouch the deal?  The $1 differential is not being calculated 
into the price.

Thanks,
Shielah

Thank you for choosing Time Warner Road Runner as your high speed online
provider.  Your request has been received and it is currently being processed.
A customer service professional will be in contact with you within 48 hours.
While you wait, here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.

Q. If I am already a Road Runner customer what will happen to my account?

A. Your account will be transitioned to the new Enron billing system.  This
process is transparent to the end user.  The difference will be seen in your
monthly bill.  Keep in mind that there may still be prorated amount due on the
previous billing method.  Also, an account that is currently delinquent cannot
be transferred until the previous balance is paid in full.

Q. I?m not currently a Road Runner customer.  What is the process?

A. Your address will be checked to verify Road Runner serviceability.  If
serviceable, a customer service professional will contact you to set up an
appointment for a new install.  There are typically two time slot options a
customer may choose, 8am ? 12 noon or 1pm ? 5pm.

Q. Are there any installation charges?

A. All Enron customers will be charged a fee of $39.95 for a standard install
(network interface card not included).  Keep in mind that if you are getting
your computer through the Click at Home project, a network interface card is
already included.  A standard install is one that only required the installer 
to
run the cable to an outside wall.  There are extra fees for a network 
interface
card and running the cable between an inside wall.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=

new structure as described below.

Patti/Janie:

To recap the billing issue between EPMI and ENA with respect to the Harbor 
deal, as indicated on the attached spreadsheet, I believe EPMI ordered 
292,500 MMBtu at an average price of $4.65/MMBtu for a total of $1,360,125.   
Harbor Cogen used 288,574 MMBtu (this usage will be in the ENA SoCalGas 
imbalance statement).  ENA delivered 297,348 MMBtu in a pattern that resulted 
in a price above $4.65/MMBtu.  In the system right now, ENA is trying to bill 
EPMI 297,348 MMBtu at this higher price.  

So, there are two issues.  First, does Janie agree with my statement as to 
what EPMI bought, given that the Gas Daily arithmetic seems to be indicating 
a higher weighted average price than $4.65.   If not, let's get that on the 
table.  Janie could you let me know on that?  Secondly, how can we deal with 
this volume issue?  ENA can bill based on deliveries as this is how gas is 
typically sold.  ENA can bill based on usage as we do with accounts such as 
Jefferson Smurfit and Filtrol.  The concept of billing based on ordered is 
troublesome as if ENA were to try to bill on what EPMI ordered, this would 
make the imbalance calculation that Sherry A. does out of wack.    

So, to keep this simple, to address this volume issue on a go forward basis, 
an approach that might work is that ENA would bill EPMI on usage at the 
$4.65/MMBtu price (288, 574 @ $4.65/MMBtu).  And, it would be understood that 
EPMI would receive the first 3,926 MMBtu of August gas from ENA at a price of 
$4.65/MMBtu. This could easily be done by making a deal entry for a day in 
August that would adjust a price reflect the value of this imbalance.   This 
would be the way we would hanle it from now on.

Let me know what you think.

Teresa:  Irrespective of the above discussion, let's reduce Harbor's PX 
payment by $1,360,125 to reflect gas costs.  If we end up with something 
other than this we can catch it as a billing adjustment with the ISO 
payment.  

Thanks

Chris

Jane, I have a few issues with SWG per their email below.

1.  SWG says the price on Sitara 518455 (Day 7) should be $9.50 instead of 
$9.55.  If this is correct, could you please change the price in Sitara?
2.  On Sitara 386140, SWG says that the trigger amount should be calculated 
on the physical volume, not the scheduled volume.  Can you please let me know 
which is correct and adjust in Sitara if necessary?

Also, SWG will be shorting ENA $198,026.60 for liquidated damages on contract 
96003533.  Would you like me to fax the backup to Patti Sullivan as I did 
last month?

I have one last question for you on contract 96003533.  For November and 
December gas, SWG is paying on the last day of the month versus the 25th.  I 
checked the contract and it does confirm this information.  However, it is my 
understanding that SWG is a netout customer (they have been receivable only 
for quite some time).  I have checked with contracts and credit and cannot 
find a netting agreement.  Do you know if there is a netting agreement which 
might override the payment terms on this contract?  I have a $2MM dollar 
invoice with a 1/25 due date that they will not be paying until 1/31.

Thanks for your help
Laurie

1.  Detail was mailed to you on 1/15.  the amount on your invoice # 19861SA 
agrees in total except for line item 3 on page 1 of 3.  The price should be 
$9.50 instead of $9.55 per Mark Anderson of our purchasing dept.

2.  The credit you applied on your inv # 19838SA is incorrect per Bill 
Brown.  The price was triggered at $4.74 on scheduled volume received.  Nancy

On the trigger, our system calculates as follows:

NX1 (Jan 2000)  $6.016
Trigger price               - $5.180
Trigger credit  $0.836

Trigger credit            $0.836
Scheduled volume       x465,000
Credit to invoice  $388,740.00

Southwest Gas is saying that the trigger credit should be on the physical 
flow, not the scheduled volume.  Can you please advise.

Thanks
Laurie

As part of an effort to facilitate communication on the trading floor, we 
have set everyone up with Microsoft Messenger.  
For those of you not familiar with the program, Microsoft Messenger allows 
you to talk real time with anyone on your contact 
list.  The program also has voice capabilities if you have a microphone.  
Messenger should now be fully installed on your 
computer and is accessible from the Start Menu.

You will need to set up a Hotmail account in order to use this service.  
Please follow the link below to set up your account. 
Once you have created an ID, please email me back with your ID so that I can 
compile a contact list for everyone on the floor.  
Let me know if you need help getting set up.

A word of caution when using the program.  Because this is not behind the 
company firewall, anything you send is not 100% secure and 
could be intercepted by a third party.  Any sensitive pricing information 
that you do not want disclosed should not be transmitted over
the program.

As per our conversation about penalties to Southwest Gas, the Sitara deal # 
is 538767. It is a sale to Southwest Gas for 10,000 a day at 12.50. On 
Sunday, January 21st, they failed to nominate the gas for cycle 1, Since TW 
Needles was full after the first cycle, when the gas was nominated for cycle 
2, only 191 flowed. We need to send them a penalty invoice for the remaining 
volume of 9,809. Please send a copy to Janie and myself when this has been 
done. If you have any questions or if I can help in any way, please call me 
at ext. 30494. Thanks for your help.

Janie,

 I have been talking with EES and they have confirmed their volumes for their 
purchases from ENA (I believe that it is Zarin who comfirmed their volumes on 
their side).  I need you to confirm and verify our volumes and to change them 
(or contact who can change them) if needed.  I am trying to get EES to pay us 
for these transactions and they will not if they do not agree.  The amount 
that we are talking about is over $10 mil.  Could you please look at this so 
that I can get this resolved today?  The following shows what we are out:



Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks...

This is not going to get resolved.  They disagree with our view and are not 
going to pay on scheduled volumes.  However, we are not going back off our 
view and will continue to bill based on scheduled volumes.

We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from 
Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced 
trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going 
forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.

Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for  
southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index 
will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there 
as soon as possible.

Let me know when they have been changed.

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=
ls=20
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20
being implemented:
a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=
et=20
and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and=
=20
Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm=
an=20
(EA OOC).  This team will have one income statement, one book and a joint=
=20
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=
se=20
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=
=20
the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=
te=20
origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=
=20
provide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team wi=
ll=20
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20
Eastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU=01=
,s,=20
muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP=01,s and will utilize all ENA=01,s pr=
oduct=20
capabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital. The team wi=
ll=20
further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business unit=
s=20
including:=20
  (i) ERCOT =01) managed by Doug Gilbert Smith and Bruce Sukaly;
  (ii) NE =01) managed by Dana Davis and Jeff Ader;
  (iii) Midwest =01) managed by Fletch Sturm and Ed Baughman;
  (iv) SE =01) managed by Rogers Herndon and Ozzie Pagan;
  (v) East Power Development =01) managed by Ben Jacoby;
  (vi) East Power Structuring  - managed by Bernie Aucoin; and
  (vii) East Power Fundamentals and the =01&Genco=018 =01) managed by Lloyd=
 Will
  =20
b) West Power =01) there will be no changes to the Portland office which is=
=20
managed by Tim Belden and Chris Calger .  Both Tim and Chris will continue =
to=20
report to the EA OOC.
c) Canada and Mexico =01) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexic=
an=20
offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively. =
=20
Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.
d) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi=
ness=20
consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes=20
primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region=
=20
will consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and=20
origination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint=
=20
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=
se=20
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=
=20
the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=
te=20
origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=
=20
provide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team wil=
l=20
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20
Eastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be=20
responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=
=01,s, IPP=01,s=20
and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =
of=20
the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in=
=20
addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=
s=20
product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =
of=20
these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=
=20
origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank=
=20
Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20
West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=
ed by=20
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=
e=20
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=
=20
this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=
o=20
significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=
nd=20
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=
=20
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=
e=20
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =
and=20
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=
=20
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=
=20
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=
sk=20
and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=
=20
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20
opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=
=20
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20
Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=
 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=
d=20
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=
ed by=20
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=
. =20
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=
=20
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =
=20
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20
conduct business in that company.=20

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=
=20
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and=
=20
your family a very happy and safe holiday season.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our 
appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS 
with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest 
another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks.

She likes white wines like white burgundy--I don't know any of the exact 
ones, but I can find out if you want me to.

Another idea she would really like is a gift certificate to the Taste of 
Texas.  She went there recently for the first time and really enjoyed it.

We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our 
appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS 
with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest 
another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks.

Janie,

 I have been talking with EES and they have confirmed their volumes for their 
purchases from ENA (I believe that it is Zarin who comfirmed their volumes on 
their side).  I need you to confirm and verify our volumes and to change them 
(or contact who can change them) if needed.  I am trying to get EES to pay us 
for these transactions and they will not if they do not agree.  The amount 
that we are talking about is over $10 mil.  Could you please look at this so 
that I can get this resolved today?  The following shows what we are out:



Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks...

<< Us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date.
 Joe and I just got back from a vacation in Banff, Canada with Jackie and
 Dannie.  We had a wonderful time.  We did some major hiking there.  It was
 so relaxing.  We had no t.v. or phone for a week.  We're going to Montana
 over Labor Day week-end for Joe's niece's wedding.  Can't believe Joe and I
 are taking 2 vacatins this year.  Regarding logistically getting to your
 ranch, is it possible to fly into Colorado Springs or do we need to fly
 into Denver?  We would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date
 because I love to hike.

  >>
You could come into Colorado Springs,but it would add 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours
to your commute.  There used to be a price advantage, but I don't think there
is anymore, unless you've checked recently.  The cabin is about 2 hours
northwest of DIA.  It's great hiking!  Let's find a time!!!!  How are Jackie
and Dan??

Dear Optionee:

According to our records, you exercised Enron stock options on either 
December 27th or 28th.  When your stock options were initially exercised and 
processed, the income was treated as year 2001 income. 

We wanted to let you know that the income associated with your exercise will 
be reported as income in the year 2000.  Therefore, your 2000 Form W-2 will 
include these amounts as income.

Based on this, you will receive a revised confirmation of exercise from 
PaineWebber.  If you reached the maximum limit for Social Security taxes for 
the year 2000, then the Social Security taxes that were withheld on your 
December 27th or 28th exercise will be refunded to you on your January 12, 
2001 Enron paycheck.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Monique Blacklock at 
(713) 345-7885.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation.  
Randy continues to do an excellent job.  He anticipates questions and usually 
has the answers.  He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on 
his knowledge base.  He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha 
points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very 
valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.  The only area for 
improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his 
opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say 
anything or go along with the status quo.  He tends to want to be 
nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment 
and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.

Jane, I just faxed the January penalty support.  Also, you mentioned that we 
should be billing penalties on the trigger deal - 386140 (EPNG - Blanco 
Supply Area).  However, this deal is linked to the same contract as the 
penalty for the nomination error.  I have checked the contract again, and all 
of the exhibits are expired.  In addition, I cannot find an exhibit which 
covers EPNG-Blanco Supply Area.  Given this information, would you still like 
me to bill the penalty, and if so, at what rate?

Thanks for your help
Laurie

Faye has completed creating the AVG BLANCO meter on the EPNG/BLANCO zone.  
The physical location server has been bounced and  in order to see it in 
Sitara, you will have to close all open Sitara applications (including the 
Launch Pad) and get back in.  If you have any questions, please call me at 
x35423.

Bob, the new portfolios that your group will need to monitor to track these 
new BLANCO and AVG BLANCO transactions are listed below.  You can open these 
portfolios in Deal Manager or Deal Ticker.

Deal Confirm - EPNG/BLANCO
Deal Confirm - EPNG/AVGBLANCO

Just wanted to let everyone know about the changes that will be made in the 
upcoming week(s) to the EPNG/Blanco/Blanco meter.  Currently, Blanco is an 
active pool facility that is traded by the West desk.  In order to allow the 
Deal Confirmations group to identify which trades require special handling 
language in the confirm, we have all decided to create a second meter with 
the same data reference number in Global Facilities.  Doing this will serve 
three purposes.  First of all, creating a second meter on the same data 
reference number allows users to see two separate meters in Sitara without 
affecting the way that physical location is nominated to the pipe since all 
they receive is the data reference number.  The change will also allow the 
Product Controls Group to create multiple products in EOL with different 
pricing terms on the same physical point.  In addition, it will temporarily 
resolve the issue the Deal Confirmation is currently experiencing in 
segregating the confirmations that need special language.    I will be 
creating a portfolio that will include all new trades done at both BLANCO 
meters which will be monitored by the Deal Confirmation group.  I will make 
sure to contact all of you once the meter change has become effective.  When 
the change is completed, expect to see the following locations available for 
selection in Sitara.

Pipe Zone  Meter   Product Description
EPNG BLANCO BLANCO EP Blanco 100%; use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - 2 Nomination Cycle       language". 

EPNG BLANCO AVGBLANCO RESTRICTED, use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - Operational Constraints       language".

Please call me if you have any questions.

Per our conversation, here is the last draft out of that subcommittee.  As 
you remember, we were supposed to agree and then take our proposal back to 
the full group.  Unfortunately, that was about when the negotiations fell 
apart on the point allocations, so Rick Miles terminated the ADR process.

They tell me that having a high speed internet connection is essential for 
enron online (SDN-T).  That's the only latest info I have.

Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint 
against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.

The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts 
to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  
of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and 
the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a 
minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.

The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the 
Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that 
this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to 
as Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could 
be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is 
implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock 
border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  

SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock 
delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the 
capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They 
also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum 
of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if 
their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo 
until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being 
established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.

Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a 
reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.

After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:

Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not 
relate to receipt point rights.

1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);

2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)

3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or 
Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they
 give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up 
like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from 
Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.

4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:

   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock
Texaco   40    135
Burlington  26    74
Aero   5    15
Borax   7    12
LADWP  0    36
SWGas   0    20

5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:

Expansion Shippers  78000 
Socal Gas           425000
BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 
El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)
Total 851000
540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.

The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and 
felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off 
the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.

Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El 
Paso's counter -proposal.  

Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent 
thruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other 
forms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge 
Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as 
converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the 
producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, 
they would not pay anything.

Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their 
deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For 
volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric 
rate.

Bottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this 
case.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will 
study  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.

Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived 
gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more 
gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could 
be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  
El Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan 
based on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 
2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings 
andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a 
technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets 
resolved.

Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the 
keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the 
bondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, 
Southern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you 
advised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.

This is O.K as long as we get a daily estimate of usage around 8:30 C.T. and 
access to actuals within two business days.

What do you think about this strategy?  Maybe we should have Deb call Marion 
and review the list of hotels where Enron has a corporate rate and ask her 
opinion regarding which ones she would recommend.  Maybe -at that point she 
would volunteer her flat?

We will be releasing new EnronOnline functionality tonight which will be 
available for use on Monday morning. 

Two information sessions will be held in Houston to further explain the new 
functionality. It is very important to attend these sessions to fully 
understand the new features. For sessions in Calgary or Portland, please 
contact Savita Puthigai at 713 853 1787. For sessions in London, Oslo, 
Singapore, Australia or Tokyo, please contact PCG London on +44 20 7783 7783.


Date     Time   Location
Tuesday, 27th February  3.30 to 4.00  EB 27C2
Wednesday, 28th February 3.30 to 4.00  EB 27C2


There are two areas of new functionality: Spreads and Stack Manager.

Spreads

>From Monday, Enron traders will be able to define a Spread product on 
EnronOnline in which the customer can trade on a single spread product and 
receive a transaction for each leg of the underlying products.

For example, a customer could select to buy the April vs May Spread Product. 
A successful transaction would result in a Sell for the April Product and a 
Purchase for the May Product. Both of these underlying transactions will show 
up in the customer's transaction list (the spread itself will not show up - 
only the two legs). The price for Leg 1 will be equal to the average of the 
bid and offer, or the bid or offer alone if the averge cannot be computed 
because either side is  missing , for the Leg 1 Product. The price for Leg 2 
will be equal to the price for Leg1, plus the spread price.

To ensure accuracy and consistency, EnronOnline Product Control will set up 
these new Products initially.

Stack Manager

There are a few changes to Stack Manager which may or may not be directly 
associated with Spreads:

New Stack Link Type

On the Link Dropdown box on the Product Properties page, there is a new Stack 
Link Type called "Stack Basis Link". If you select this link, then the price 
you enter into the stack depth window will be added to the price in the stack 
depth window from the parent (it will not be added to the calculated price of 
the parent which appears on the website). For example:
 Product 1 is a Stand Alone Product, with Bid at $5.00
 Product 2 is a Basis Link Child, with Stack Depth Price at $0.25, so the 
calculated total price which appears on the website is $5.25
 Product 3 is a Stack Basis Link, with Stack Depth Price at $0.05, so the 
calculated total price which appears on the website is $0.30


Autohedge Changes

If an Enron trader has an autohedge set up between two products which they 
are managing under the same book, then the Parent product will respond as 
though an autohedge transaction has occurred, but no transaction will 
actually be entered into the system. This is intended to simplify position 
management where you want the parent price to respond to a transaction on the 
child, but do not want to manually remove transactions within the same book.

Note that autohedge functionality remains the same as it was before this 
update for autohedge transactions between products which are not in the same 
book.

Trade Linked View

You can now view linked transactions together on the transaction display 
section in the stack manager. To do so, right click in the transaction 
display section and select linked view. You will see a single transaction 
with a plus sign for any linked deals (e.g. spreads and autohedged deals). To 
see the individual transactions that make up the linked transaction click on 
the plus sign. 

You can display the linked transactions in a expanded or collapsed view. To 
do so right click in the transaction display area and select    Full Expand 
or Full Collapse.

To return to the default transaction display, right click in the transaction 
display area and select Transaction view.


New EnronOnline Contact

As part of a restructuring within EnronOnline, Savita Puthigai will be your 
primary contact within EnronOnline for Trading and System Design issues. 
Future emails such as this one will be sent from her address. She can be 
contacted in Houston on 31787.

Deb and I were thinking that if we can't finalize our Europe trip by the end 
of this week-we probably need to postpone it because the clock is ticking. .  
Can you give us any feedback on your discussions with  American Express or 
Mark Frevert..  Thinking about you.

Subject: RE: EPNG Settlement Proposal


As promised during today's meeting, attached is a file containing some data
on the quantity of gas physically flowing out of each of the receipt basins
for the period 1998 through June 8, 2000.  The data was taken from the VISA
system (note the index numbers on the spreadsheet) and is presented
graphically and as tabular values.

The flow west on the southern system is shown as the sum of west flow
through Pecos River and Waha stations less the east flow from Cornudas.
This represents the net volume flowing west from Cornudas Station into the
combined low and high pressure southern systems.  It eliminates the volumes
moved east to Waha for delivery into the Texas intrastate pipelines at Waha.

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you.

Jane, any chance you or Randy or Tori could go to this meeting?  Norm has 
called it for this Friday, presumably to discuss some of the points you 
raised in your discussion with him (according to the voice mail he left me).  
It will be in El Paso, starting at 1:00 pm MT.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can make it, and I've left Norm a voice mail 
message to that effect.  However, I'm not too optimistic about it getting 
rescheduled for next week.  I'm losing 2-1/2 days going to Las Vegas for the 
settlement conference as it is, and I will have to get my Order 637 comments 
finalized by Friday afternoon in order to get them filed next Monday.  We 
have some big problems with segmentation proposals (or lack thereof) for 
Columbia and CNG, as well as some issues on several of the other pipelines 
that filed.

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

If it is not too late I would like to put on hold my request to add Barrett 
Resources to the EOL Product for El Paso Blanco Average. I made the request 
yesterday so hopefully I am not toolate. Upon discussing the product with 
Barrett, I do not think this would be a good idea to add them at the present 
time.  I willkeep you advised.  Thank you for your patience.

Kim:

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for 
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of things 
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have 
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas 
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily 
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and 
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this 
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase 
the demand charge for orig. 

Call me first thing on Monday

Hello Cathy and Ed-

Just wanted to let you know my progress on cost estimates and documents.

The paperwork will be broken down into two documents for the initial phase.  
The first is a "Commitment" letter (an LOI of sorts) for just the free 
posting system we have been talking about.  It will be followed by a full 
blown "Electronic Transacations Agreement" that I am sure will take much 
longer for all our lawyers to get through.  I need to get the LOI's done to 
show our management here the level of commitment we have from our initial 
launch pipelines, and it should be to you within the week.  I am hoping this 
short document will not have a tough time getting through your legal 
processes.  The next document (ETA) will closely follow the LOI's, but I know 
will be more of a negotiation since that is where the real details are 
spelled out.

We are still in the process of finalizing the costs (Gap Analysis) and the 
deliverables for the GIR settlement system requirements.  I should have more 
information on this by the end of the week.

We unfortunately have had some slippage on the start date of phase one due to 
some scope changes, and personnel issues.  We are definately looking into 
first quarter of next year, so that buys us some time with getting the 
documents through our respective legal departments.  I apologize for this 
delay, but once we have the signed LOI's back in our shop, we will be able to 
lock down a launch date.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

I will update you as news breaks......

Thanks,

Julie  :-)

Do we need to carify the max daily quantity on which the demand charge is 
assessed  reflects usage and not nominations.  Just don't want to be in a 
position where we must do make-up and have to nom more than 20000.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

I'm comng to town on Sat urday night  Feb 3 (Sat) and  leaving Feb 5th 
(mon).  I have to leave San Diego on Monday afternoon to meet with Socal that 
night.  I have to come in on the week-end because air-fares are horrible 
without  a Saturday night stay and I'd rather stay the week-end in San 
Diego.  If you have any time on Sunday or can meet me on Monday  for 
breakfast or lunch let me know.  I haven't finalized anything with Larry yet 
but I plan on meeting him for breakfast or lunch on Monday but I want to 
check with you  first.

Forgot to tell you that Joe and I went to see the Jim Rome show when he was 
in Houston a couple of weeks ago .  It was pretty good.  Too bad you'll never 
see him in Omaha.  Guess what else?  We got a memo today that Enron is giving 
all of its employees a home  computer and will subsidize their internet 
connection.  Gift is part of their commitment to techonology.  Does your 
company do this with your telephones?

SRRS Decommissioning Notification

We are one @Enron

Effective Friday December 22, 2000, you will have a new Security Request=20
Database:

In the past, Enron Corporate/North American users have used the Security=20
Resource Request System (SRRS) lotus notes database for their security=20
request needs including New Hire/Contractor/Temporary access and=20
Terminations. In response to the business reorganization, the IT Security a=
nd=20
Controls group is working to streamline Enron=01,s Security Request structu=
re=20
and create one single request database for all groups to use, eRequest,=20
located at http://itcentral.enron.com/

Please click on the following link to retrieve the eRequest training guide:=
 =20

http://itcentral.enron.com/data/services/training/documentationurl/

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate security requests in Enron's Global Enterprise.  When you attempt=
=20
to access the SRRS through Lotus Notes on Dec. 22, you will find a link to=
=20
the new eRequest system. =20

If you have additional questions regarding your new security request or if=
=20
you have any problems with the eRequest system, please contact Information=

Thank you

Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product 
name:  EPNG SoCal Ehr.  This product name should be used under the product 
type US Gas Phy.  The description should contain the same language as the 
EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted 
every time the word "Topock" appears.
 
We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, 
but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index 
product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would 
also have to change the description of the original index product as well.
 
I left you a message to call me if you can today.  Thanks.

Cindy needed the money to pay for her new fully furnished house in the 
Woodlands.  not to mention the 55 acres she just bought across the road from 
her house in Aspen.  I only need enough to pay off my measley mortgage,  I 
have cashed in on most of my options though.

It's not looking good to come visit you this summer.  Deb is moving into her 
new house sometime during th end of July and then she promised to take her 
nieces and nephews on vacation sometime this summer.  I think we are going to 
try for next spring or summer to come visit you if the offer is still open..  
Sorry- I'm sure you are disappointed.  However, if something changes, we will 
let you know.
