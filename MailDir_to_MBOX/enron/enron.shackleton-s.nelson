Hi Sara, since I will be out of the office for a chunk of the day to attend 
the funeral, I wanted you to know what is going on with this.  I had 
completed the legal review of these documents but we needed some technical 
information from Julie.  (See attached).  Julie had provided all of the 
information except one task.  I have asked her and Stephanie to coordiate 
getting this information and to get it to Selena's assistant for execution.

Julie, the agreements are ready for Gary Hickerson's signatures.  Can you 
pick them up from Stephanie Panus, Senior Legal Specialist (I have left them 
on Stephanie's chair), and walk them down to Gary for signature  -- please 
turn them over to Selena's assistant.  Selena is at EB3072. Selena is out of 
the office today but her assistant will help get the documents executed, as 
per Selena's instructions before she left.  We have to get this done today.  
Gary has to initial at every tab I have marked.

But before you walk them down, there is one piece of info I need you to fill 
out and one that I need Stephanie to do; this is probably why it is a good 
idea that you guys hook up.

Julie, as per my email, I need the answer to question 2 on page 17: List the 
URL address locations of the NASDAQ Subscriber Agreement for any sites that 
you support.

Stephanie, can you insert the tax i.d. number for ECT Investments- this 
information had to be placed on the NYSE agreement.

I will be back in the office tomorrow morning between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., 
then I am leaving to attend a funeral.  I do not know what time I will return 
but I will call in to make sure that these agreements get executed.

Hi Sara, 

(1) For clarification, my voicemail was not full on Friday - I checked it, 
got several messages including one fromTom Doukas and called him and others 
immediately as I arrived.  My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked 
in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the 
calls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due 
to the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am 
working on so I do try to clear the box daily.

(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan 
you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that 
you get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on 
vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That 
way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although 
I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much 
about where I keep particular files or documents.  

(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt 
uncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have 
chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  
(The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment 
across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My 
getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my 
presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  

Equally important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as 
she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only 
answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I 
think they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions 
with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or 
sick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that 
our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide 
in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not 
required.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for 
some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to 
rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the 
information you are getting is accurate.

Why did he call "angry" in the first instance? I thought that there was no rush on Con Ed -- or at least not a rush as in other deals I am working on where (1) the counterparty's attorney is leaving her company or (2) the counterparty's attorney is going on jury duty or (3) the counterparty is already in default?

Mark:
I and several other people in our group are concerned about Cheryl's apparent 
unwillingness to attend on a consistent basis group meetings (i.e., 
legal/credit meetings and seminars and our legal group meeting) that are 
held.  I understand from Sara that today Tana had to go and get Cheryl to 
come to the legal/credit meeting.  Last week, she did not show up for the 
legal/credit seminar that Brent held.  Could you please talk to her about 
this?  I am concerned that she is not plugged into our group and is not 
learning and hearing the things that she needs to be learning and hearing.  I 
alos think that it is important to act and be like a team on some matters and 
not an individual.  Thanks.

Hi Tom,  at your request the execution of these agreements have been on 
hold.  Most of the leg work has been done.  I completed the negotiations on 
the agreement so moving forward is a matter of getting a document ready for 
signatures and getting it signed, having lawyers on both side proof read it 
and getting the agreement and accompanying documents (which are complete) 
executed.  This process, which is mainly administrative, could take two or 
three days if I focused on as a priority to make sure it gets done.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Sara & Cheryl,

Could you please provide a status on where we stand on the transfer of the 
Credit book from ENA/ECT to ECI at Goldman and Morgan.

I had previously asked you to hold up on Morgan until the Bear issue was 
resolved.  I am hoping we do not have to much effort ahead of us to move 
these two accounts over.

Thanks,

Tom

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about 
some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not 
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know 
it executed).  But for my own understanding:

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the 
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need 
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a 
Securities Loan Agreement?

		 Subject: Brokerage Agreement Files & Management/Legal Assistant Tasks

Hello Team, 

Now that we have sent for execution or executed close to 50 new agreements 
and we have to refer back to these agreements and documents, it is all the 
more important that we make sure that the administrative tasks we previously  
discussed are in fact accomplished.    I suggest that we schedule a meeting 
to make sure 

(1) that, as per our previous discussions, Stephanie or whichever legal 
assistant working on brokerage agreements are tracking the agreements sent 
out and creating the brokerage agreement files once the Agreements are 
executed.   Also, we want to make sure everyone knows where to go when you 
need certain documents/where these files are located and what is supposed to 
be in them.  (I think they were just moved from Samantha's desk to 
Stephanie's desk, right?)

(2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal 
assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes 
when she receives the documents.

(3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader 
announcements and changes.  I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also 
needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give 
notice when the list of authorized traders changes - this is critical, 
especially now that there are so many accounts and so many changes.  Maybe we 
can draft a form letter and have a template or something.  We should also 
create a list of contact persons to whom such a list has to go to.

(4) Also, now that we have more another legal assistant, we should meet to 
discuss how the assistant can "take back" some of the tasks I had taken on to 
make life easier without such help - getting signatures, preapring the 
documents, calling the counterparty etc.  This will free-up some much needed 
time to review ISDA's, Confirms etc.

(5) Which legal assistants will work on what?

Sara may have additional topics, this is just some of immediate concern.

Sara, 

You had asked me to retrieve from Bear Stearns a copy of our initial/unused guaranty that you (or Stephanie?) sent to them.  As you know from the emails that I forwarded to you, I had contacted their counsel several times asking that she return the guaranty.  Anna finally called me back today to say outright that they lost both the executed version and any copies.  Anna suggested that as a remedy we could draft some document memorializing its status.   Let me know if you want me  to forward the voicemail or if there is anything I can do to help.

Hi Theresa, 

I promised you an update today on the Goldman Sachs International Terms of 
Business Letter.  I am in contact with Sarah at Goldman Sachs daily and am 
trying to get her to set aside a time to discuss any outstanding issues and a 
time table for quickly getting the account executed.  I anticipate that she 
and I will speak to try to wrap things up tomorrow or Wednesday.  I willl 
keep you posted.  Until then, you can know that I call or email over there 
every day or every other day.

Between last night and this morning, I talked to Brian Coad and figured out 
what was going on.  The file confirms that someone in Risk Management put 
this deal on hold in November.  I talked to Jason by phone last night and he 
confirmed that this is what happened.  I had placed calls to Frost since 
working on the project but the lawyer did not rush to call since he has been 
out of the office until their business folks started pressing them this 
week.  So, I completed a legal review & figured out what the remaining issues 
are that need to be resolved with counsel.  (One of which was a convulated 
SEC issue that we figured out last night). I sent Brian a final draft and he 
is implementing those changes in a draft for his counsel.  His counsel is out 
of the office until Monday but Brian put us in contact.  I would predict that 
we will settle on the final terms on Monday, make minor changes to the final 
draft and get it executed by then.

With respect to Morgan, I believe that a paragraph could be added to reflect 
the parties' agreement to a forum other than a contract market (i.e., "AAA"), 
and if the customer chose a particular forum for arbitration, then the 
parties could stipulate that the arbitrators not have authority to award 
punitive, exemplary or similar damages.   Because these are fairly old forms, 
I can't recall the reason for excluding this language.

I'll schedule some time on Monday for us to talk.

Hi Sara,

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

Hey Sara,  

Let's talk in detail Monday but just quickly -  its precisely the decision to 
include the arbitration clause that makes the language prohibitive.  I think 
the gist of the applicable NASD rule is that members cannot draft arbitration 
clauses which limit the damages that either party would otherwise be entitled 
to in  court.  Thus, the solution if Morgan or the others object would be to 
draft a clause that is consistent with what New York provides -- since New 
York is the applicable jurisdiction.  (I'll find a sample clause I drafted in 
the past and bring when we meet).  Otherwise, these firms could be fined for 
including such language.  I am going to find the applicable rule and make 
sure that it is still good law but off hand I believe that it is.  It will be 
interesting to note if any of the firms object on this ground.  

I may have some questions about other legal issues in the agreements; if so, 
I will bring them up when we meet so that we can work through them together.

Sara, I do not agree with the view that we cannot use the existing 
resolutions for repos.  Please call me at your convenience so that we can

I am assuming that you are saying that if repos go through the Prime Broker 
accounts it is a problem.  The poblem being that the current brokerage 
agreements for ECI do not provide for repos.  Is my assumption correct?

Is our UCD adequate as is for repos?

What is our existing format that you mention below?

Are you able to pursue this with Goldman right now today?

Thanks,

Tom

Tom:

I am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse 
repurchase transactions and securities lending, bonds borrow pledge, etc. as 
the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of 
transactions.  However, if the repo party will accept our existing format, 
then we need not worry.  I'll call Ted Leh and try to find the proper Goldman 
person.

Sara,

Can you please provide your findings on the following items:

1. Determine with Cheryl that ECI is in fact authorized to transact Repos

2. How robust the Goldman Repo agreements are, and their sutability to ECI.

3. An estimate on how long it will take to set up the Goldman Repo Agreements 
in ECI's name.


Can you please also provide any ideas how ECI or ECL could transact a Repo 
trade today using existing documentation.


London has indicated an urgent need to carry out these transactions.

Thanks,

Tom

Hi Stephanie, I will get the final version of ECT - Goldman International 
agreement by the end of the day  onThursday and there is a lot of pressure to 
get it executed right away.   Tomorrow can you prepare and execute the 
accompanying documents.  For ECT's Authorized Traders List, you need to add 
Mark Schlueter (doublecheck spelling and phone number) to the list of 
traders.  This is a HIGH priority.

Please also revise the the trader list for both the ENA (add Peter Schluter) 
and ECT  (add Mark) in order to execute the Deutsche Bank agreements we 
discussed today.   We also got calls today about getting this one executed  
since we already have signatures from Deutsche Bank.

Thanx.

Hi Mary,

It is my understanding that Cassandra is out on vacation until Monday.

Thank you for passing the Morgan Stanley brokerage account agreement and 
Officers and Authorized Trader List on to Cassandra to sign.  As per the Deal 
Sheet attached, we need to open the account immediately so that Enron 
Investment Partners, Inc. can meet the Securities and Exchange Commission 
requirements and sell-dribble the stock on the planned date.  

Enron Investment Partners has requested that we have the documents executed 
before they meet with Cynet late Monday morning.

If possible, please help me insure that Cassandra signs the documents first 
thing Monday morning.  I will call to follow up.  Thank you again for all of 
your help.

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Tana,  Stephanie and I just confirmed that I still do not have full access to 
lotus notes.  I cannot, for example, edit any legal notes re: our 
brokerage/trading agreements.  Stephanie suggested that I ask you for 
guidance.


Stephanie, as per our discussion, in the meantime can you put the following 
updates in Lotus notes:

ITG POSIT:   Cheryl sent document for execution on 2/8.  Sheila Glover 
suggested changes to pricing schedule.  2/9 Cheryl called counsel regarding 
need to edit.

WSI:  2/9 Cheryl talked to John Bosse and recommended some material changes.  
Bosse is sending a forecast agreeemtn today so that some terms therein can be 
implemented into a final draft.  Will call on Monday to follow up.

Bear Sterns InterConnect:  2/9 Cheryl sent an email message to Christine 
Durlin and she responded.  We are in the process of discussing problematic 
issues re: arbitration and indemnification.  Bear Sterns apologized for the 
delay -- they admitted to losing the paperwork and changing personnel who 
were handling the agreement.  Cheryl and Christine plan to look into the 
issues and talk Monday or Tuesday.

Robertson Stephens:   2/9 Cheryl called Alberto Delgadillo again asking for 
the status on their legal review.  
2/5: Samantha called -- they said they never got the comments that our 
outside counsel sent on 1/5 so Samantha resent. 

JP Morgan: 2/9 & 2/1 Cheryl left message for status of their review of our 
comments.

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Hi Stephanie, I will get the final version of ECT - Goldman International 
agreement by the end of the day  onThursday and there is a lot of pressure to 
get it executed right away.   Tomorrow can you prepare and execute the 
accompanying documents.  For ECT's Authorized Traders List, you need to add 
Mark Schlueter (doublecheck spelling and phone number) to the list of 
traders.  This is a HIGH priority.

Please also revise the the trader list for both the ENA (add Peter Schluter) 
and ECT  (add Mark) in order to execute the Deutsche Bank agreements we 
discussed today.   We also got calls today about getting this one executed  
since we already have signatures from Deutsche Bank.

Thanx.

Hi Sara and Stephanie,

 It is my understanding that the paralegals working on the brokerage accounts 
are to (1) send documents to counterparties; (2) track their return and (3) 
keep the fully executed documents received from counterparties in the file 
cabinet next to Stephanie's office.

 In light of our being short-staffed in light of Samantha's absence, I have 
tried to be helpful to our team by assisting in preparing the documents for 
execution & getting some signatures.  I hope that has been helpful.  But once 
Stephanie [or whichever legal assistant assumes her role] notes that the 
documents have gone out, then that person should track the documents and be 
the keeper of records.

I completed research confirming that certain provisions in arbitration 
clauses of brokerage agreements are unenforceable under NASD rules (which 
have the force of federal law) and U.S. Supreme Court precedent.    These 
provisions have to do with limitation of damages, choice of situs of 
arbitration and other relevant issues.  Our complete understanding of the 
issues is extremely helpful in negotiating brokerage agreements.  It also 
raises the issue of whether or not we want to amend our legal policy.

Please advise whether you want to meet to discuss or would like a brief memo.

Stephanie, you may want to clarify all of the facts as well.  That a local phone number was disconnected is irrelevant because keegan called my cell phone number and spoke with my fiance.  He and Keegan then called my house in New York and notified my family that Keegan wanted to reach me.  They conveyed that message to me immediately as I walked though the door.  I then immediately called Keegan the minute I walked into my house in New York.  

As I mentioned to Sara, if you need to reach me

You may want to clarify this with Keegan as 1) your voice mail was full on that Friday, 2) Keegan tried to contact you in New York and the number she had for you was disconnected, and 3) we tried to locate the documents that Friday and were not able to.

we should have it executed this week.  Sara, let's discuss first -- I wanted 
to show you the limitation of liability clause as per our discussion; it will 
need Mark H.'s approval.

Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you 
tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage 
meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring 
ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is 
always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.

Keegan is going to forward to you some documents sent by ISI.  The document=
s ae part of a prime broker agreement that ENA has to have in place with Be=
ar so that ISI can clear the trades.  The attached agreement is a boiler pl=
ate vanilla agreement.  Please check the files and Lotus Notes to determine=
 whether ENA has an executed agreement for the account number noted on the =
documents.  Also, please clarify the matter one way or the other with ISI a=
nd Bear by calling, among others, the names listed on the top of the agreem=
etn.  These are the folks at Bear that ISI is dealing with, and who say tha=
t they have no record of an agreement.  I would think we already have an ag=
reement and if not, we do not want to sue the boilerplate -- we would at le=
ast use an edited version of the agreement I have on file which we have suc=
cessfully negotiated with other parties.  If you have any questions please =
let me know.  Please also update lotus notes to reflect what you find.  (A =
while back, Bear goofed when John Galloti got confused and sent us a copy o=
f an executing agreement or boilerplate -- please note that we want to send=
 to ISI a copy of a prime broker agreement between ENA and Bear). =20

Also, Keegan or I will forward to you today or tomorrow the agreement that =
I have just negotiated with CFSB.  Please add a lotus notes entry for this =
clearing agreemetn.  Note that we sent commetns on 5/11 and had to resend t=
hem.  We had a conference call today in which we settled on the final versi=
on of the agreement.  Thanx.

Sara,  Keegan and I do not know what you are saying you want to do finally.  

You indicated yesterday that you did not have any meetings scheduled with me 
today on brokerage accounts and immediately thereafter, Keegan and I adjusted 
my schedule accordingly with other meetings.  

Are you now saying that you want to still meet at these times referenced in 
Kay's email below.   

Or, are you saying, based on a more recent email, that you only want to meet 
Monthly?

Let us know.

Hey Sara, got your voice message.  Everything is under control.  Specifically:

1. I completed my review of the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage agreements early 
last week so I do not need you to take over the review.  You just need to 
tell me how you wanted to proceed to make sure we are all on the same page.

2.  The Sanford Bernstein and Smith Barney Electronic Trading Agreements are 
among the batch of agreements you gave me on Monday so those will be under 
review by me this week.  I plan to send comments out to them as soon as 
possible.  I am already aware that these are a priority because I keep Aneela 
and/or Theresa updated by phone every day.

 I am feeling alot better, thanx.

Enjoy your day away from the office.

me the name of the IT attorney you mentioned on this floor or any other IT 
attorney who might have such a model?  Or Mark do you have any such referral 
from Net Works or any one else at Enron?  (I know of Mark Hollsworth upstairs

Hi Sara, attached, as per your request, is a copy of the most updated list.  

Reminder that if you do not receive a copy, you can always go into the legal 
directory and get it.  Look in o:\legal\CNelson\brokerage agreements -status 
reports.  Then, note that the name of each document reflects the date it was 
created.  So, the doc below was done last week on May 23rd.

Sara, as I stated below, I checked my lotus notes entry and did not see it.  
This could be because lotus notes is in disarray or just in the stress we are 
all face being under the gun, I am overlooking it.  But we all agreed 
yesterday that time is of the essence and this matter is now of the most 
critical importance so if you see the information or otherwise have it, 
particularly because you have spoken with her, the please, forward the 
information so that we can get the guaranty executed.  Thank you.

Cheryl:

1.  Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information.

2.  No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were 
essential.  I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.  I 
suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis.  Often, the broker 
will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs.  
This must be determined on an ad hoc basis.

Sara:

1. Ms. Lewis' information does not appear to be in the lotus notes entry for 
ECI-Bear that I have used for the past two weeks.  Re: lotus notes, however, 
I certainly could be wrong. If you are certain, please point out or forward.

2.  You indicated in our meeting in my office that someone represented that 
Bear does not need the standard accompanying documents to open the account.  
As per my email request yesterday evening, can you confirm who determined 
this (if it was not you) so that I know what is going on and what I can 
represent in talking with the people at Bear?

Sara, I have stopped by your office but you are not around.  Please provide 
the following information/clarification in light of your conversations with 
other folks:

1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents 
with the agreements to get things moving?

2.  If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get 
this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has 
advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like 
Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project.

3. Re: this attorney Cheryl at Bear  that you have talked to -- what is her 
full name, phone, and fax?


Thanx.

Hello Team, 

Sara is going to work on this agreement.

We noticed that the specified Enron entity was "ECT Optimization."  That

Hello Team, 

Sara is going to work on this agreement.

We noticed that the specified Enron entity was "ECT Optimization."  That entity is not familiar to us.  Is that right or did we mean ECT Investments Inc.?  Please let Sara know.

Thanx again, Sara.

Sheila, as per our conversation on Friday, I was out sick from the 15th 
through the 22nd therefore I was not able to turn back to my review of this 
Agreement until today.  

I completed the review this morning and have sent the comments to my 
assistant to type.  Therefore, we should have comments to forward by the end 
of the day today.

Stephanie, you may want to clarify all of the facts as well.  That a local 
phone number was disconnected is irrelevant because keegan called my cell 
phone number and spoke with my fiance.  He and Keegan then called my house in 
New York and notified my family that Keegan wanted to reach me.  They 
conveyed that message to me immediately as I walked though the door.  I then 
immediately called Keegan the minute I walked into my house in New York.  

As I mentioned to Sara, if you need to reach me

You may want to clarify this with Keegan as 1) your voice mail was full on 
that Friday, 2) Keegan tried to contact you in New York and the number she 
had for you was disconnected, and 3) we tried to locate the documents that 
Friday and were not able to.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you 
the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into 
my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave 
it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able 
to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask 
Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she 
always knows how to reach me.

Sara: 

I will forward the documents to you.  

For future reference, if anyone is looking for a file for an urgent matter 
while I am out, she should convey that fact to me by either (1) leaving a 
voice mail - as I checked my voicemails on Friday (that is how I was able to 
speak with Tom from New York on Friday) or (2) advise Keegan and she will 
contact me immediately by cell phone as she did regarding other matters on 
Friday.

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution 
as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as 
the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a 
message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. 
("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the 
following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the 
amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday 
of last week.

Thanks Cheryl.

I need only ensure the funds we will need in order to meet the margin call at 
Morgan is ready.



David,

I expect the needed margin at Morgan to be under $30mm once we move our longs 
out.  Morgan has today agreed to 25% for shorts (from an average of 50%).  Of 
the $30mm needed half is already at Goldman and Bear.  

I anticipate therefore no more than $15mm in needed funds.  It may in fact be 
less I will true up tomorrow

Can we get this by next week, and allow Cheryl to proceed full steam?



Thanks,

Tom

Hi Tom,  at your request the execution of these agreements have been on 
hold.  Most of the leg work has been done.  I completed the negotiations on 
the agreement so moving forward is a matter of getting a document ready for 
signatures and getting it signed, having lawyers on both side proof read it 
and getting the agreement and accompanying documents (which are complete) 
executed.  This process, which is mainly administrative, could take two or 
three days if I focused on as a priority to make sure it gets done.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Sara & Cheryl,

Could you please provide a status on where we stand on the transfer of the 
Credit book from ENA/ECT to ECI at Goldman and Morgan.

I had previously asked you to hold up on Morgan until the Bear issue was 
resolved.  I am hoping we do not have to much effort ahead of us to move 
these two accounts over.

Thanks,

Tom

Sam, I am forwarding to you the final version of the ECT Investments - 
Raymond James Agreement today for execution.  By the end of the day, R/J 
should call me back with a separate account number for an identical agreement 
for ENA for signature as well.  Please have the accompanying docs ready so 
that we can send everything out for signature asap.

Stephanie, by the end of the day or Monday, we are going to have ready for 
execution the agreements with "Simmons" and Frost -- both with ENA.  Can you 
doublecheck with Aneela that this choice, based on her list, is correct.  
Then, when these come in at the end of the day or Monday I will forward for 
execution.

Do we know who other than Gary could sign any agreements today?  If not, 
maybe we will take all of these, plus Robertson Stephens and J.P. Morgan to 
him on Monday.

We may have to wait until Monday to talk about Enron Credit because I have to 
spend the rest of the afternoon preparing the SEC docs, opinion letters and 
other documents for the sale of the Cynet stock by the Houston Economic 
Opportunity Fund LP.

I think I have this under control -- it is basically the same long drill I 
did for Trutta.  When everything is done, I'll doublecheck with one of them 
to make sure nothing is undone.  Thanx.

Cheryl:

Should you have any SEC issues (whether these are reps or forms to be 
completed, you should check with Travis or Lance (or anyone suggested by 
them).  As you may know, ENA has an affiliated registered broker-dealer (and 
that fact could be pertinent in some type of rep).  Thanks.

Sam, I am forwarding to you the final version of the ECT Investments - 
Raymond James Agreement today for execution.  By the end of the day, R/J 
should call me back with a separate account number for an identical agreement 
for ENA for signature as well.  Please have the accompanying docs ready so 
that we can send everything out for signature asap.

Stephanie, by the end of the day or Monday, we are going to have ready for 
execution the agreements with "Simmons" and Frost -- both with ENA.  Can you 
doublecheck with Aneela that this choice, based on her list, is correct.  
Then, when these come in at the end of the day or Monday I will forward for 
execution.

Do we know who other than Gary could sign any agreements today?  If not, 
maybe we will take all of these, plus Robertson Stephens and J.P. Morgan to 
him on Monday.

We may have to wait until Monday to talk about Enron Credit because I have to 
spend the rest of the afternoon preparing the SEC docs, opinion letters and 
other documents for the sale of the Cynet stock by the Houston Economic 
Opportunity Fund LP.

My thoughts:  I suggest that each Nelson file be assigned by the paralegals to an attorney mentor as well as Cheryl and that we ask that Cheryl not send any matters out until reviewed by the particular mentor attorney.  In this way we can assure that items are not being externally distributed without review.  I am trying to get with her on all Canada files and have asked that she always check in with me prior to distribution.  However, I think other ISDA world matters are being distributed without adequate review.

Hi Sara, I wanted to let you know that I made calls re: these files we previosly discussed:

Cross Timbers & Ocean Energy- Jay will call me next week when Fred gets back from out of town.

Quebicor - left messages for Ken.

Russell Metals - Carol will get back to me.

Camden -- figuring it out with Aparna.

* I did not call any one on Clorox because I noted that I should call a "Gerald Sypro" and could not find such a person in people finder -- but will figure this out.  

Montana Power -- I will call Tanya today or Tuesday.

While situations arise where I might need some information on the status of 
the various agreements, I generally would prefer to relie on the collective 
competence of the experts (ie, yourselves) to get them resolved.  Therefore, 
please remove me from these distributions unless outstanding situations arise.

Thanks and regards,

		 Subject: Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. executing broker agreement

Cassandra and Cheryl,
 ENA has begun an executing broker relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald.  The 
business purpose for establishing the relationship is because Cantor is a 
market maker in illiquid convertible bonds.  This relationship is for 
execution only.  All settlements will still occur through existing Prime 
Brokers Goldman, Morgan and Bear.  The agreement is to be established for ENA 
only.

Thanks,
Theresa

Good Morning All!

I have made a mistake; I thought I sent a notice last week that Cheryl was planning to be out this Monday.  FYI, she will be out for the entire day and will return to the office at her regular time, tomorrow.  I apologize for any inconvenience my oversight may have caused.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sara, 

Keegan has notified me this morning (!) that my calendar contains a sheduling 
conflict (again) between the swaps group meeting which is 10-11 and a meeting 
with representatives coming from GE.  I think Keegan got confused or 
something.  Since this has happened before, I am going to sit down with 
Keegan this afternoon to discuss how to schedule and to troubleshoot 
scheduling issues.  


For today, I am going to try to do this - I am going to try to end the GE 
meeting early but I cannot promise.  As I explained to Keegan, since the GE 
meeting is with someone traveling to Enron to attend and is critical to Enron 
Corp., I will not be able to cancel it at the last minute.

If I do not attend, please apologize to the Group to me.  I am a bit 
frustrated because I certainly wanted to attnd to find out what everyone else 
is working on and to report on what I am doing.  I will try to email an 
update in advance and if you do not mind, maybe you could share it with the 
Group.

		 Subject: Scheduling & Conflicts

Hi Keegan, 

Thank you for calling this morning to provide me with my schedule for today.  

I want to share some constructive advice on how to fine tune our strategy 
with respect to scheduling because Keegan this is critical to my providing 
the best legal counsel I can to the various clients we serve.  You indicated 
that there is a conflict on the schedule in that there is a 9:30-10:30 
meeting that conflicts with the Swaps Group meeting.  We do not want to 
schedule conflicting meetings and then realize it at the last minute and then 
just notify one group that we can't attend.  

What you want to do is this:  You want to try at the time of the invitation 
to attend or as soon as practicable to notify me that there would be a 
potential conflict.  Then I will try to rescheduel.  This is especially 
important because the meetings with GSS are usually with folks from outside 
Enron, so once we agree to attend, it is nearly impossible the morning before 
to try to reschedule.  But the swaps meetings and credit meetings are very 
important and there are a lot of issues I need to discuss and anticipated 
attending.  Also and I have missed some in the past due to scheduling 
conflicts.  

Again, I also hope and need for you to take this advice constructively and 
not personally.  I appreciate all of your efforts, Keegan.  

Let's meet this afternoon to talk strategy.  Please note on my calendar that 
Ischeduled two meetings this morning, one at 2:30 and one immediately 
following at 3:30 until 5.  So we should meet before then.

Sara, I just the message you just left about playing phone tag with Anna at 
Bear Stearns.  As the lotus notes and the attached correspondence indicates, 
I was proactive today in contacting Anna to follow through since she did not 
return my last call a few days ago.  Since we already have a meeting set up 
for tomorrow at 10, I guess her message to you must be old (unless she is not 
the person responding to her email).  I also spoke this week with the 
attorneys representing the other brokerage firms and resent comments to them 
after they confessed that they had misplaced the previous ones.  Thus, from 
my perspective, we have been diligent in trying to open the accounts.

I too would like for us to discuss the other tasks that have to be done.  
However, I cannot meet today to do so at all.  I am troubleshooting several 
ABSOLUTELY URGENT tasks that have to get done today for ITG and for the CYNET 
deal.  I am available to meet tomorrow at my earliest convenience.

 As you may or may not know, we had two other "EMERGENCIES" with respect to 
brokerage accounts having to do with Frost, Cynet and another -- I cannot 
even remember which.  And, aside from these, we just executed four agreements 
in the past week.   

I want to reassure you that I believe to the best of everyone's ability we 
are as diligent as possible in getting these things done.   I will contact 
Keegan to set up a meeting as soon as possible tomorrow to talk about Enron 
Credit Inc.

Hi Aneela, 

I have agreed to have my assistant work with me to send updates for the Legal 
Agreement Status memo to you.  I have gotten several of the Agreements on the 
list in "executed" or "sent for execution" status and you will get an updated 
memo next week confirming this.

In cleaning up our lotus notes this week, I noticed that several agreements 
were not on your list but remain unexecuted.  Can you let me know whether or 
not they remain a priority or interest?  If so, let me know so I can proceed 
on them during the first week in April (at which time I predict ALL of the 
other Agreements will be executed).

They include:

RBC Dominion Securities Corp.  (ECTI)

Sakura Dellsher, Inc.  (not sure which Enron company)

Societe General  (ENA)

BuySideDirect (ENA)

Merrill Lynch (ENA)

Tom, you had informed me that we needed to hold off on executing the other 
agreements negotiated for Enron Credit Inc. until the Bear Stearns account 
was opened.  Can I now proceed with opening the other accounts?  Please 
advise that nothing has changed.

Sara:

I received the list from Aneela.   The brokerage agreements marked on her 
list as priority were ones that I too had already marked as priority and 
hence, the same ones that Stephanie, Sam and I have been pushing, at the 
latest, since last week.  One of the agreements, ITG, was sent for execution 
today -- we were awaiting Mark Haedicke's approval for an exeption and 
received it this morning.  I conveyed all of this to Aneela earlier today.  
In most cases, the ball is in the court on the other side so I think from our 
end, I think from our end, we have been working diligently to get these 
agreements executed as soon as possible.  At the moment, I do not think that 
we need to meet again.

Hi Stephanie, 

I thought the execution process was complete on this one but actually we are 
still in the process of executing.  DBAB has sent to us two copies signed by 
them and hence, ready for our signatures.  I am forwarding to you so that you 
could get the signatures and prepare the Authorized Officers List and the 
Consent Form for signatures as well.  

Cassandra wants an explanatory blurb about why the account is necessary, 
please check in to get some justification from Aneela, Sheila or Theresa.

Thank you,

Hello everyone,

Here are some updates since our meeting and some follow through points:

1. Today I received access to lotus notes and instructions on how to use it 
for the purpose of tracking our agreements.  this should greatly improve the 
efficiency of our work on this project. 

2. I received confirmation that on Monday that we should have final drafts of 
the Raymond James and Robertson Stephens Brokerage Agreements ready for 
signatures.  Sam is preparing the accompanying documents for R/J.  Stephanie, 
can you prepare those for R/S?  R/S is a high priority agreement.  Thank you.

3.  This morning we finally received comments from Jefferies & Co.  I will 
review them on Monday.

4.  Psytech Analytics, an added high priority agreement, was sent to Sheila 
Glover for final execution.

5. I got written confirmation that ING Barings was executed, from their 
perspective.


******To update our status memo, let me know if anyone else has any other 
updates they would like for me to add.  As per our discussion at the meeting, 
I will draft the checklist memo to the folks downstairs this afternoon and 
distribute it to you guys to see if there is anything you want to add.

Sara, my calendar says we have two brokerage meetings for tomorrow.  You and 
I may have set up one individual one and then apparently there is a team 
meeting.  I do not think we need to meet twice so maybe we should just all 
meet in the afternoon, right?

Stephanie, 

I have asked a couple of times but still have not heard back from you about 
what happened to the Goldman Sachs completed agreements I gave you on 
Thursday 10th to get signatures and send to Goldman.  When Tom and I spoke 
this morning he expressed angst that Goldman did not have the Agreement yet.  
Can you tell me today where those documents are and whether or not they went 
out to Goldman?

Keegan is going to forward to you some documents sent by ISI.  The document=
s ae part of a prime broker agreement that ENA has to have in place with Be=
ar so that ISI can clear the trades.  The attached agreement is a boiler pl=
ate vanilla agreement.  Please check the files and Lotus Notes to determine=
 whether ENA has an executed agreement for the account number noted on the =
documents.  Also, please clarify the matter one way or the other with ISI a=
nd Bear by calling, among others, the names listed on the top of the agreem=
etn.  These are the folks at Bear that ISI is dealing with, and who say tha=
t they have no record of an agreement.  I would think we already have an ag=
reement and if not, we do not want to sue the boilerplate -- we would at le=
ast use an edited version of the agreement I have on file which we have suc=
cessfully negotiated with other parties.  If you have any questions please =
let me know.  Please also update lotus notes to reflect what you find.  (A =
while back, Bear goofed when John Galloti got confused and sent us a copy o=
f an executing agreement or boilerplate -- please note that we want to send=
 to ISI a copy of a prime broker agreement between ENA and Bear). =20

Also, Keegan or I will forward to you today or tomorrow the agreement that =
I have just negotiated with CFSB.  Please add a lotus notes entry for this =
clearing agreemetn.  Note that we sent commetns on 5/11 and had to resend t=
hem.  We had a conference call today in which we settled on the final versi=
on of the agreement.  Thanx.

Sara, fyi, here is a copy of the second email I had previously sent to Sam 
and Stephanie making sure that they are updating lotus notes after I forward 
the emails to them.  I just want to make sure that you know that I am being 
proactive on my own to get this project done.  Sam and Stephanie are charged 
with updating lotus notes and calling those counterparties who are sitting on 
our comments.  I am completing the legal review and negotiating to get them 
executed.  I am communicating with Sam and Stephanie on progress on a daily 
basis.

Hey ladies,

Sam, I think in the end, you were working on Bear Stearns Brokerage 
Agreement, right?  Sheila Glover's group has identified this as a major 
piriority so please call or email the folks over there again today to find 
out the status of their review of our comments.  Then, make sure that lotus 
notes is updated.

Stephanie, I copied you on the Raymond James email as a reminder to update 
lotus notes on that brokerage agreement.

I know you all are extra busy, so thanx especially for making sure these two 
agreements do not fall through the cracks.

Aneela, could you call the business folks on the other side re: the following 
brokerage agreements to find out if they could give their lawyers some gentle 
reminders about returning legal comments to us:

 - Simmons

 - JP Morgan - Electronic Trading Agreement

-  Frost Securities

There may be others but these  come to mind immediately.

Also, it would not hurt to have the business person at Robertson Stephens 
contacted to indicated that the lawyers reached an agreement on the terms but 
we are waiting for Alberto Delgadillo to send back a final version for 
signature and to find out when this is going to be done.

Thanx.

Hi Sara, Anna and I have recommended that you call her to give your 
perspective on an outstanding concern that Anna maintains with respect to the 
Assignment Agreement.  Anna and her MD want specifically to discuss the 
substance of the Exhibit that you would like to attach to the Agreement.    
Call me first so that if I am not at lunch (I am leaving for a late lunch in 
the next fifteen minutes) I can join in.  Otherwise, please call Anna 
directly at 212-272-2727.

Sara:

I received the list from Aneela.   The brokerage agreements marked on her
list as priority were ones that I too had already marked as priority and
hence, the same ones that Stephanie, Sam and I have been pushing, at the
latest, since last week.  One of the agreements, ITG, was sent for
execution today -- we were awaiting Mark Haedicke's approval for an
exeption and received it this morning.  I conveyed all of this to Aneela
earlier today.  In most cases, the ball is in the court on the other side
so I think from our end, I think from our end, we have been working
diligently to get these agreements executed as soon as possible.  At the
moment, I do not think that we need to meet again.

ECI Brokerage Agreement: Anna and I completed negotiations on the agreement 
and she agreed las t week to implement the changes by today.

Assignment: Anna and I have a scheduled conference call today to resolve any 
outstanding issues.  If you talked to her today, please let me know before I

I know that you have been negotiating with Cheryl Nelson about the new ECI

some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting.

Can we execute the ECI agreement today?  
Have we agreed on the assignment?
Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities 
Loan Agreement?
Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already 
requested.  I'll check on the expedited delivery date.

Please call me when you receive this email.  Thanks very much for your

Stephanie, I have completed the legal review for this Agreement and I think 
we will move quickly on it.

Can you work with me on this one to prepare for execution?  Here is what we 
need:

(FYI, This one is a true trading agreeement, not a platform agreement. )

1. Can you check whether we have in place a clearing broker agreement for ECT 
Investments.  Let me know, I wanted to confirm this before sending the legal 
comments.

2.  Backtracking, confirm with Aneela that we want an agreement for just ECTI 
or ENA as well.  (Her sheet says just ECTI).

3. If we do not have the clearing agreement set up, can you prepare the docs 
by early next week?  I should have an executed version to pass on to you next 
week for signature.

4.  I did not see a lotus notes entry so can you set one up? or, two, if 
Aneela wants one for ENA as well?

Thanx for all your help.

While you were out , I doublechecked them and we have everything correct and

I spoke with Mark and Tana about whether we could proceed with getting signatures for the Enron Credit Inc. documents we need to open the account today.  They said that Mark also initialed a second document authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.  Please check Sara's and Marie's desk to see if you can find the document.

Sheila, attached is a revised version of the agreement -- most of the changes 
reflect the revisions that we added to the final version of Pystech.  Two 
quick additional issues to doublecheck:

1. I assume that based on the short term of the agreement, you did not want 
to include the right to terminate the agreement at any time?  (the draft does 
not so say -- so let me know if you want to add this).

2.  The Agreement indicates that payment is $30,000 a month but the term is 
for 10 weeks or so.  So, do you want me to add a statement that this amount 
will be pro-rated?   I ASSUMED SO - SEE EDITS.  Do we mean $30,000 every 30 
days on a pro-rated basis or will he get the full sum for the "month" of 
August?

In case these are non-issues, here is the revised version.  Please review and 
let me know if it is okay and I will send an initialed version down to you.

Please do a legal review of this Contractor Service Contract.  The agreement

If possible, I would like to get this turned around today.

Sara, 

As a courtesy, Bear Stearns permitted us to open the Prime Broker Account 
without receipt of the resolutions provided that we sent them under separate 
cover.  This was necessary because I needed to get more firm approval on the 
slate of officers that Richard Sage had communicated to me and Stephanie.  

The question of whether the consents were drafted to provide for Repos is new 
to me since I do not recall that you and I discuss this during the process of 
opening the accounts.  However, in any case, if necessary, we could easily 
and quickly edit the resolutions today and send them overnight to Bear to 
make explicit that we would want to use Bear for financing any repos.  Again, 
I am not sure if this is what we want to do since we have not discussed it, 
but let me know.

If I can be of any further assistance today, let me know.  I had planned to 
leave at 5:30 p.m. but can rearrange my schedule if you need any help with 
any thing.

I am assuming that you are saying that if repos go through the Prime Broker 
accounts it is a problem.  The poblem being that the current brokerage 
agreements for ECI do not provide for repos.  Is my assumption correct?

Is our UCD adequate as is for repos?

What is our existing format that you mention below?

Are you able to pursue this with Goldman right now today?

Thanks,

Tom

Tom:

I am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse 
repurchase transactions and securities lending, bonds borrow pledge, etc. as 
the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of 
transactions.  However, if the repo party will accept our existing format, 
then we need not worry.  I'll call Ted Leh and try to find the proper Goldman 
person.

Sara,

Can you please provide your findings on the following items:

1. Determine with Cheryl that ECI is in fact authorized to transact Repos

2. How robust the Goldman Repo agreements are, and their sutability to ECI.

3. An estimate on how long it will take to set up the Goldman Repo Agreements 
in ECI's name.


Can you please also provide any ideas how ECI or ECL could transact a Repo 
trade today using existing documentation.


London has indicated an urgent need to carry out these transactions.

Thanks,

Tom

Stephanie, 

I have asked a couple of times but still have not heard back from you about what happened to the Goldman Sachs completed agreements I gave you on Thursday 10th to get signatures and send to Goldman.  When Tom and I spoke this morning he expressed angst that Goldman did not have the Agreement yet.  Can you tell me today where those documents are and whether or not they went out to Goldman?

Hi Paris, I hope your dental work was not too painful.  As per my voicemail messages, we also still need to discuss my comments to your comments re: Ocean Energy's ISDA.  Perhaps we can discuss this when we finish with Devon via conference call.   We may have a call scheduled for tomorrow on the latter.  Can we discuss them back to back?

Sara, if you have already negotiated one for Morgan today then we should just 
use the same for Goldman so I will leave it to you as per our earlier

Hello Team, 

I have good news.  Clem Abrams approved the guaranty and will have it 
executed first thing tomorrow.  (None of the requisite officers are in today).

I am still contacting Bear Stearns every couple of hours to get the final 
drafts of the agreements in our hands.  I'll keep you posted.

Hi Sara and Sheila, 

By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's 
lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and 
assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting 
for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward 
it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every 
hour or so for a status update.

Tom,
The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.  

Sara,
Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from 
anyone?

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

		 Subject: BEAR Guarantee letter

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. ("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday of last week.

Marie, I am forwarding to you for Brokerage files

1. A copy of the executed copy of the Javelin Technologies Agreement that was 
faxed to me.  We need to follow up to get the original.  In the meantime, 
we'll put this doc in the executed file.

2.  A copy of the ECI - Bear Stearns guaranty that I had faxed to the office 
while I was in New York.

Also, Stephanie, reminder that I believe that we still have not sent a signed 
Tax Form to Bear re: Enron Credit Inc.  (although we did so for Morgan).  In 
any case, Mike Bruegel at Bear says he does not have it.  Please send one to 
him.  His phone number is 312-663-3253.  This did not affect the opening of 
the account but they still need it.  Please make sure that in fact we also 
sent one to Goldman.

Hey Stephanie, I can see that you are super super swamped, so I am trying to 
help by doing some of the paralegal work to get several of the URGENT 
brokerage agreements done.  I do need your help on the following:

1. As I mentioned earlier today, the last few tasks I left for you for Enron 
Credit Inc. are critical.  I jsut need for you to call that contact to find 
out when they will have the tax I.D. number and let her know that we 
corrected the final slate of officers via Richard Sage and not by the info in 
the system and we want the info in the system updated right away.  We were 
able to get certain key documents to Bear in order to open the account but 
that stunt was contigent on our getting to them the outstanding information 
immediately thereafter and they are calling us on it.  Sara represented to me 
that this work was extremely urgent.  

Sara, maybe you can provide some guidance to Stephanie about whether she 
should put extra focus on these other tasks.

2.  As per my previous emails yesterday and today, please have the documents 
ready for Goldman International by the end of the day Thursday.  


thanx.

Anthony, please return my calls from yesterday as soon as possible.  We do not understand why you sent the draft letter which refers to Enron North America as an Investment Advisor to Enron Credit Inc. as I do not believe anyone here made such a representation to anyone at Morgan Stanley.  As indicated in my previous correspondences, Enron Credit Inc., in its own right, wishes to open an account with Morgan.  We need to know whether you can help us to do so right away.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she always knows how to reach me.

Brian also confirmed that we have sent the executed documents to Terry Finn

I received the referenced agreement in inter-office mail.  According to

K, I know we were waiting for Stephanie to get back to us but in the interim can you update the report -- create a new version to reflect the following changes:

SNL -- Comments have been sent.

CSFB -- we executed an agreement for not only ENA BUT ALSO ECT INVESTMENTS.

Let me know when these changes have been made so that I can decide whether to send out the agreement with or without any feedback from anyone else.

Thanx a lot.

Hi Selena, 

I received a phone call today from ITG indicating that their business persons 
overlooked a step in the procedural/legal process of getting Quantex 
installed.  As you know, I executed the NASDAQ, AMEX etc. agreements that 
accompanied the Quantex agreement itself.  ITG indicated that they never 
faxed to us one more of these such agreements that has to get done and that 
they are going to fax it on Monday when the requisite operations person 
returns.  Once this last statement is executed on Monday they will be able to 
stall the equipment.  

They further indicated that, in practical terms, there overnight should not 
cause any further delay because they are just shipping the equipment today 
for installation on Monday or Tuesday.  I will keep you posted.  

Feel free to call me Monday afternoon for an update and to insure that we are 
getting this last agreement executed.

Julie, if I have any business-IT questions, I will call you on Monday.  I 
anticipate that in light of all the other agreements, everything will be 
straight forward and I will get the agreement reviewed and executed pretty 
quickly.

Hi Sara, attached, as per your request, is a copy of the most updated list.  

Reminder that if you do not receive a copy, you can always go into the legal directory and get it.  Look in o:\legal\CNelson\brokerage agreements -status reports.  Then, note that the name of each document reflects the date it was created.  So, the doc below was done last week on May 23rd.

We are now ready to execute a prime broker account agreement with SB for 
ENA.  This is a prerequisite for opening the electronic agreement.  Stephanie
, I will forward the agreement to you for signatures first thing in the 
morning.

Sheila, can you forward to me a brief explanation as to why the electronic 
agreement is important.  Cassandra Schultz reminded me this week that these 
are critical in order for her to authorize the opening of the account.

The electronic agreement should be ready for execution next week.

We have a executing broker agreement in Legal for CSFB currently.  London needs this additional information because they house accounts in UK separately.  We trade with CSFB on both sides of the pond as ECT Investments Inc.  London is just looking for documentation which states ECT Investments Inc. is a wholly owned sub of Enron Corp (via Enron North America).
 
Please do not hesitate to call if you would like to discuss.

Hey Sara, thanx for your words of encouragement.  It is very important to me 
that you think that I am doing a good job, the positive feedback offsets all 
the frantic calls from the people downstairs.  

The Authroized Traders List for Enron Credit Inc. is done -- we really just 
need to finalize the agreements with the brokers which i think can happen 
quickly since we are not trying to reinvent the wheel.  

I just realized that my conference call with Anna is 10 New York time and 
then I have a conference call with Claude on his deal. So, I am going to get 
on your calendar tomorrow but it might not be until late morning, not first 
thing.  At the meeting, I can let you know where we stand with the other 
tasks.

Hello Sara, 

Keegan told me that you had asked her today to send to you an updated 
Brokerage Agreement Status Report.   We (the legal eagles) and the business 
folks agreed at the last meeting on 3/28 that I would distribute the report 
every two weeks - every other Thursday.  This works best for me and Keegan.  
Under that schedule, Keegan and I have planned that the report would be ready 
for group-wide distribution this Thursday.

Hi Sara & Tom,

Sara, I stopped by your office to discuss ECI but you are in a meeting.  

As per our discussion yesterday, I had a scheduled conference call with Anna 
Meytina of Bear Stearns to discuss ECI.  (Sara, the call was not at 1:30 but 
rather took place before noon today).   In light of our calls with Anna, here 
is where we stand:

1. Brokerage Agreement: I asked her how we are doing on getting the final 
draft of the Agreement to me.  She indicated that she was trying to send a 
redlined version today as promised.  She still has get approval on the 
arbitration provision and limited liability provision from her Managing 
Director.  this is what is manily holding up the process, not any lack of 
diligence on our part.

2.  Assignment: Anna and I discussed my comments to the Assignment Agreement 
-- she agreed to make all of the changes and to do so by the end of the day.  

3.  Guaranty: Anna and I have a scheduled conference call to discuss my 
comments to the redlined guaranty she sent back to me.

Anna represented that, in light of the hold-up from her Managing Director, it 
was unlikely that she could get any agreement signed by the end of the day 
today but agreed that Wednesday was a realistic possibility.

Marie, I am forwarding to you for Brokerage files

1. A copy of the executed copy of the Javelin Technologies Agreement that was faxed to me.  We need to follow up to get the original.  In the meantime, we'll put this doc in the executed file.

2.  A copy of the ECI - Bear Stearns guaranty that I had faxed to the office while I was in New York.

Also, Stephanie, reminder that I believe that we still have not sent a signed Tax Form to Bear re: Enron Credit Inc.  (although we did so for Morgan).  In any case, Mike Bruegel at Bear says he does not have it.  Please send one to him.  His phone number is 312-663-3253.  This did not affect the opening of the account but they still need it.  Please make sure that in fact we also sent one to Goldman.

   Hi Cheryl,

   I haven't had a response to our queries about putting in place an
ISDA
   between Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. and our

   Dear Cheryl,

   I've again had inquiries from our Geneva affiliate, Cargill

   with Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  Are
   you still the attorney who would be handling this Agreement?

   Dear Sara & Cheryl,

   I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
   International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
   them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

   There had been some question as to which Enron entity
   was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
   information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
   office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
   & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
   International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

   Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
   confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
   whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
   also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
   done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
   get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

Hi Sara.  

With all due respect Sara, I have a constructive suggestion for both of us. 
In Anna's view, and I agree, it is causing some unnecessary confusion that 
you call her to negotiate provisions of the contract that I am negotiating 
with her without my knowledge.  It makes both you and I look disorganized and 
in doing so, I beleive it undermines our position in negotiating the terms.   
As a practical matter, it is extrmemly difficult to negotiate a contract and 
administratively organize the execution if I am not sure whether there is 
someone else taking steps (especially with outside counsel that I am not 
aware of.)   If you have asked me to negotiate an agreement -- as in the case 
of Enron Credit Inc. -- and you have an update on the status -- having sat in 
on the conference call on Friday, then why not let me do so?  At the very 
least, could you call me first for an update or try to include me in the 
call. 

Equally important, while I am sure that it is not your intent, you are 
undermining my morale.  I have constantly kept you updated  -- sometimes on 
an hourly basis -- on the status of what is going on with all of the 
administrative and legal tasks.   To call outside counsel under those 
circumstances  comes across as a vote of no confidence in my work and efforts 
which is baffling to me because I think I have worked hard and have 
accomplished a tremendous amount with respect to the brokerage agreement 
project.   I have negotiated these agreements with a great deal of 
thoughtfulness and skill. I have gone above and beyond even to determine 
applicable law that no one else was aware of.

Moreover on Friday (again without intending to do so) you undermined my 
morale by telling me that there were administrative tasks that needed to be 
done.  You said that you hope I know that the agreement does not just become 
executed once we sign it.  Sara, it should be obvious to you that I know -- 
perhaps better than anyone else -- what administrative tasks need to be 
accomplished to open this kind of brokerage account.  I have even figured out 
that there are administrative tasks beyond what any one else is aware, for 
example, in the case of the ancillary NASDAQ agreements, that no one else was 
aware had to be completed.  I have proven already that I can execute all of 
the administrative tasks in an expedited manner.  

I want these comments to be taken in the spirit in which they are given -- 
which is that we both mean well and are working toward a common goal and that 
everyone can learn from anyone.  I look forward to talking to you further so 
that we do not let the frantic nature of our work make any one feel that 
their efforts are not valued.

Sheila, attached is a revised version of the agreement -- most of the changes reflect the revisions that we added to the final version of Pystech.  Two quick additional issues to doublecheck:

1. I assume that based on the short term of the agreement, you did not want to include the right to terminate the agreement at any time?  (the draft does not so say -- so let me know if you want to add this).

2.  The Agreement indicates that payment is $30,000 a month but the term is for 10 weeks or so.  So, do you want me to add a statement that this amount will be pro-rated?   I ASSUMED SO - SEE EDITS.  Do we mean $30,000 every 30 days on a pro-rated basis or will he get the full sum for the "month" of August?

In case these are non-issues, here is the revised version.  Please review and let me know if it is okay and I will send an initialed version down to you.

Please do a legal review of this Contractor Service Contract.  The agreement is based on the Psytech agreement which had been previously reviewed by legal.
If possible, I would like to get this turned around today.

Stephanie, from our end, we have executed a brokerage agreement between ECT 
and GSI.  I am forwarding to you the two originals to send back.  If 
possible, please put in the mail today since there is a huge rush on getting 
it back.

The fed ex envelope attached has the address.  Send to Sarah Stowey's 
attention.  

Please make sure that the accompanying documents are all there.  I asked 
Keegan to get Kate Cole's signatures for the Consent Form so please follow up 
to get that form from Keegan.

I will fax a copy of the executed versions to Sarah in London as per her

You may want to clarify this with Keegan as 1) your voice mail was full on that Friday, 2) Keegan tried to contact you in New York and the number she had for you was disconnected, and 3) we tried to locate the documents that Friday and were not able to.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she always knows how to reach me.

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. ("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday of last week.

I see so, in another words the "credit book" consists of -- or is considered 
--- "obligations" etc. but there are no other agreements.  Thanx for 
reiterating.

(1)  The only agreement that ENA is assigning is the Securities Loan 
Agreement.

(2)  Remember, ENA is also assigning the "credit book" (identified in 
Sheila's earlier email and more clearly identified in Tom Doukas' email of 
yesterday which I forwarded to ;you yesterday).

Sara, I am on hold on a conference call but wanted to talk with you about 
some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not 
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know 
it executed).  But for my own understanding:

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the 
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need 
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a 
Securities Loan Agreement?

I can attend the meeting since this will be the third in a series of recent ones I have attended in an ongoing discussion.  I do not want to meet on Monday however.  On Monday, I will talk to Mary to make sure that if there is anything that she or I was to do as follow-up from the last meeting, then it has been done.  Also, if we are all going to attend, then it makes sense for us to have our group meeting first.

Richard Lauer and Mary Nordstrom would like to meet on Monday (or sometime next week) to discuss the risk policy regarding brokerage accounts.  I am happy to meet with them, but don't know how much input I will be able to give them.  Sara, maybe you have some info that I can pass along?

Let me know if you would like to meet with them and, if so, what times you are available.  Or let me know if there is some info I should give to them.

Anthony, please return my calls from yesterday as soon as possible.  We do 
not understand why you sent the draft letter which refers to Enron North 
America as an Investment Advisor to Enron Credit Inc. as I do not believe 
anyone here made such a representation to anyone at Morgan Stanley.  As 
indicated in my previous correspondences, Enron Credit Inc., in its own 
right, wishes to open an account with Morgan.  We need to know whether you 
can help us to do so right away.

Right.  For sure, the authority is not invalidated if the issue is that some 
officer is simply not named, but that is not the main problem whith our 
documents.  In any case, [on this first point], putting Gary's name on the 
list of officers since he is the officer signing will avoid potential 
problems and questions from brokers.  

What WOULD invalidate the authority, however, is if the secretary's statement 
provides that only officers providing certain positions can open accounts and 
no such officers/positions exist.  This is the case with our ENA documents.  
If you look at them you will see that there are obvious errors - in 
particular, read the secretary's statement and note the 
inconsistencies/errors compared to the authorized officers list.  

We need to change these immediately today so I will stop by and talk to you 
and/or Stephanie about what corrections need to be made.

Thanx.

Cheryl:

Just a bit of history:  I think that the partial listing of officers on the 
(authorized traders) list is only meant to be illustrative of corporate 
officers and directors.  The ENA unanimous consent for the relevant company 
is the authority for document execution.  If, for example, a VP is authorized 
to execute for a particular company (by virtue of a corporate resolution or 
unanimous consent) and that particular VP's name does not appear in the 
partial listing, exection is not invalidated.  The execution is valid.

Have you had a broker question ENA's authority?

Hey Stephanie, we need to revise this list because it does not make sense at 
least with respect to ENA.  It does not list key people (e.g. Gary) and it is 
inconsistent with the resolutions.  For example, the resolutions say that a 
managing director and treasurer can be a designated person to open an account 
but ENA does not have such an officer.  There are MD's and then there is a VP 
and Treasurer.  There are I think other inconsistencies we need to clear up 
to avoid having the accounts invalidated.  Having these points clear is 
especially important where, like now, we won't have Gary or Mark Frevert sign 
because they are out of town and we need to open the account right away.  

I know you are swamped so I will work tonight on revising the List for ENA 
tonight and give the revisions to do first thing in the morning.

Can you revise the List for ECT today (or just doublecheck it) so that we do 
not have a hold up in executing the Goldman International account for ECT 
first thing in the morning.  I promised Sheila Glover we would execute it 
right away.

Did we open any ENA accounts in the past two weeks and if so, just to be 
clear, can we send them a list that includes Gary's name and title if he 
signed.

Stephanie, Richard Sage returned my call from Friday and we have determined

will forward the information to you so you can update the list.

Also, Stephanie, is there someone we can call to have them update the

Thanks Cheryl.

I need only ensure the funds we will need in order to meet the margin call at 
Morgan is ready.



David,

I expect the needed margin at Morgan to be under $30mm once we move our longs 
out.  Morgan has today agreed to 25% for shorts (from an average of 50%).  Of 
the $30mm needed half is already at Goldman and Bear.  

I anticipate therefore no more than $15mm in needed funds.  It may in fact be 
less I will true up tomorrow

Can we get this by next week, and allow Cheryl to proceed full steam?



Thanks,

Tom

Hi Tom,  at your request the execution of these agreements have been on 
hold.  Most of the leg work has been done.  I completed the negotiations on 
the agreement so moving forward is a matter of getting a document ready for 
signatures and getting it signed, having lawyers on both side proof read it 
and getting the agreement and accompanying documents (which are complete) 
executed.  This process, which is mainly administrative, could take two or 
three days if I focused on as a priority to make sure it gets done.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Sara & Cheryl,

Could you please provide a status on where we stand on the transfer of the 
Credit book from ENA/ECT to ECI at Goldman and Morgan.

I had previously asked you to hold up on Morgan until the Bear issue was 
resolved.  I am hoping we do not have to much effort ahead of us to move 
these two accounts over.

Thanks,

Cassandra and Cheryl,
 ENA has begun an executing broker relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald.  The 
business purpose for establishing the relationship is because Cantor is a 
market maker in illiquid convertible bonds.  This relationship is for 
execution only.  All settlements will still occur through existing Prime 
Brokers Goldman, Morgan and Bear.  The agreement is to be established for ENA 
only.

Thanks,
Theresa

Thanks Cheryl.

I need only ensure the funds we will need in order to meet the margin call at 
Morgan is ready.



David,

I expect the needed margin at Morgan to be under $30mm once we move our longs 
out.  Morgan has today agreed to 25% for shorts (from an average of 50%).  Of 
the $30mm needed half is already at Goldman and Bear.  

I anticipate therefore no more than $15mm in needed funds.  It may in fact be 
less I will true up tomorrow

Can we get this by next week, and allow Cheryl to proceed full steam?



Thanks,

Tom

Hi Tom,  at your request the execution of these agreements have been on 
hold.  Most of the leg work has been done.  I completed the negotiations on 
the agreement so moving forward is a matter of getting a document ready for 
signatures and getting it signed, having lawyers on both side proof read it 
and getting the agreement and accompanying documents (which are complete) 
executed.  This process, which is mainly administrative, could take two or 
three days if I focused on as a priority to make sure it gets done.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Sara & Cheryl,

Could you please provide a status on where we stand on the transfer of the 
Credit book from ENA/ECT to ECI at Goldman and Morgan.

I had previously asked you to hold up on Morgan until the Bear issue was 
resolved.  I am hoping we do not have to much effort ahead of us to move 
these two accounts over.

Thanks,

Tom

I read Sara's message to mean cancel all the meetings since she said she said 
she had no meetings scheduled on her calendar because the meetings were just 
for the initial stages of the project.

In any case Keegan, do not stress about it.   I know you are trying to do a

Just to confirm,  you mean the 9am meeting tomorrow, not the weekly Brokerage

make any more mistakes with your schedule as a result of my confusion.

Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you 
tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage 
meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring 
ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is 
always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.

Mark/Sara,

We are attempting to get two amendments to the ISDA with AEP right now.  Mark, you are working on the Amendment allowing for EOL Transactions to not need written Confirmations and Sara is working on an amendment that will change the Confirming Party to ENA (for some reason, AEP was allowed to be the Confirming Party when the Master was drafted.)   At any rate, is it possible that we send both of these amendments to AEP at the same time?  We want to make sure that AEP views these amendments together and sign off on both.  We think they'll be more comfortable signing them both at once rather than a couple of weeks apart.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

Hi Sara and Stephanie,

	It is my understanding that the paralegals working on the brokerage accounts are to (1) send documents to counterparties; (2) track their return and (3) keep the fully executed documents received from counterparties in the file cabinet next to Stephanie's office.

	In light of our being short-staffed in light of Samantha's absence, I have tried to be helpful to our team by assisting in preparing the documents for execution & getting some signatures.  I hope that has been helpful.  But once Stephanie [or whichever legal assistant assumes her role] notes that the documents have gone out, then that person should track the documents and be the keeper of records.

Aneela, thank you again for attending our meeting today.  My assistant, 
Keegan Farrell, is going to update the Brokerage Agreement list to reflect 
our report today and distribute it by the end of the day tomorrow.

The updated list will indicate that the agreements completed recently include:

ING Barrings
Lehman
Jeffries
Salomon
Frost (Deutsche Bank)
Simmons
Robertson Stephens
Raymond James
JP Morgan

Perhaps by the end of the week we will have Goldman Sachs International ready 
by Friday and Sanford Bernstein by Monday or Tuesday.  I will keep you 
posted.

Hey Stephanie, I can see that you are super super swamped, so I am trying to 
help by doing some of the paralegal work to get several of the URGENT 
brokerage agreements done.  I do need your help on the following:

1. As I mentioned earlier today, the last few tasks I left for you for Enron 
Credit Inc. are critical.  I jsut need for you to call that contact to find 
out when they will have the tax I.D. number and let her know that we 
corrected the final slate of officers via Richard Sage and not by the info in 
the system and we want the info in the system updated right away.  We were 
able to get certain key documents to Bear in order to open the account but 
that stunt was contigent on our getting to them the outstanding information 
immediately thereafter and they are calling us on it.  Sara represented to me 
that this work was extremely urgent.  

Sara, maybe you can provide some guidance to Stephanie about whether she 
should put extra focus on these other tasks.

2.  As per my previous emails yesterday and today, please have the documents 
ready for Goldman International by the end of the day Thursday.  


thanx.

Hello Sara,

I received your voice message and called you back but you are not available.

My understanding of where we stand is not consistent with yours.  Here is my 
understanding:

Guaranty: Yes, I got the guaranty executed and have it in my possession.

Assignment  Agreement:  No, we do not have a final draft.  As I mentioned on 
Friday, the last version that Anna sent did not have all of the all of the 
edits/changes I had recommended to her implemented.  In particular, the 
arbitration language had not been changed and there were some grammatical 
edits.  I refaxed my comments today; Anna agreed to implement them and I am 
awaiting her draft.  (Anna may not have gotten some faxes on Thursday or 
Friday because her fax number changed when she changed building locations 
last week).  

Account Agreement: Yes, you are correct that Anna has to send back a revised 
draft.  She and I have been clling each other every hour.  Anna said that she 
would get back to me in two hours or so after her meeting on another matter.

Authorized Traders List:  Stephanie had originally taken on this task and 
sent me an email indicating that the list was complete.  Last week, Stephanie 
indicated that the information upon which she relied was no longer in the 
database.  Therefore, there is some confusion as to who the corporate 
officers are.  I called Richard Sage, with whom Stephanie has been in 
contact, for assistance.  He has not called me back so if you had further 
suggestions on how to proceeed, please let me know.

Account & Tax Forms: I have the requisite form -- the same one I have used 
for the same tasks for other new Enron entities - in my possession and am in 
the process of filling them out.  

Logistics: You indicated in your voice message that you were not sure whether 
I had thought logistically about getting the agreement executed.  Let me 
reassure you that I have.  In light of the above, I did not maintain the view 
that all the documents would be ready for signature by noon particularly 
because (1) we do not have in our possession final versions of two of the 
three agreements and (2) I determined on Friday that the Authorized Officers 
List might now be outdated.  I received some emails today disclosing how to 
proceed re: sending the document.  However, as I confirmed with you on 
Friday, I spoke with Mike Bruegel on Thursday and confirmed where to send the 
documents.

When you are available, please let me know so we can update and resolution on 
how to proceed on any outstanding matters.

Keegan is going to forward to you some documents sent by ISI.  The document=

documents.  Also, please clarify the matter one way or the other with ISI a=

Mark/Sara,

We are attempting to get two amendments to the ISDA with AEP right now.  
Mark, you are working on the Amendment allowing for EOL Transactions to not 
need written Confirmations and Sara is working on an amendment that will 
change the Confirming Party to ENA (for some reason, AEP was allowed to be 
the Confirming Party when the Master was drafted.)   At any rate, is it 
possible that we send both of these amendments to AEP at the same time?  We 
want to make sure that AEP views these amendments together and sign off on 
both.  We think they'll be more comfortable signing them both at once rather 
than a couple of weeks apart.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

Hello Team, 

Now that we have sent for execution or executed close to 50 new agreements and we have to refer back to these agreements and documents, it is all the more important that we make sure that the administrative tasks we previously  discussed are in fact accomplished.    I suggest that we schedule a meeting to make sure 

(1) that, as per our previous discussions, Stephanie or whichever legal assistant working on brokerage agreements are tracking the agreements sent out and creating the brokerage agreement files once the Agreements are executed.   Also, we want to make sure everyone knows where to go when you need certain documents/where these files are located and what is supposed to be in them.  (I think they were just moved from Samantha's desk to Stephanie's desk, right?)

(2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes when she receives the documents.

(3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader announcements and changes.  I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give notice when the list of authorized traders changes - this is critical, especially now that there are so many accounts and so many changes.  Maybe we can draft a form letter and have a template or something.  We should also create a list of contact persons to whom such a list has to go to.

(4) Also, now that we have more another legal assistant, we should meet to discuss how the assistant can "take back" some of the tasks I had taken on to make life easier without such help - getting signatures, preapring the documents, calling the counterparty etc.  This will free-up some much needed time to review ISDA's, Confirms etc.

(5) Which legal assistants will work on what?

Sara may have additional topics, this is just some of immediate concern.

Hi Stephanie, could you let me know where we stand with getting execution 
signatures for the following brokerage agreements:

Sanford Bernstein - executing broker

Merrill Lynch -- executing broker

(they have been marked "sent for execution" on the legal status report) as 
well as any others we have sent since our last meeting.  Since we will no 
longer meet as frequently, please send me an email as soon as we get 
agreements fully executed so that I can update the list.

Hi Sheila, 

Selena Gonzalez called me a week or so and brought this letter to my attention asking whether I could work on it and if so, she would explain the ITG agreement and process.  I told her that I would be happy to do so and she did not have to give me any backgroundsince I was the attorney who negotiated both the ITG Master Agreement for Gary's group as well as legal documents related to the installation process.  


I left you a message to discuss Section E below, although I would like to discuss it in light of my comments to ITG (as opposed to the draft they sent).  There is nothing new for us to do with respect to E because I have already submitted on the group's behalf the requisite legal documents to AMEX, NASD etc.  I completed and submitted the legal documents for you on this issue a few months ago.  The Letter below is just stating that we will fulfill our legal obligations to do  -- which we have already done.  (As ITG has explained, they were supposed to have us sign this letter before we completed all the procedures.  I figured out the legal prerequisites for us and got everything done.

Hi Sara, I hope that you (& your car) are okay and safe in light of the floods.  

By way of update, I am trying my best to get the ISDA comparison done by tomorrow and am hoping although not sure that it can get done before you go on vacation.  On Friday, I had several unanticipated meetings/emergencies and then had to leave work at 6:30 -- earlier than I had anticipated -- in light of the rain.  In light of the flooding, I was not able to get back to the office and the file over the weekend as I had planned.  This morning I have another urgent emergency  -- I was just made aware that we absolutely have to get a brokerage agreement executed for Enron Credit Inc. today so I have to focus on getting that done.  

My extended family here are down two cars due to the flooding so I might have to leave work at about 5:30 today to make sure that I can meet my ride to get home safely.

I am sure that I can take the file home tonight to work on the issues but I am not sure whether I will be finished.

Hello Team, 

Now that we have sent for execution or executed close to 50 new agreements

(2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal 
assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes 
when she receives the documents.

(3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader 
announcements and changes.  I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also 
needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give

Hi Sara, 

(1) For clarification, my voicemail was not full on Friday - I checked it, got several messages including one fromTom Doukas and called him and others immediately as I arrived.  My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the calls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due to the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am working on so I do try to clear the box daily.

(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that you get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much about where I keep particular files or documents.  

(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt uncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  (The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  

Equally important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I think they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or sick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not required.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the information you are getting is accurate.

Cheryl:

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. ("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday of last week.

Stephanie, I will have Keegan prepare the fed ex labels  for Bear, Goldman 
International and Sanford Bernstein. You can insert the cover letter, 
doublecheck everything and send them out.  I have already sent faxed copies 
where requested.

Keegan, please also prepare for us two fed ex envelopes/packages to John and 
Christine as per the instructions in the email below.  Keegan, I am going to 
forward to you documents to make copes -- put the copies of the docs in the 
package for John.  The originals go to Christine.  As with all, do not send 
-- give to Stephanie - she has to insert her cover letter and we have to 
insert the signed letter from Kate Cole.

Christine, as a follow-up from yesterday, I wanted to pose a reasonable
solution that addresses your concerns and mine. I negotiated the following
language for a similar agreement:

ENRON SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS THEY RESULT FROM ENRON'S WILLFUL VIOLATION OF ANY OF
THE ______ PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.   (Insert the provisions that
raise any particular IT or other concerns for you).

Hey Sara, Keegan stopped by my office right before lunch to indicate that you 
had requested from her the updated brokerage list.  But reminder that I have 
the updated list and have an updated version.  Reminder that Keegan will not 
start updating the list until after today's meeting.  When I talked to Aneela 
by phone today, I gave her an update and reminded her that she would get a 
formally updated list after today's meeting.  Also, as I indicated yesterday, 
most of the agreements on the list -- the vast majority -- have been executed.

I stopped by your office a few times but you seem to have gone to lunch so I 
am leaving a version on your chair.

I received the referenced agreement in inter-office mail.  According to

Right, neither the file nor Aneela's list indicated that we wanted such an 
account; we only determined that we'd need such an account when I 
doublechecked with Aneela yesterday.  Can you enter in lotus notes or catch 
me while you are doing it so I can see how it is done?

Regarding the J.P. Morgan electronic agreements in connection with the 
existing brokerage accounts, ECT Investments has an account with J.P. Morgan 
but I see no record of an account with ENA either in Lotus Notes or in the

Sara, if you have already negotiated one for Morgan today then we should just use the same for Goldman so I will leave it to you as per our earlier discussion.

Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you 
tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage 
meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring 
ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is 
always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.

Stephanie,  Gary and Cassandra signed this agreement but overlooked the 
signature page for the addendum.  I will take care of resending it to Gary's 
assistant for the additional signature and she will forward it to Mary.

Annela and Mary can you help us look out for it on Monday to make sure we get 
it back to send out promptly?  Please forward the agreement back to Stephanie.

Hello Teammates,

Does any one have a contact name and phone number for a business person at 
the RBC with whom I could talk to get this agreement executed?  Lotus Notes 
indicates that the contact person is Robert Nixon but the last entry was made 
in 1998.  I faxed comments to him a few weeks ago but did not hear back; each 
time I call, I get a busy signal so the line might not be in use.  So before 
I go hunting in the RBC company directory, does any one have another contact 
person?

Hi Sara and Sheila, 

By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's 
lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and 
assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting 
for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward 
it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every 
hour or so for a status update.

Tom,
The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.  

Sara,
Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from 
anyone?

Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Re: BEAR Guarantee letter  

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

Sara, 

Moreover, with the exception of the email dated on the 20th, the other emails 
are not addressed to me; indeed, a major concern of mine which clearly slowed 
down the execution of this package of agreements  was that I was not included 
in conversations about the status and any change in deadlines etc.  Perhaps 
in part that is because for the bulk of the time period in which we worked on 
Enron Credit Inc., you took responsibility for the Bear Stearns agreements 
until you turned the agreements over to me at 3 p.m. on Friday the 12th and I 
began, at that time a legal review of the agreements.  Moreover, no one 
represented to me at that time that this agreement had to be done first and 
right away.  I just learned that last week from the business people when I 
reported that the Morgan agreements were ready for execution.  I had 
completed my review of the other two Enron Credit Inc. account agreements.  
Furthermore, you indicated that I should keep the paralegals involved; my 
records of this project indicate that you asked Stephanie to complete the 
Authorized Officers list, and that you had signed off on it.

All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
steps of which I am aware.
I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in
etc

Thanks,
Richard

Sara, I have stopped by your office but you are not around.  Please provide 
the following information/clarification in light of your conversations with 
other folks:

1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents 
with the agreements to get things moving?

2.  If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get 
this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has 
advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like 
Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project.

3. Re: this attorney Cheryl at Bear  that you have talked to -- what is her 
full name, phone, and fax?


Thanx.

K, I know we were waiting for Stephanie to get back to us but in the interim can you update the report -- create a new version to reflect the following changes:

SNL -- Comments have been sent.

CSFB -- we executed an agreement for not only ENA BUT ALSO ECT INVESTMENTS.

Let me know when these changes have been made so that I can decide whether to send out the agreement with or without any feedback from anyone else.

Thanx a lot.

Welcome Back Stephanie.

While you were out, I prepared "execution packages" for several brokerage 
agreements.   I will forward to you the remaining ones  that need to be sent 
out today and Monday.  (See yesterday's email and report).

Please check the package to make sure everything is there and mail the 
originals SSB agreements to Sharon at the address on the top of the

Goldman is one of the brokers "messed up" in Lotus Notes.  I had given you

agreement in Lotus Notes for ECT Inv. and Goldman Int'l.

Sara/Cheryl,
 ECT Investments Inc has received a faxed document from Goldman Sachs 
International  regarding terms of business for executing equity transactions 
through the London office.  This document is not intended for the purposes of 
opening up a new executing broker accouunt with Goldman Sachs International.  
ECT Investments Inc currently has an existing executing broker agreement with 
Goldman Sachs & Co which should cover trades done in Houston and London since 
we are trading under the same legal entity.  The Terms of Business Letter 
sets forths terms and conditions that would apply to transactions executed by 
ECT Investments in London which is governed under the SFA rules and 
regulations.
 I will forward a copy of the document to Cheryl.  Goldman Sachs 
International is waiting for us to review and sign.  If you have additional 
questions and concerns, I can be reached at extension 31439.


Thanks,

Cassandra and Cheryl,
 ENA has begun an executing broker relationship with Cantor Fitzgerald.  The 
business purpose for establishing the relationship is because Cantor is a 
market maker in illiquid convertible bonds.  This relationship is for 
execution only.  All settlements will still occur through existing Prime 
Brokers Goldman, Morgan and Bear.  The agreement is to be established for ENA 
only.

Thanks,
Theresa

Sara, I confirmed with Mike Bruegel  that he will be opening the account for 
us and has understood this since Tom Doukas and I addressed this issue 
yesterday.  I will edit your lotus notes entry to reflect this correction.

Also, he asked me whether I knew what documents have to accompany the 
agreement.  I told him yes, since I do this all the time.  I have in my 
electronic file folder the blank account form and tax form.  If you would 
like for me to send electronic copes to you if you do not have copies then 
let me know.

That is wonderful.  However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not 
been advised of the pending changes.  It would seem to me it will still take 
time for Bear to make the adjustment to the account.

This will likely delay getting the margin relief we so desperately need.

Could you please confirm that they are ready to fully enact the agreement and 
lower the margin requirements as of tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tom

		 Subject: Urgent Task List for Enron Credit Inc. - Assignment of  Accounts 

Stephanie, in the event that we do not meet today, I am sending this email.  
I figured out what we need to do to to get started on the Enron Credit 
Accounts:

1. One thing we will have to do is open up PRIME brokerage accounts for Enron 
Credit Inc. with each of the 3 different brokers.  So we have to preapre an 
authorized traders list for Enron Credit Inc.  Please call Richard Sage to 
find out if there are particular names we should use for the various officers 
or whether they are simply the same as for ENA.  Sheila Glover might also 
have some say, find out who knows who the officers of Enron Credit Inc. are. 

2.  Then please prepare the Authorized Traders list.  Make sure that the 
phone numbers for the folks we put on the list is update.  Do not rely on 
People finder.  Confirm with their assistants.  

3.  Please have Richard Sage or the appropriate contact person for the tax ID 
number, address number and Classification (corporation, partnership, limited 
liability co.) for Enron Credit Inc.  We will need this to fill out the tax 
form and the Prime Brokerage New Account Information Form.  

4.  Please get a W-9 Taxpayer I.D. form and fill out once you get the above 
info.  Under part II, I think that we'll want to put "EXEMPT" but we'll want 
to doublecheck this with some tax folks once we get the information we need.

5.  We will have to prepare a Form of Assignment.  But we will do that after 
we get the abovementioned and other forms together.

I will work on the Prime Agreement and the Unanimous Consent Form next week.  
Please forward the above information to me by Tuesday afternoon.  (Monday is 
a holiday and I am out of the office tomorrow)

Hello Team, 

Now that we have sent for execution or executed close to 50 new agreements and we have to refer back to these agreements and documents, it is all the more important that we make sure that the administrative tasks we previously  discussed are in fact accomplished.    I suggest that we schedule a meeting to make sure 

(1) that, as per our previous discussions, Stephanie or whichever legal assistant working on brokerage agreements are tracking the agreements sent out and creating the brokerage agreement files once the Agreements are executed.   Also, we want to make sure everyone knows where to go when you need certain documents/where these files are located and what is supposed to be in them.  (I think they were just moved from Samantha's desk to Stephanie's desk, right?)

(2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes when she receives the documents.

(3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader announcements and changes.  I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give notice when the list of authorized traders changes - this is critical, especially now that there are so many accounts and so many changes.  Maybe we can draft a form letter and have a template or something.  We should also create a list of contact persons to whom such a list has to go to.

(4) Also, now that we have more another legal assistant, we should meet to discuss how the assistant can "take back" some of the tasks I had taken on to make life easier without such help - getting signatures, preapring the documents, calling the counterparty etc.  This will free-up some much needed time to review ISDA's, Confirms etc.

(5) Which legal assistants will work on what?

Sara may have additional topics, this is just some of immediate concern.

      Dear Cheryl,

      I've again had inquiries from our Geneva affiliate, Cargill

      with Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  Are

      Cheryl,

      Cargill International, S.A. confirms that they would like to put
an
      ISDA Master Agreement in place with Enron Capital & Trade
Resources
      International Corp.   This is the Enron entity with which they're

      Dear Sara & Cheryl,

      I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
      International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
      them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

      There had been some question as to which Enron entity
      was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
      information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
      office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
      & Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
      International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

      Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
      confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
      whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
      also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
      done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
      get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

      Thanks and Regards,

Teammates, It is obviously a good idea if I am kept in the loop  about what 
is going on with respect to any of the brokerage account projects and 
assignments or we figure out a way to clarify the recurring confusion on who 
is working on what or what the status of the projects are.   In the meeting 
yesterday Stephanie, you stated that you had not gotten any feedback on this 
project yet and therefore had not started any of the tasks.  But now you are 
saying that everything is done and Sara has reviewed it.  When did that 
happen and why did you not send it to me to review?   Did I miss something?  
Have any other of our plans with respect to this project changed?

I suggest that at our next meeting we set aside time for everyone to discuss 
any concerns or -- quite frankly frustrations -- any of us have about working 
on this project along with suggestions on how to better accomplish our goals.

Per your attached memo, I thought that you were working on the Prime 
Agreements.  I have prepared the Authorized Traders List with input from 
Richard Sage and Sheila, which Sara has reviewed.  We are working with 
Richard Kerr on the tax id information.  We need to move forward on these

Subject: Urgent Task List for Enron Credit Inc. - Assignment of  Accounts 

Stephanie, in the event that we do not meet today, I am sending this email.  
I figured out what we need to do to to get started on the Enron Credit 
Accounts:

1. One thing we will have to do is open up PRIME brokerage accounts for Enron 
Credit Inc. with each of the 3 different brokers.  So we have to preapre an 
authorized traders list for Enron Credit Inc.  Please call Richard Sage to 
find out if there are particular names we should use for the various officers 
or whether they are simply the same as for ENA.  Sheila Glover might also 
have some say, find out who knows who the officers of Enron Credit Inc. are. 

2.  Then please prepare the Authorized Traders list.  Make sure that the 
phone numbers for the folks we put on the list is update.  Do not rely on 
People finder.  Confirm with their assistants.  

3.  Please have Richard Sage or the appropriate contact person for the tax ID 
number, address number and Classification (corporation, partnership, limited 
liability co.) for Enron Credit Inc.  We will need this to fill out the tax 
form and the Prime Brokerage New Account Information Form.  

4.  Please get a W-9 Taxpayer I.D. form and fill out once you get the above 
info.  Under part II, I think that we'll want to put "EXEMPT" but we'll want 
to doublecheck this with some tax folks once we get the information we need.

5.  We will have to prepare a Form of Assignment.  But we will do that after 
we get the abovementioned and other forms together.

I will work on the Prime Agreement and the Unanimous Consent Form next week.  
Please forward the above information to me by Tuesday afternoon.  (Monday is 
a holiday and I am out of the office tomorrow)

Sam,

We are moving forward to execute the ITG Quantex agreement now that the final 
revisions were approved.  Sheila has forwarded a revised version of the 
document for Gary Hickerson to sign.  Please make sure that, once Gary signs 
the two copies, they are both forwarded to Cassandra Shultz for signature.  
Then, I think, Selena said she would send to ITG, but make sure.

I am hoping we get signatures tomorrow; I will be out of the office all day 
tomorrow -- traveling to New York and will not return until 10 a.m. Tuesday 
morning (Monday being a holiday).

Sara, I completed review of the Bear Stearns agreement and re-reviewed the 
others on Friday.  I will find you in the late afternoon to discuss after I 
get out of a meeting this afternoon.  

Friday was a marathon day for brokerage agreements -- we stopped the clock on 
almost everything to completed JP Morgan almost from start to finish before 
their lawyer went on a two week vacation.

I hope you enjoyed Florida and the wedding!

Sheila,
 By now you should have received our account documents from Tania
Wilson. The commission rates you were asking for are as follows. All futures
products are $9.00, roundturn, inclusive of all exchange and regulatory
agency fees. Options on futures are charged at a rate of $4.50/side.
Currently, I am clearing a portion of the Financials, Stock indices and
Agricultural futures for Enron. Financing rates have not been applicable to
your account with us to date, due to the fact that we are marked to market
daily. If excess margin balances were to occur in the future, we would pay
you a negotiated rate similar to the average 30 day bill rate (because
monies are wired back and forth daily this rarely happens, credit or debit).
  I do understand the need for financing(e.g.. Energy trading
business) and would like to  have the opportunity to bid on clearing and
financing Enrons energy futures trades, as well as utilizing the financing
capabilities that Citibank can provide.
 If you feel that I can further assist in any of these areas, please
call me and I'll come down to Houston to discuss the specific needs of
Enron.

 Thanks for your time and the effort to get our present documents
executed. Sheila, could you please include your phone number in case I need
to contact you? Thanks again.

Sincerely,

 Brian J. Gallagher

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.

1. Ms. Lewis' information does not appear to be in the lotus notes entry for 
ECI-Bear that I have used for the past two weeks.  Re: lotus notes, however, 
I certainly could be wrong. If you are certain, please point out or forward.

2.  You indicated in our meeting in my office that someone represented that 
Bear does not need the standard accompanying documents to open the account.  
As per my email request yesterday evening, can you confirm who determined 
this (if it was not you) so that I know what is going on and what I can 
represent in talking with the people at Bear?

the following information/clarification in light of your conversations with 
other folks:

1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents 
with the agreements to get things moving?

2.  If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get 
this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has 
advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like 
Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project.

3. Re: this attorney Cheryl at Bear  that you have talked to -- what is her 
full name, phone, and fax?

Sara, I am well aware of these emails. 

You are correct this has been going on for some time but I hope that you do 
not mean to suggest that the lack of resolution is due to any negligence on 
my part. 

As I already explained to you at our meeting today that (1) the information 
that Richard Sage provided to us was not accurate; (2) and (2) has been 
constantly changing BOTH within the database and from Richard's perspective.  
Moreover, I figured out that it did not make sense to have officers from both 
the U.S. and London.

Richard Sage has asked us to change the slate of directors and officers of

retain an officer title.   Will you please provide to me a list of who the 
directors will be and who the officers will be and their respective titles.  
My understanding is that these elections should take place effective March 5,

So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of

I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in

Hi Sara,

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

Hi Sara, I wanted to let you know that I made calls re: these files we 
previosly discussed:

Cross Timbers & Ocean Energy- Jay will call me next week when Fred gets back 
from out of town.

Quebicor - left messages for Ken.

Russell Metals - Carol will get back to me.

Camden -- figuring it out with Aparna.

* I did not call any one on Clorox because I noted that I should call a 
"Gerald Sypro" and could not find such a person in people finder -- but will 
figure this out.  

Montana Power -- I will call Tanya today or Tuesday.

I send the request, dated 6/2/00, to Morgan Stanley to Contribute the shares 
from EPCA to EDIDE and then Convert EDIDE's shares to ordinary WHEN the 
account for EDIDE is open.  Kelly has forwarded a copy to you.  

My understanding from Susan is that they are awaiting registration materials 
from you.  Please let me know when Legal can expect to receive these.

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Stephanie, 

I have asked a couple of times but still have not heard back from you about 
what happened to the Goldman Sachs completed agreements I gave you on 
Thursday 10th to get signatures and send to Goldman.  When Tom and I spoke 
this morning he expressed angst that Goldman did not have the Agreement yet.  
Can you tell me today where those documents are and whether or not they went 
out to Goldman?

and sent a signed copy of the Service Agreement to me this afternoon.  Thus, 
the Agreement is ready for Sheila's signature for execution.  I am sending

Hi Mark, 

To follow-up, I have been SUPER super-swamped.  

Do you have a time table for getting the lawyer you want to hire to replace 
me for the Enron Corp. matters?

Hey Stephanie, we need to revise this list because it does not make sense at 
least with respect to ENA.  It does not list key people (e.g. Gary) and it is 
inconsistent with the resolutions.  For example, the resolutions say that a 
managing director and treasurer can be a designated person to open an account 
but ENA does not have such an officer.  There are MD's and then there is a VP 
and Treasurer.  There are I think other inconsistencies we need to clear up 
to avoid having the accounts invalidated.  Having these points clear is 
especially important where, like now, we won't have Gary or Mark Frevert sign 
because they are out of town and we need to open the account right away.  

I know you are swamped so I will work tonight on revising the List for ENA 
tonight and give the revisions to do first thing in the morning.

Can you revise the List for ECT today (or just doublecheck it) so that we do 
not have a hold up in executing the Goldman International account for ECT 
first thing in the morning.  I promised Sheila Glover we would execute it 
right away.

Did we open any ENA accounts in the past two weeks and if so, just to be 
clear, can we send them a list that includes Gary's name and title if he 
signed.

Hi Theresa, 

Here is our daily update since we are trying to move quickly on this:

I had a conference call with Sara Stowey in London.  We actually had two 
legal issues outstanding as of yesterday.  One she agreed to.  The last one 
has to do with arbitration and she says that hopefully she will have an aswer 
by Friday.  If not, then on Friday, I could seek approval from our General 
Counsel to deviate from our standard legal policy on the issue so that we 
could move forward.

We have a borkerage account meeting today and I will forward to you a written 
status report at that time.  As I mentioned to Aneela this morning, most of 
the agreements on her list have been executed.

Keegan, can you make a copy of a portion of this file for me for each of the abovementioned colleagues?

Marie, in response to your note about Morgan-ECI, as per my earlier email to you and Stephanie, I generally do not keep copies of brokerage agreements we send out or receive back, Stephanie does.  With few exceptions, I give all brokerage related documents to Stephanie to send out and to receive back. So please check with the file cabinet behind Stephanie for other copies.

You may want to clarify this with Keegan as 1) your voice mail was full on 
that Friday, 2) Keegan tried to contact you in New York and the number she 
had for you was disconnected, and 3) we tried to locate the documents that 
Friday and were not able to.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you 
the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into 
my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave 
it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able 
to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask 
Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she 
always knows how to reach me.

For future reference, if anyone is looking for a file for an urgent matter 
while I am out, she should convey that fact to me by either (1) leaving a 
voice mail - as I checked my voicemails on Friday (that is how I was able to 
speak with Tom from New York on Friday) or (2) advise Keegan and she will 
contact me immediately by cell phone as she did regarding other matters on

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution 
as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as 
the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a 
message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. 
("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the 
following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the

Did we resolve this?  Its both.  The one marked account number 70900497 is 
ECT.  We should also have one marked acct number 70901071 for ENA.  Let me 
know where we stand and whether we need for me to call them back.

Which entity is this agreement for?  It does not indicate on the agreement.

Thanks

Hi Stephanie, 

I thought the execution process was complete on this one but actually we are 
still in the process of executing.  DBAB has sent to us two copies signed by 
them and hence, ready for our signatures.  I am forwarding to you so that you 
could get the signatures and prepare the Authorized Officers List and the 
Consent Form for signatures as well.  

Cassandra wants an explanatory blurb about why the account is necessary, 
please check in to get some justification from Aneela, Sheila or Theresa.

Thank you,
