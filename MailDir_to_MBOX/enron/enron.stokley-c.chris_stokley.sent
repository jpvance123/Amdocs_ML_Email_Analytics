Paige,

	I apologize for missing the 11:00 meeting, I will swing by and get an update latter this afternoon. Also, I am in a meeting on Project Ranger at 12:00. I hope to have a lot more clarity on what needs this will meet and the time period we can expect rollout of the different stages.

Actually, I think the settlements group would have to have this number at an aggregate level to be able to potion FERC.

I would have to go into each spreadsheet and make that calculation.  An
example would be for Jan. 1, the total charges were $2,053,504.

I confirmed that since Enron does not deviate from their schedules in
real
time a good portion of the payments have been going to Enron.  It is
still
up in the air what they will do with these charges.

Ann confirmed that Hertzberg had called Lynch asking for them to delay.
And, of course the PUC accommodated them today.  Ann said however, that she
was not able to hold the decision until July 12.  The reason is that a
letter from the Treasurer, DWR and Finance was sent to Commissioners and
legislators telling them that DA had to be suspended by June 28 in order fo=
r
appeals etc. to be settled by the time the issue the bonds in August.  I
believe someone else referenced this letter in an e-mail yesterday.  Ann is
appending the letter to the Bilas alternate so everyone can see it and
comment.  Also, they are going to ask for comments on going to "bottoms up"
rates.

Keoni,

	I realize that there are no penalty charges associated to Load, I am referring to the neg. and positive load deviation. What are all of the charges associated to the penalties for deviation from schedule. 

	Ps  Jim, take your best cut at what you think these charges are and then get Keoni too sign off on what results you come up with. We need to put every charge that we think is linked to a schedule and then just have Keoni fill in the gaps and sign off on the document.

There are no "penalty charges" associated with loads, just the load
deviation charges such as replacement reserves.

Amy,

Subject:=09RE: California Energy Resources Scheduling - February payment=20

Chris,

The issue here is whether the CalPX or California Energy Resources Schedule=
r ("CERS") owes us $186,000 for the power we delivered to the CalPX from Fe=
bruary 1st through 6 under our block forward contracts.=09=09=09=09=09=09

The State of California, i.e., CERS, is responsible for payment of this pow=
er.  It is true that we scheduled the block forwards through the Cal PX on =
Feb. 1-6, and that we did not schedule this power through CERS until Februa=
ry 6 (delivery on the 7th).  But Governor Davis issued Emergency Orders D-2=
0-01 and D-21-01 on January 31st.  Under these Orders, the So. Cal. Edison =
and PG&E block forward contracts were "hereby commandeered by the State of =
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State =
of California."  The Orders were effective "immediately."  Because the Orde=
rs was effective on January 31st, the State had title to the contracts from=
 January 31st forward.  Section 8572 of the California Emergency Services A=
ct authorizes the Governor to commandeer private property, but requires the=
 State to pay the "reasonable value thereof."  Therefore, since the State o=
f California had legal title to the contracts and the power supplied under =
those contracts on February 1st, the State of California---through CERS---i=
s responsible for paying for power delivered on February 1st, and forward. =
=20

Responsibility for payment falls on the party with title to the power, not =
the party responsible for scheduling the power.  Just because the CalPX con=
tinued to schedule power for a few days while CERS got its act together doe=
s not mean that the PX was responsible for payment.  Once California took t=
itle to the power,---and all the benefits of having the power---it also ass=
umed responsibility for payment.=20

I would be happy to explain this to CERS, if you want.  Let me know.

Hi Chris,=09
=09
=09I wanted to check on California Energy Resouces Scheduling - the piece t=
hey disputed paying us in February.  Virginia had in DMS that you are handl=
ing this now. So, to refresh your memory, they did not pay us $186,000 in F=
ebruary - broken down as follows:

Deal #533136.1  2/1/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/2/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/3/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/5/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/6/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So t=
hey are saying these weren't theirs until the 7th.

Thus my accounts receiveable shows that we have been shorted $186,000.  I n=
eed to know if I can collect this from them or if we will change the deals =
so that they will not be charged for the above days they are disputing.  I =
really need to get this fixed as soon as possible - since this shows possib=
le exposure to us if we can't collect or DPR to the West if we have to remo=
ve these deals for the above days.

Let me know if you have any questions and let me know what info. you have.

Thanks!
Amy

Importance:	High

Can you run this down for Chris, and copy me on it.  If they haven't completed it, I'd like to why and when it will be done.

Chris,  I apologize for this sitting here since Wednesday with no response.  I was in CSC's offices on Wednesday and Thursday.  I need to get a lap top to check in when I travel.

Brenda,
	I need to give Jeff Ricter an update on where this item stands with CSC. I am still going off of the e-mail listed below stating that CSC could meet this deliverable by sometime this week. This is the item that we talked about in last week's Project Ranger meeting, and agreed needed to put on the high priority list. If you have any questions on this item, please feel free to call me at 503-807-8959. Thank for your help on this item.

Subject:	RE: FW: CSC UPDATE

Chris,

In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  

Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  

I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. 

The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Maurice

What's up Chris?  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I don't know how things are going to pan out with the re-org, but I think the re-org is being done out of necessity.  I don't know who Don Black is.  I know that when he came in, Dennis Benevides reported to him.  He moved Dennis off of the Power Desk and put Neil Bresnan in charge.  Obviously, his role has expanded.  Will your group be reporting to him now?

Rick Baltz was our Director when Derenda and I left.  He has since moved over to work for Evan Hughes.  Mary Lynn Ruffer is now over the group.  George Phillips is managing the settlements/volume control function.  At least this is my understanding. 

I think Derenda will be a much happier person wherever she is going.  It's too bad that she had to get a raw deal in order for her to find happiness, but that's the way the world works sometimes.

So what all are you going to be doing over the next 6 months?  Is it strictly related to volume management?  Is it only related to the West?  Maybe we can grab some lunch when you come to Houston.  Talk to you later.

Wayne,
	What do think of the latest re-org and the e-mail we got from Derenda. Do you have any insight into what is going on over in the EES world. It looks like I will be on the team that helps sort all of this out and I wanted to see if you had any knowledge on Don Black. Also, who is the gentleman that caused you and Derenda so much grief? I guess this all worked out well for you in the end, since you won't have to sweat all of the decisions that are about to take place for that area of the business. I more than likely will be in Houston quite a bit over the next 6mts, so I will swing by and visit with you and Chad when I find out my schedule. Hope all is going well, Derenda told me that you were enjoying your job.

Sean,
	Did you get a chance to talk to Evan about the issue concerning the lack of notification as to when PG&E transferred over certain meters to EES.

Mary Lynne - I spoke with Pam/Chris S./Mike F.about this issue.  Since Chris is  charged with improving the general settlement process including this specific inssue, he has asked me to be available to answer all his questions and defer all questions I receive to him.  He stated that he understood the urgency and attention this issue commands and will respond accordingly.

George - Do you know anything about this problem?  I would assume you would have seen large discrepancies b/w meter and scheduled.  Would appreciate a response asap as this has a great deal of attention!

Wanda and Jeff, 
Attached is the file we discussed putting together for your. 
Energy Schedules vs. Energy Usage (Meter Data) 
By looking at the information, it appears that the PGES book of business is the biggest problem. 
EES has constantly under scheduled the PGES book of business in the PGE3 load zone.  I'm nut sure if it is related to under scheduling or reporting incorrect meter data to the ISO. 
We discussed that starting on 2/1/01 the combined schedules for EES/PGES should have changed to 50mwh per hour (Both books of business included in this number). On averages.
Based on what I am seeing this is not the case. 
I have copied Michael Frazier on this message so he can take a look at the schedule information we received.  I have also included Jim Reyes in the Portland Volume Management group so he can look into the Meter vs. Schedule issues in April and May.  EES was scheduling volumes but never identified / reported usage (Meter data).  At the same time they were drastically under scheduling on PGE3
If anyone has questions please feel free to give me a call @ 503-702-9846 
<<EES_PGES Load Data 1200 - 0601_101601.xls>> 
Thanks - MO

Chris,

I left a message on you answering machine last Thursday at 4:36 p.m. (PST)
regarding higher loads noticed in PGE territory. I'm sending this email n
case you're out for a period of time.

I basically just noticed that load had risen above observed normal levels in
July for EPMISCE1, EPMIPGE1, EPMIPGE2, and EPMIPGE3. I was wondering if you
knew why this was happening? On my phone message I also indicted that I had
seen schedules going up as well and assumed that you may be picking up new
customers.

Thank you,

Subject:	FW: Status of Actualizations - October Deviation Preliminaries and Finals, and 'Other' Finals


I spent several hours with TJ shadowing and we tested the 402 code while I examined results.  As each error or incorrect result was noted, we went to the code and walked through and made changes.  TJ is now running actual dates and we will check them in the morning.  When all is well, we will run the rest of October.  Next we will perform the same testing and coding revisions for 405 (only need to test for EPMI-side exceptions) and then we will be able to run 405 for the month.

After the latest unsuccessful run of 403, I delved into the specific details of the variances, and all of the material volumes are included in the Finals, so any allocations that would be created as a result of those variances would be reversed when I run the Final actualization.  So, this morning I manually calculated appropriate allocations for our Load customers (the variances are due to re-submitted meter data), entered the values in the ProRata allocation table, created an additional allocation for the remaining 1.9496MW variance, matched all up to the ISO, and completed 403 for Preliminaries.

I have actualized the regular stuff and set to M through October 27.  I will wrap those up on Friday.

At this point in time we are on target for completion of Prelims by Friday afternoon, but Finals may not be done until Monday.

Subject:	FW: Status of Actualizations - October Deviation Preliminaries and Finals, and 'Other' Finals

Anna and I worked through the coding for 403 and she made some changes to the method for finding percent usage.  I reran the tool and looked at the results and we still do not have valid allocations.  On October 1, we now have an 877MW difference between the variance and the amount allocated.  Will look into it again tomorrow.

402 is nearly complete.  Ran into an error while running a test day, and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow.  405 should be a quick fix once we get the 402 exceptions working properly.

I have actualized finals on the regular charges through October 23, and should be able to wrap up most, if not all, of the rest tomorrow.

If we can get them working properly tomorrow, then I will be able to finish the Prelims on Friday, and the Finals on Monday.

Exception handling coding changes are nearly complete.  TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

For the regular actualizations, I have set 10/1 - 10/18 (except 10/16) to M today.  There is a strange anomaly going on on the 16th, and neither Donna nor I could figure out what.  I will get back to it.

Anticipate completion of all by Monday, May 7.

Caroline

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

Subject:	Status of Deviation Actualizations - October Preliminaries

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

Hey Chris,

Here's the list of meters requiring installation but for which we have no data. So I'm not able to calculate the financial exposure. Let me know if you are able to obtain it. Sorry for the delay. Thanks for your help.

Linda,
	This is not what we agreed upon when we had our conference call. You where supposed to come back to me with your plan on how to attack this audit within a week of our conference call.  Why did you not convey this change in status to Murray or myself? And who gave you the direction to put everything on hold until Murray and Kevin spoke? Murray knows nothing about this conversation that is supposed to take place with Kevin Hughes. Let me make this as clear as possible, EPMI is the one that is driving this process and you where given your direction by me to proceed forward on this audit. I expect to see a plan in my hands by the end of this week. All communication going forward are to go through me, and I will make the decision as to who needs to be in to the process.

          Thanks for your reply.  I received the ISO requirements
and timeline; the
          requirements appear to be materially consistent with
prior year.  We can set up
          a call to discuss the audit as early as next week, as we
are in the midst of our
          earnings release testing this week.  Would next Thursday
morning around 9:00
          a.m. (your time) work? Any other time on Thursday would
work with our schedules.

          Thanks,
          Linda

Amy, 
	I can not believe you did this without my approval! I hate to hear that you are leaving us, you have been such an asset to the Portland office. The person coming in just needs to start the car and drive, since you already built it. We need to go have a drink before you head off to oblivion. Where will you be working?

We regret to announce that Amy Fitzpatrick will be leaving Enron's Portland office in September.  Amy's husband, Simon, has accepted a job in New Jersey, and it didn't make sense for them to "commute" coast to coast.  Amy will continue to work here for the next month or two to hire her replacement and to make sure that her responsibilities have been completely handed over.  We really appreciate having such long lead time to effectuate this transition.

Amy has made tremendous contributions to our office over the last 14 months.  We really appreciate her efforts.  We realize that Amy has become integral to the efficient operation of the Portland office and want to make her transition as smooth as possible.  If you have any concerns or wish to get any issues on to the "transition list" please let your manager and/or Amy know.

Ann confirmed that Hertzberg had called Lynch asking for them to delay.
And, of course the PUC accommodated them today.  Ann said however, that she
was not able to hold the decision until July 12.  The reason is that a
letter from the Treasurer, DWR and Finance was sent to Commissioners and
legislators telling them that DA had to be suspended by June 28 in order fo=
r
appeals etc. to be settled by the time the issue the bonds in August.  I
believe someone else referenced this letter in an e-mail yesterday.  Ann is
appending the letter to the Bilas alternate so everyone can see it and
comment.  Also, they are going to ask for comments on going to "bottoms up"
rates.

Who has the scoop on the ski trip? Spending a lot of time in Houston working on the EES project, what a  mess. As far as the TX market, I am not currently involved in that area but will probably start looking at in within the next month. What is a QSE? So what are you currently working on for Reliant, and how do you like the work and culture so far. We need to go have lunch since I am in Houston damn near every week. Great to hear from you, and I hope that everything is going well for you.

I'm just now hearing some juicy stuff from your annual ski trip from 2000.
I said I would have paid to see IT.

How's it going?  Are you guys involved in the Texas market?  Are you a QSE?

call me at work some time.   713-207-3275

Diann,
	You should have notified me that you had passed this off to Maurice and not acted on it since we talked last Wed. From here on out I will assume that Maurice is the key person to get these issues resolved. Based on the e-mail below, I lost one week by your not having this conversation w/ a CSC rep last week. This is a week that we could not afford to lose. 

Maurice,
	Let me know what we need on our side to get the MDMA process escalated to a high priority item. Also, what is the estimated time of delivery from CSC once we make this a priority?  I agree w/ you best scenario recommendation, I would just like to be able to compare delivery dates b/w the two process that you have laid out. Thanks for your help on these items.

			Ps. When next week can we expect CSC to deliver these accounts to the FTP server? Also, what time the next day can we pull the files off 
			      Of the server?

									Chris

Chris,

In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  

Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  

I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. 

The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Maurice

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

Hey Chris,

I hope all is continuing to go as well as can be expected in H-town.

I'm writing with a worry and am not sure the best way to approach it.  The =
gist of it is that I am worried about the VM group and their reputation on =
the floor.  I'll give you a couple of examples as to why:  1) Chris Mallory=
 came to me and starting asking me questions about charges that go w/ impor=
ts and exports--I briefly answered but told him to talk to VM.  He said he =
didn't really know who to talk to, who would be able to answer his question=
s w/out Heather, you or myself back there.  (and he also did not know Jim R=
eyes' name until he asked me yesterday), 2) Bill came over the Darren today=
, concerned that he had been charged cong incorrectly b/c when Bill had che=
cked CAISO, the cong prices were all $0.  Not a huge deal that this happene=
d, but Jim needs to be signing off on the Flash ( i don't know if he is or =
not) and cong charges should always be closely monitored; and I don't think=
 that this is the first day that Bill has been incorrectly charged cong 3) =
Richter asked me who would be the person in VM that should help Tim Coffing=
 (his new analyst that moved up here) to deal w/ looking at the EES wholesa=
le settlements.  Jeff didn't know who would be the best b/c he doesn't real=
ly know the VM team anymore.  (I suggested Kit b/c he seems to be good at d=
igging into problems and getting answers).

Essentially, I think that the traders do not know all of the new faces, wha=
t they are doing and who they should be talking to.  You were always very c=
oncerned about the visibility/availability of the VM team as well as the cr=
edibility and I think these are suffering right now.  And of course on top =
of all of this is VMS.

Do you think I should send this to Scotty? Murray?  Without any management =
being here, I think it is tough to keep a heartbeat on the feeling of the t=
raders and I think that is part of the problem.  And I assume things will i=
mprove w/ Scotty here, but he needs to build relationships on the floor as =
well. =20

I am not trying to be critical of anyone or step on any toes, but I am conc=
erned. =20

Please let me know what you think...thanks and sorry to add a little more t=

?	Provided guidance to Virginia on what type of reports would be needed for the Traders along w/ settling up a weekly forum by which she can communicate her issues and results to the traders.
?	Helped coordinate a plan of attack on how we would become current on ISO actualizations and on what we would do in the interim.
?	Provide leadership,guicance and a shoulder for the group to cry on during a very stressful six months.
?	Worked Murray O'neil to provide different reporting units with timely accurate reporting of EPMI's credit position w/ the ISO and PX.
?	Provided solutions that helped manage Mid-Marketing expectations with what the group could provide in a timely manner due to our technology constraints.

Stewart,
	How amazing that this is exactly what we agreed to this morning. You then apparently decided to put yourself back into the process and schedule a meeting that I did not agree to attend. I made it very clear that it would be difficult for me to attend a meeting today, but that I could try to break free for 2:30. I then thought that it would be on ME not yourself to schedule this meeting if I was able to break lose from my meeting by 2:30.I left my schedule open most of last week in order to resolve this issue. However, we never got a response from Steve to allow us to close this item. Before any phone call takes place to Steve tomorrow, you and I will talk about the handling of this item going forward. Please stop by at your earliest convenience so that we can put this issue to rest.

Steve,
	I don't see the attachment. As far as the percentage of Calf. contracts that have  band consumption, my assumption is that it is quite high. I base this on our discussion w/ Dennis and my talks w/ Neil Bresnen. My understanding is that all contracts that where written after first quarter of 1999, have some type of  band consumption language in them.  I spoke w/ Joshua yesterday and I feel that we are making the progress that I would expect at this point. I would like to meet w/ you when I get back in Houston on Monday if you have the time. Also, Joshua is supposed to send me an update today so that I can better assess as to where we are at on the consumption band initiative.

			PS. Sorry I am late getting back w/ you, I could get into my e-mail yesterday but could not send out any e-mail. I still owe you the Project Phoenix   			       list. Also, do we still need to meet w/ Kristian and Murray?

Take a look at this document. The section with major players is the one with the utilities that are tied to an index, however, there are some minor utilities that are not covered in that list. Do you think that we need the minor utilities?

Subject:=09RE: California Energy Resources Scheduling - February payment=20

Chris,

The issue here is whether the CalPX or California Energy Resources Schedule=
r ("CERS") owes us $186,000 for the power we delivered to the CalPX from Fe=
bruary 1st through 6 under our block forward contracts.=09=09=09=09=09=09

The State of California, i.e., CERS, is responsible for payment of this pow=
er.  It is true that we scheduled the block forwards through the Cal PX on =
Feb. 1-6, and that we did not schedule this power through CERS until Februa=
ry 6 (delivery on the 7th).  But Governor Davis issued Emergency Orders D-2=
0-01 and D-21-01 on January 31st.  Under these Orders, the So. Cal. Edison =
and PG&E block forward contracts were "hereby commandeered by the State of =
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State =
of California."  The Orders were effective "immediately."  Because the Orde=
rs was effective on January 31st, the State had title to the contracts from=
 January 31st forward.  Section 8572 of the California Emergency Services A=
ct authorizes the Governor to commandeer private property, but requires the=
 State to pay the "reasonable value thereof."  Therefore, since the State o=
f California had legal title to the contracts and the power supplied under =
those contracts on February 1st, the State of California---through CERS---i=
s responsible for paying for power delivered on February 1st, and forward. =
=20

Responsibility for payment falls on the party with title to the power, not =
the party responsible for scheduling the power.  Just because the CalPX con=
tinued to schedule power for a few days while CERS got its act together doe=
s not mean that the PX was responsible for payment.  Once California took t=
itle to the power,---and all the benefits of having the power---it also ass=
umed responsibility for payment.=20

I would be happy to explain this to CERS, if you want.  Let me know.

Hi Chris,=09
=09
=09I wanted to check on California Energy Resouces Scheduling - the piece t=
hey disputed paying us in February.  Virginia had in DMS that you are handl=
ing this now. So, to refresh your memory, they did not pay us $186,000 in F=
ebruary - broken down as follows:

Deal #533136.1  2/1/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/2/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/3/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/5/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/6/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So t=
hey are saying these weren't theirs until the 7th.

Thus my accounts receiveable shows that we have been shorted $186,000.  I n=
eed to know if I can collect this from them or if we will change the deals =
so that they will not be charged for the above days they are disputing.  I =
really need to get this fixed as soon as possible - since this shows possib=
le exposure to us if we can't collect or DPR to the West if we have to remo=
ve these deals for the above days.

Let me know if you have any questions and let me know what info. you have.

Thanks!
Amy

	Hey Bud,

		Just checking in to see how Austin and Ercot are treating you. Do you like your gig, house, work culture etc. I tried to call you but it won't let me through, do you have a new work number. Flying into Houston every week is getting quite old, but is has to be done.

Yes, we do have Outlook. Get w/ Monica, I currently have her on my MSN IM. How is that Spanish coming along, can I now bring you along as an interpreter on my next trip to South America? Also, you need to come up w/ an excuse for  coming over to Houston in the very near future.

Chris,

Enron Europe has restricted access to MSN Messenger to communicate through the web. It is possible to set it up if you have MS Outlook.  Have you guys been migrated to MS Outlook?  Anyway, how is everything?

Cheers

Chris,

A request was put in from Mike Tully to add exporting funtionality to the Scheduling Activity Report (SAR).  This functionality has been added and is now currently in Stage, ready for user testing.  I spoke with David Poston about who to contact for this, and he directed me to you.  If you have any questions please let me know, also please e-mail me back if the report is fine so I can put the request in to move it to production.

The Stage Version # is:  2.0.0.19
 
Thanks,

Brett Pate

Subject:	RE: SAR Report

Hey, good morning Will. I was out yesterday, so I could not get in touch with you. Sorry. Anyway, the problem is that the SAR report has no way to save the data to anything other than it's own special format. We need the ability to save this data into a CSV type file. The reason for this is that we sometimes send this report to customers and, presently, they cannot view the information. We also share this report with our traders who need immediate access to this report and cannot view it unless they take the time to Open up Enpower and then view the report through there. This presents a problem as most of the time Enpower is so slow. Is there any way that we can have an option to save the data to either a CSV Type, or as an Excel Document.

Thanks

Mike

	I have heard nothing on my end about the status of the update meeting. I will update you the moment I hear something. I have not spoken to Paige as of this morning. I will track her down and reschedule this meeting and give you an update on the new time.

With the expansion to the 4th floor, we have been allotted some additional parking spots in the World Trade Center building.  Currently, we have 6 spots available.  Based on the waiting list that was distributed on March 19, 2001, the following individuals have first option on these spots.

Karen Jones 
Caroline Emmert 
Sean Crandall 
Murray O'Neil 
Kathy Axford 
Jim Gilbert 

The cost of these spots are: 

Regular Parking         $155/month 
Reserved Parking        $185/month 

If you are listed above and are interested in parking in the WTC, please see me for a parking agreement form. 

Just a few things to keep in mind..... 

1.  Your spot is not transferable to another employee.  If you choose not to take the spot at this time, your name will remain on the waiting list.

2.  Payment for these spots can be done through direct payroll deduction or you can choose to make payments monthly and submit for expense reimbursement (total company cost covered is $84/month).

3.  A deposit of $20 is required for your parking badge.  Please make this check payable to PMC and return with your parking agreement.

Below is the waiting list and the order in which other individuals will become eligible as additional parking spots become available.

1.  Chris Stokley 
2.  John Malowney 
3.  Phil Platter 
4.  Diana Scholtes 
5.  Julie Sarnowski 
6.  Lysa Tracy

Geiv,
	Just curious, who do you think has time to go over the mistakes that you may have made in these spreadsheets? For the time being, Pam will take care of this process for you. In return, you will be given a 24hr timeline to get all discrepancies answered and cleaned up in Deal Tracker. I feel this is a fair timeline since Pam is the person doing the leg work to identify all discrepancies. If you have any questions or suggestion on this process, feel free to call me at 56120.

Hi Chris.
 
Brett said that he has had trouble sending you e-mail to this address since we have arrived in Austin.  I just wanted to see if you could return this same message to me if this address is correct.  Don't worry about writing a reply.  
 
He sent you another message last week and I just wanted to make sure you received.  I know Brett isn't looking for a reply anytime soon considering how busy you and he both are.  
 
Take care and tell Rachel I said hello.

Elizabeth,
	Any luck on fixing this problem?

Subject:	Meeting you would be interested in

I am forwarding emails relevant to the Team Ranger initiative from the time I became involved to the time the scope of the effort was limited.  My understanding from my notes and recollections and a discussion with Glen Matthys this morning is as follows:
*  Team Ranger is co-sponsored by Greg Young, Scott Mills, and Mary Lynn Ruffer.
*  Team Ranger's objective is to capture all the data necessary for Ruffer to provide flash reports to Mills on what should liquidated from the risk book  vs actual costs and revenues experienced; Young's involved because his Operations group provides the link to CSC's billing and invoicing systems.
*  Since I had been discussing my forecasting data needs and RPS tie-ins with Scott, he viewed this as an opportunity for the organization to gather more information than strictly needed to meet this objective and invited me to lobby for an expanded scope.
*  Clearly I was outvoted, since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to CSC and which will enable flash report development quickly (for power only); an expanded scope would have compromised timely deliverables.
*  The system will pull down monthly data from STAT and LodeStar billing systems on a daily frequency (and will still provide some valuable information for me).
*  The data collected for Team Ranger will be housed in an Enron-controlled database (not CSC's), supposedly for easy access to Enron users.


Chris, this clearly falls in the realm we were discussing last night -- a limited scope "silo" initiative to solve a localized problem.  Like I said, I'm a culprit, too -- if no one else wants to provide the data I need, I'll pull it myself just as you counseled a month ago when we were struggling to get answers from CSC (via Operations). I admit you were right: we've gotten more data since then with access privileges than I could have wrangled out of requests to CSC in six months (despite California).

Let me know what else you need from me to facilitate your efforts.  Please keep me updated with what you learn and where we stand.  I'll do the same.

There is a meeting scheduled for Monday (see below) to discuss information that must be provided by CSC and Avista so that we can start tying out what is actually billed to what is in the Risk books.  This is a lot of the same information that I know you are trying to get your hands around.  If you are interested in attending, please do so.  If you are not available, give me some data points so that nothing is overlooked.  This will be the first of many "get togethers".  Evan Hughes and his group will be there to represent what we are currently getting from the outsource providers as well as what we are collecting internally.

Subject:	Re: A/R Accruals Mtg. - Reminder   

After looking at this, a couple of thoughts:

Assuming that we will create a "global" repository that will support everyone's needs for all EES activity (purchases and sells)

	Internal as well as outsource data

Outsource data needs to be "Enronized" (consistent internal formatting of field values)

	We should be able to use the GCP/EES Settlement System cross reference mapping that is set up and maintained by Global Counterparty as a way to get 	to Enron's Global Counterparty number

This should be a daily feed

We will need the same information for payments

Additional information needed in the file:

EES Entity transacting Business
Commodity 			(e.g. power, gas)
Covered Service		(e.g. commodity, projects, AOPS)
Flow Begin Date
Flow End Date
Volume
Volume Frequency 		(e.g. daily, monthly, total for period)
Volume Status			(e.g. estimated, actual)
Price Type 			(e.g. Commodity, Tax, ...)
Rate Schedule 			(if applicable -e.g. Name of Utility Rate Class)
Rate Name 			(if applicable -e.g. IF-Transco/Z6 New York Restricted)
Pass Through Fee 		(Yes/No)
Price (Per Unit)/Rate  		(e.g. Per Unit $50.00 USD/MWH or Rate $100,000 USD)
Price Currency                                   (e.g. USD, CAD, etc.
Total Amount 			(Price * Volume)
Total Amount Currency		(e.g. USD, CAD, etc.

Joni -how different is the information in this file compared to what Mike Newlin is getting on a daily basis for the Credit Aggregation process.  Should what Mike is getting be coordinated with this process.  The one advantage that I can see now is the ability to get an aged open A/R Balance

Mary Lynne -is there any additional information from what you are having pulled now for reconciliation of prior months?

Michael -from your requirements that you are already discussing regarding volumes, is there anything else?

How different is this from the Tax Project extract that was discussed -can these efforts be consolidated?

I will have Christina schedule a meeting for further discussion.

As discussed in the subject meeting, Joni and I have been working with Patrick Cagney and CSC on defining a project to generate a daily extract file containing transactional invoice data with accounts receivable balances and collections.  Attached is the data item list as discussed with CSC for your information.  CSC has already submitted an impact statement for this work; however, if it would assist any of your efforts to use, expand, or modify this data extract, I believe it would be beneficial to discuss it before we move forward with this project.  Please let Patrick or myself know if you have any questions regarding this.

Thanks,

First, I'm sorry about the tardiness.  Attached is the file you sent me with data elements that are important in volume forecasting highlighted and copied into its own column, then supplemented with additional information that would be useful if available from the sources contemplated.  Note the color codes used in highlighting are yellow to denote necessary or essential and blue to mark elements that "would be nice or occasionally useful."  Thanks, Pat, for your help in compiling this list.

Wayne,
	What do think of the latest re-org and the e-mail we got from Derenda. Do you have any insight into what is going on over in the EES world. It looks like I will be on the team that helps sort all of this out and I wanted to see if you had any knowledge on Don Black. Also, who is the gentleman that caused you and Derenda so much grief? I guess this all worked out well for you in the end, since you won't have to sweat all of the decisions that are about to take place for that area of the business. I more than likely will be in Houston quite a bit over the next 6mts, so I will swing by and visit with you and Chad when I find out my schedule. Hope all is going well, Derenda told me that you were enjoying your job.



							Chris

I just talked to the developer and the MV90 and MDMA data sinks up daily.  The previous day's
read should be available in MDMA the next day.  I haven't asked for a logon and password to get
into MV90 because I am not sure you would want the data from MV90.  From my understanding,
MV90 will hold the raw usage and it does not get validated for high low checks or other errors until it gets to MDMA.

If the previous day's data is sufficient then MDMA should be good enough.

Let me know if you still need me to pursue further.

Vivian,
	Have you heard anything back on the time in which they sink up MV90 and MDMA. Also, were you able to find out the password to get into MV90 just in case we have  to go straight to the source. Thanks again for all of your help on these issues.

Anna and I worked through the coding for 403 and she made some changes to the method for finding percent usage.  I reran the tool and looked at the results and we still do not have valid allocations.  On October 1, we now have an 877MW difference between the variance and the amount allocated.  Will look into it again tomorrow.

402 is nearly complete.  Ran into an error while running a test day, and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow.  405 should be a quick fix once we get the 402 exceptions working properly.

I have actualized finals on the regular charges through October 23, and should be able to wrap up most, if not all, of the rest tomorrow.

If we can get them working properly tomorrow, then I will be able to finish the Prelims on Friday, and the Finals on Monday.

Exception handling coding changes are nearly complete.  TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

For the regular actualizations, I have set 10/1 - 10/18 (except 10/16) to M today.  There is a strange anomaly going on on the 16th, and neither Donna nor I could figure out what.  I will get back to it.

Anticipate completion of all by Monday, May 7.

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

Chris, Michael--

I've been looking at some of the MV-90 files from CSC. Here's what I have found:

There are 1200 to 1400 meters reported each day. We will need to keep an eye on this number to see what kind of growth to expect.
Almost all meters report in 15 minute intervals. Interestingly enough, one meter (UCSF CUP 3), started reporting 5 minute intervals on 6 August, and has done so ever since.
The current prototype application I am using to read this data into a temporary database reads about 1meter per second, so I am averaging around 20 minutes per file. While I think I can improve the speed of this process, it does not take into account the need to map this data to the correlating account data, so any gains may be lost there.
Although some of the datafiles are complete (4 readings per hour X 24 hours X every meter) others are missing quite a lot of data. ("9 missing readings for meter KZ+029402367...87 missing readings for meter KZ+029402370...15 missing readings for meter KZ+029402392...") I will work with CSC next week to figure out what is causing this extreme variance in the dependability of the data from day to day.

Next week I will be looking into MDMA to match up these meter ids with accounts. I will let you know what I find.

John,

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

Subject:	CES2423 Project Proposal

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

--John

Guys -

Please review my amended requirements for the Baseline/Bandwidth project.  I
think the approach will be relatively simple, with a lot of data entry on
the side of our staff.  That notwithstanding, I think that our requirements
are pretty solid, with the exception of the code/calculations required for
actually establishing baselines/bands where they do not exist.  We will need
to establish processes and procedures for doing so; this for the staff
actually performing the contract-by-contract work.  We should discuss this
stuff again today.  thanks.

The Nov. payment is being calculated at 23 cents on a dollar (Due to the ISO short-pay) while the Dec. payment is dollar for dollar.  We will then actualize both Nov. and Dec before the close of the May accounting month. Please give me call if you have any questions on this topic.

Chris,

Thanks for your reply.  I received the ISO requirements and timeline; the
requirements appear to be materially consistent with prior year.  We can set up
a call to discuss the audit as early as next week, as we are in the midst of our
earnings release testing this week.  Would next Thursday morning around 9:00
a.m. (your time) work? Any other time on Thursday would work with our schedules.

Thanks,
Linda

I am trying to find out if the data from MV90 get interfaced into MDMA on a daily basis

MV90 will have raw data and will not have gone through validations which are performed
in MDMA.

Subject:	Load Forecasting access to MV90 interval data

All,

I spoke with Pat Priestley this morning about our request to get access to the MV90 daily interval meter data for load forecasting.  She said that she would not be available to meet formally until Monday due to the declared disaster at their operations due to the flood.  She said they are moving back to the Pennzoil building today and Friday, so things should be close to normal by Monday.

Pat said that it is not be a problem to export the MV90 data (in just about any format) on a daily basis for us.  The data is housed in MV90 databases which , according to Pat, can only be read by an MV90 system; so we would need to purchase MV90 (very expensive) if we wanted to read the data directly.  

I suggest we get the data exported daily from CSC to an FTP site at Enron, because they can manage the process on a daily basis.  We can sweep the FTP site daily and have it automatically imported into our databases.

If we are in agreement with this solution, I  will create an emergency work request with CSC to begin working on this immediately.


Maurice

Remember how bad T.A. reported that we all were on putting cuts into the system, enpower work,  reconciliation,  etc. ? 

THESE GUYS DO NONE OF THAT - NO ONE EVEN KNOWS HOW.   

Settlements is working hard,  but TA doesnt say a word to the RT traders here,  as it would be political suicide.     That's why she turned toward us.
She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO,   and I talked to her,   explaining my expectations.   She was squirming  about saying that she or Rebecca wouldnt know the answers.   Im cool with that,  but cant you find out?   Everything is such a big struggle here.

Im not coming until February at the earliest.    I am an Oregonian.
The freaking mosquitos are terrible now that the floodwaters have subsided.  I forgot about that bit of joy.

Later,
JMf

Bob,

Brenda wants us to move quickly with this request.  In your opinion, what is the best way to process this request?  If you put it under the 'Ranger' request, will this escalate this to the top?  If so, please do it.  It you have another process, let us now.  We do not want to incur additional charges by using an ECR, if we can avoid it.

What 'paperwork' needs to be completed?   WIP?  other?

Thanks

In an effort to centralize information uncovered in various meetings, I have put together a short document covering *my* understanding of the meter data flow. Please take a look at ...

     http://172.24.5.129:90/sp/doc/project/analysis/meterdataanalysis.html

...and reply with any corrections, additions and feedback--I will incorporate them into the document.


Pat Priest has told us that if we could get a WIP in by today regarding the daily download of meter data from MV-90, CSC might be able to turn something around to us by next week. Who is in charge of this process? Who gives the go-ahead?

--John

I would like to discuss the EPMI/SCL split on the differences  detailed in Caroline's spreadsheet.  It appeared that the differences were  the gross amounts owed by the CISO for our business, without being segregated  into a recomputed EPMI portion and SCL portion.  I would like to clarify  the magnitude and certainty of the difference between our Prelim and expected  Final payments at this point in time.  Given the magnitude, I think we  should then discuss the timing of payments, so it might be a good idea if Stuart  were on the call as well.  My calendar is open from 1 to 2 if you want to  work it in then.

     I will  be in meeting most of the morning but have an open schedule
after 12:30  today. Would 1:00 be a good time for us to discuss any pending

Kristian,

	I apologize for  not doing a better job of staying in touch the past few months. I have been flying into Houston every week for the past two months, which is getting quite old. I am not sure what will come of this project, but so far I am still dealing w/ Settlement issues. I hear that things are going a lot better for you since we last spoke, promotion, your own book, etc. Monica seems to also be doing quite well in her new role in origination. She did have time to give me shit for not doing a better job of staying in touch. I told her to go slap you in the head and make you install Instant Messenger on your Computer, so please do so. It is about the only way that I get a chance to communicate  w/ anyone these days including my family.

Remember how bad T.A. reported that we all were on putting cuts into the system, enpower work,  reconciliation,  etc. ? 

THESE GUYS DO NONE OF THAT - NO ONE EVEN KNOWS HOW.   

Settlements is working hard,  but TA doesnt say a word to the RT traders here,  as it would be political suicide.     That's why she turned toward us.
She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO,   and I talked to her,   explaining my expectations.   She was squirming  about saying that she or Rebecca wouldnt know the answers.   Im cool with that,  but cant you find out?   Everything is such a big struggle here.

Im not coming until February at the earliest.    I am an Oregonian.
The freaking mosquitos are terrible now that the floodwaters have subsided.  I forgot about that bit of joy.

Later,

Subject:	RE: FW: CSC UPDATE

Chris,

In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  

Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  

I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. 

The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Maurice

Diann,

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

Vivian has regained access to the MDMA.    However, I need to control who has access so that we don't interfere with CSC's operation.  Let me know who will need access to this data.  Thanks.

Bob,
	I am a little confused, my understanding was that you would be able to escalate these items to get a quick turnaround time in comparison to going the normal process. What you are recommending sounds like the normal process, am I incorrect on that conclusion?  When can I expect to get feedback from CSC with the process listed below?

John/Chris - I spoke to Steve Walker with Team Enron this morning about your request.  He'll be contacting you to help fill out the request form and get it submitted.  When the request is completed, it should be forwarded to Jacqueline Jackson in my group for submission to CSC.  With respect to your time for completion requirements, we'll need to work with CSC on prioritization if there are any issues.

John/Chris,

I talked to Bob Gresch this morning.  His recommendation was to complete a WIP for this request. The WIP process will be the most expodicious method.

He can complete one WIP for both:
MV90 interval data to FTP site (daily)
MV90 interval data to MDMA (daily)


Bob can help you complete the WIP form.  Bob can be reached at 5-5678.

Thanks,
Robert

In an effort to centralize information uncovered in various meetings, I have put together a short document covering *my* understanding of the meter data flow. Please take a look at ...

     http://172.24.5.129:90/sp/doc/project/analysis/meterdataanalysis.html

...and reply with any corrections, additions and feedback--I will incorporate them into the document.


Pat Priest has told us that if we could get a WIP in by today regarding the daily download of meter data from MV-90, CSC might be able to turn something around to us by next week. Who is in charge of this process? Who gives the go-ahead?

--John

Jim, 
	As per Dan, I am contacting you for help in setting up a common drive accessible for both EES and Corp users.

I understand that the system allows for CORP user to access EES resources but no vice/versa

In either case, the Corp users that are now assigned to EES projects request 2 NT Groups created that both EES and Corp users can be added to that will allow RW for on group and the other to allow Change to a common directory easily accessible by both groups (with out requiring separate logon).

The Erequest for access should be routed to Jeff Richter (jrichte) for approvals.

Please let me know how long it may be until we can have something available.  If you need anything else please let me know.

Regards, 

Dave

What is weird is that Jeff S. is still in the building, so it must have truly been his decision. They are issuing more stk, but I have not yet heard the details on how that will work. As far as Greg, I have heard very little on what lead up to his final departure. I know that his son had just had an operation and I think there may have been some complications. Then throw in a new born and watch the stress level rise.

Thanks for the update - off the record, does Gregory know what he is doing? I'll have to give him a call. 
On another subject, has Ken Lay taken odds that if he "opens" the books now, he can go back to cooking them later?  Also, heard that the big e had to issue more stock to retain employees - are you so lucky or does your contract tie you up?

Jeff,
	Here is a first cut of some of the questions that  need to be answered by the generator that is offering this service. I will have more as I dig into the detail this    	week.

			1) Non performance by counterparty (don't deliver energy when called) :
                                                       - Who is going to be held financially responsible if the generator is unable to meet the ISO instructions to Inc or Dec gen? 
			2)  Is the generator located in the grid or out of the grid?
			        - This is important to know so that we can evaluate our control area risk.
                                                3)   Has the generator registered and been certified by the ISO to deliver all of the A/s Products(Regulation,Spin, Non-Spin and Replacement)
			        - Need to know the specific unit ID's of the performing units so that we can verify w/ the ISO.
                                                4)   Are we paying the Generator based on what we bid in to the ISO or on what the ISO actually grants to EPMI. 
			5)   Are we paying the Generator a fixed price on Capacity and Energy or just passing through what the ISO pays EPMI minus losses for energy.
			   




		Other risks that we need to take look at as EPMI
			1)   Will the revenue stream coming in from the A/S payments put EPMI at risk of becoming a Creditor to the ISO instead of a Debtor.
			2)   EPMI reputation w/ the ISO if the Generator has perpetual non-performance issues. This could impact all of our A/S business if the ISO feels 
			       that EPMI is not able to meet its A/S obligation to the ISO on a consistent basis.
			3)   Need to make sure that they have language in the contract that covers EPMI and EES if we loss a dispute to the ISO. 
                                                4)   Risk to EPMI if the generator fails to deliver energy and the ISO takes back all capacity payment back to the last time in which EPMI
			       performed on an energy call. I think this is based on the entire EPMI portfolio not just for a specific unit. I will need to check on this item
			        Monday.

Pamela,
	I understand that you are getting your information from the schedulers, my question is at what point in the process. Is this the info that is originally sent to the server with no updates? If so, then we are going to keep having variances until we get you more up to date information. I know that the Calf. schedulers send a new file to EES after the close of the Day Ahead Mrkt, yet I don't see these updated numbers reflected in the schedules that you sent me. Find out from your schedulers if this is the original schedule that is sent to us on the server, and if so, are they updating the file after the changes in the Day-Ahead Mrkt. I want to make sure that you and I are chasing true variances and not timing variances.
						
						Thanks

Melissa,
	The payments that we need to send out to these counter parties are listed below. These payments are being made based off of our estimates for both the month of Nov. and Dec. The Nov. payment is being calculated at 23 cents on a dollar (Due to the ISO short-pay) while the Dec. payment is dollar for dollar.  We will then actualize both Nov. and Dec before the close of the May accounting month. Please give me call if you have any questions on this topic.

Subject:	Change Notification - Consumption

It is now apparent that the Change Notification Process, in particular Material Changes in Consumption, is more convoluted than what first appeared. To that end I am proposing the following:

1. A standing meeting to be held on Wednesdays at 2.00pm for the next 4 weeks to address the issues and formalize a Process Flow for each occurrence.
2. Draft Process Flow Documents to be prepared in the interim and passed out ASAP to all relevant parties for comment.
3. All comments/issued to be addressed through the Wednesday meeting.

An invitation for the meeting will be sent out shortly. Your attendance at yesterday's meeting was instructive and appreciated. Let's all try and get a good solid system in place by mid-October.

Also, a request for the attached questions to be sent out was proposed. Please review the questions and provide comments and/or add other issues you feel are not addressed. Please send your replies to all in the distribution list above. (I will be out of the country for 2 weeks and not have access to e-mail).

 

Thank you for your participation.

Martin

Hi Chris. Since you will be going to baton rouge one weekend and then to New orleans the next, I changed your return flight on the ticket originating from Portland on 23jul to return IAH/PDX on 10aug the 940am flight. The other ticket we did originating in Portland on 30jul will be printed and used towards your next trip from Portland. This was the least expensive way to handle your traveling to Baton Rouge and New Orleans. If this is confusing, you may call me at 713-860-1155 for me to explain it better. I assume the last itineraries for Baton Rouge and New Orleans are okay to ticket. 
thanks

Stewart,

	I went over Murray's spreadsheet for the CDWR allocation and found some numbers that don't make since to me. I will talk to Murray the moment he walks in the door and get this e-mail to CDWR before 9:00am. There is an adjustment made to the multiplier for CDWR that is specific to only them as a counterparty.

Chris,

I believe you said all communications for this customer will be through Pam Carter?  I will be actualizing July soon and will send a file directly to Pam.  If that has changed and I need to add either of these folks, please let me know.

Also, we need to come up with a method wherein they can receive all of the details - currently we can only send a total tab via e-mail.  Let me know what shared folder you can access, or if you have another option.

Caroline,

In an effort to make better accruals and analyze our numbers, can you provide the ISO charges for EEMC and EES, both estimates and actuals, as they occur?  I think Accounting was originally on the distribution list, but with turnover we seem to be missing them monthly.  Please send them to Troy Klussmann, who will be the point person on this.  Thanks!

Pamela,
	Where do you get the numbers for the EEMC tab? Here are the stages of the process that I currently know about:
	
		1) EES sends the schedule  file to the EPMI server
		2) Calf. schedulers pull EES schedules into their portfolio and submit the information to the ISO.
		3) ISO sends back Day Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES original schedule)
		4) ISO Sends back Hour Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES schedule from the Day Ahead Market)

	As you can see, there is quite a few places that changes can occur to an EES schedule in the course of a day. So I am trying to follow the information flow on both the EES side and the EPMI side. If the only schedule you see is the one that is originally sent to the  EPMI server, then I can see where we have the potential to have many unexplained variances. If this is the case, this may be nothing more than providing you with the incremental information that is provided by the ISO during the course of a given day. Just update me on your process flow, and I will keep this issue moving along until completion.

								Thanks
								  Chris

Chris,  the spreadsheet below contains the HA_Finals that you send to me(EPMI) as well as the scheduled volumes sent from the scheduling group(EES).  The volumes on the EPMI tab is inconsistent with the EEMC tab.  Please review the variance sheet tab which will denote the days, zone and hours where the difference occur.    I am assuming the EPMI numbers are incorrect because of the hour by hour consistency on the EEMC  spreadsheet.  However,  this assumption could be incorrect.   Again, please review and let me know. 

Thanks,

Pam

Linda,
     I am ok with the  most of the Audit plan except for the date of
completion. August 2001 seems quite excessive since we now have one SQMD
audit under our belts. Please provide to me the logic behind the thought
that this Audit will take over 3mths to complete.

                                         Thanks
                                          Chris

I am trying to find out if the data from MV90 get interfaced into MDMA on a daily basis
or not.  If it is done on a daily basis, then I don't think there is a need to go into MV90.
MV90 will have raw data and will not have gone through validations which are performed

A leopard never changes its spots! Is this an after thought since they heard you were going to leave? I would be worried about any position that I felt needed arm twisting to get to in the end. Sounds like a good opportunity, but I wonder why it is now coming to the surface and what is behind it. I am bias, I don't trust anyone on that side of the pond so I may not be the best person to give an objective answer. You have a good feel for people, go w/ your gut. You knew in you the back of your mind that this is the way that it would go down at the end of the day. Get some more opinions and then go w/ your instincts.

The opportunity here has been enhanced;   in addition to Managing RT,   I would be managing all of the Service Assets in Texas.   This includes trading around a 500 mw plant,   serving EES and New Power Company loads,  and also the potential for managing a new 1500 mw full requirements deal. 
Of course,  I would have to have all of this in writing.      I would be working with the Texas Term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position.
This makes the offer more attractive,  but still I would be in Houston.      I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure.
What do you think?

Couple of questions:

1)	Did you have any luck getting me upgraded to Gold?
2)	Did they get back with you on the FF miles for automated check in?



Also, I will try to knock out my expenses today and send those to you. I also want to send you and e-mail I got from TAP and get your interpretation.

Gang,
	I want to make it very clear that the questions I am having Pam ask are not meant to put anyone one on the defensive. From what I can tell so far, we have a process that is at best inefficient and at worst broken. Pam will be asking a lot of questions going forward because she does not know your process and she is on task to learn it. Please have patience and offer guidance on how we can get these issues resolved so we can better put to use everyone's time. We are all paid to fix problems, not point fingers. I have a lot of faith in the people in the Portland office, that is why I am asking Pam to go to you guys for guidance. If anyone has any issues going forward please feel free to contact me at 503-807-8959 or e-mail me. 

							          Thanks
								Chris

Pam -

I am your Hour-Ahead, or Real Time, contact. I've attached all of my contact information below. You can also find this information attached to the EES Hourly sheet I send you each day.

Kysa is your Day-Ahead contact. Her phone number is 503-464-7486.

If you can tell me more specifically a) what kind of problems you're running into with the CARP report and our sheets, and b) whether the problems are related to the EES Daily sheet (which outlines day-ahead deals) or the EES Hourly sheet (which outlines real time deals), then I can be of more assistance. As I said in my last e-mail, I've gone over all the variances you've sent, and none appear to be related to hourly deals. I've also attached the reconciliation model I maintain each day so you can see how I've tied out Enpower to the hourly model for every day in September.

Please let me know if I can do anything else to help.

Thanks,

Brenda,
Here are the events as I know them
1)	On 7/25/01 this item was brought to the attention of varies members of a team meeting for Project Ranger. At that point, it was  agreed that this item should be high priority and Robert Bailey offered to push it forward.
2)	On Friday(7/27/01) I got a call from John Rutledge asking if he is the person that is supposed to enter  the WIP to CSC. John had never had any dealing w/ filling out a WIP, plus he is unsure if he is the person to fill it out. (Ball drop number one)
3)	WIP is finally submitted on 7/30/01. I got a call from Jacqueline Johnson on 8/2/01 asking a bunch of questions about the work request that was submitted by John. At that point I ask why I am just now being contacted if the WIP was submitted on Monday(7/30/01). Jacqueline then goes on to tell me that she has not been in the office that week and is just now getting around to reviewing our WIP request. I then ask why she did not have a backup covering her during her absence and told her she needs to get this out the door ASAP. (Ball drop number two)
4)	Brenda sends out an e-mail on Friday asking for an update from Richard Miller on the CSC issue. Yesterday at about 11:30 I sent an e-mail to Richard asking for an up date on the e-mail that Brenda sent out. I then get a call from Richard and Steve Walker in which they both told me that this item is not showing as an emergency item to CSC. Both told me that it was never conveyed to them that this was an emergency item, but  they will now escalated it to such. (Ball drop number three)

In summary, John should have been given a lot more guidance in filling the WIP out and getting it submitted to CSC since he has no prior relationship with CSC. As far as the rest of the items listed, I am unsure of where the disconnect in communication occurred at this time. Lastly, where does Robert Gresch fit in all of this since he is the one that I conveyed my concern about this item not looking like it was escalated to emergency status(7/26/01)?

Richard and Bob,
What is the status?  It is my understanding that the work request was not even received until Monday, 7/30.  I also understand that CSC (Steve Walker) worked with John Rutledge to define the work request.  I would like some insight into Chris' comment on the "ball being dropped."  I know we were all clear internally that this was a priority.  

Has CSC escalated this?  What is their timeline to deliver?  Let me know ASAP.

Richard,
	This is the last e-mail that I got from Mr. Gresch. As you can see, I am asking if this has been escalated to something other than the normal process. From the conversation we just had, I guess the level of priority never made it's way to you. While I am not sure who dropped the ball on this item, the fact remains that it was dropped and another week of information that is crucial to the intramonth book was missed. From this point forward, I would like to know who I should be talking with when it comes to these types of issues so as to avoid this miscommunication in the future.

Subject:	RE: meter data documentation

Bob,
	I am a little confused, my understanding was that you would be able to escalate these items to get a quick turnaround time in comparison to going the normal process. What you are recommending sounds like the normal process, am I incorrect on that conclusion?  When can I expect to get feedback from CSC with the process listed below?

John/Chris - I spoke to Steve Walker with Team Enron this morning about your request.  He'll be contacting you to help fill out the request form and get it submitted.  When the request is completed, it should be forwarded to Jacqueline Jackson in my group for submission to CSC.  With respect to your time for completion requirements, we'll need to work with CSC on prioritization if there are any issues.

Kristian,

	I met with Tim today to inform him of my intentions to pursue opportunities outside of the Portland office. It seem to go very well, w/ TIm also saying that he had expressed an interest in working in London. He did make sure and state that the London office is the highest cost office in all of Enron, and therefore would probably be the first on to experience layoffs if the economy took a downturn. His thought is that he wants to see if he can get me into something on the floor by mid year, but would support me if I decide to go elsewhere. The tougher issue is going to be telling Murray of my intentions. What do I do now to start truly pursuing a job in the London office?

Subject:	California Refund Proceeding--Got some exhibits to prepare--Confidential Atty Client Work Product

I met with Gary Fergus and we determined the  need to prepare affidavits and/or exhibits as part of our August 15th showing in the Califronia refund case. 

Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness).

 I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits:

Witness designations are preliminary.

1. EPMI's receivables from ISO/PX
What it shows:  ISO owes us $41.5 million and the PX $9.1 million plus any claims we want to make w.r.t. letters of credit with the PX
Sponsor: Tracy Ngo (PX data) and Murray O'Neil (ISO data)  (Tracy has agreed to prepare the exhibit but wants support from Murray's group on the ISO numbers.) 

2. EPMI's "receivables" from ISO for the underscheduling penalty
What it shows:  ISO has yet to actually implement the underscheduling penalty but has been tracking it.  According to information provided Chris Stockly, EPMI would receive $30 million of penalty revenues 
Sponsor:  Chris Stokley or Murray O'Neil

3. Enron's PX credit receivables
What it shows:  PG&E and SCE collectively owe EES $500 million
Sponsor: Steve Swain or ??

As part of Project Ranger, it is my goal to have a single repository to house all actual data, allowing users to access data through an ad hoc reporting tool.  Additionally, as areas identify needs, I would hope that we can develop feeds rather than just ad hoc reporting.
 
We are setting up a meeting with CSC for this Wednesday to discuss the needs and start defining Iteration 2 of the project.  Vivian forwarded me this meeting that you have already set-up.  My question:  Without knowing the full scope of your efforts, I'd like to propose a single initiative to obtain actuals.  Additionally, we wanted to set-up this meeting for Wednesday when the CSC business analyst is in town.  Do you think it would be advantageous to combine the meetings, and schedule it for Wednesday?  
 
We will move forward with our efforts and will schedule a meeting for Wednesday.  If you all want to combine efforts, please let me know and we will include you on the meeting.
 
Chris - I had already included both you and Murray on the invitation listing.  Will you forward this E-mail to him?  I'm having problems trying to call up his E-mail address.
 
Please let me know.

Take a look at this document. The section with major players is the one with the utilities that are tied to an index, however, there are some minor utilities that are not covered in that list. Do you think that we need the minor utilities?

Chris,

I couldn't remember if I sent you an email or not.  So I am going back and doing it.  On June 22 my daughter Elizabeth was born.  7 lbs 6 oz, 19.5 inches.  She is a handful.

I never knew how much I liked sleep before she came.  She already has Dad wrapped around her finger.  Hope all is well.

Greg

Guys -

Please review my amended requirements for the Baseline/Bandwidth project.  I
think the approach will be relatively simple, with a lot of data entry on
the side of our staff.  That notwithstanding, I think that our requirements
are pretty solid, with the exception of the code/calculations required for
actually establishing baselines/bands where they do not exist.  We will need
to establish processes and procedures for doing so; this for the staff
actually performing the contract-by-contract work.  We should discuss this
stuff again today.  thanks.

 << File: Keoni.zip >> <<Keoni.zip>> Chris, per your request here are the 480 and 1480 charges
that have been tracked to date for Enron.  Please keep in mind that the
systems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements
process so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not
applied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should
not be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become
effective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the
Settlement process. 

I checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during
September. 
Take care.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do.  Otherwise, I will return to settling "normally" with them.

The son said, "why are  you so weak?"

Ann confirmed that Hertzberg had called Lynch asking for them to delay.
And, of course the PUC accommodated them today.  Ann said however, that she
was not able to hold the decision until July 12.  The reason is that a
letter from the Treasurer, DWR and Finance was sent to Commissioners and
legislators telling them that DA had to be suspended by June 28 in order fo=
r
appeals etc. to be settled by the time the issue the bonds in August.  I
believe someone else referenced this letter in an e-mail yesterday.  Ann is
appending the letter to the Bilas alternate so everyone can see it and
comment.  Also, they are going to ask for comments on going to "bottoms up"
rates.

My back office has explained that we have received our  final payment for September business.  Thank you for the processing on that  part of the transaction.  We have, however, invoiced EPMI for interest  payments based on the understanding we had reached at my meeting in your offices  late last year.  The two interest invoices we have sent are for $16,359.28  and $4,530.74, for a total of $20,890.02.  To date, no payments have been  made by EPMI.  Could you look into the status of the processing on these  bills for us?
 
Thanks,
Steve

	I need to give Jeff Ricter an update on where this item stands with CSC. I am still going off of the e-mail listed below stating that CSC could meet this deliverable by sometime this week. This is the item that we talked about in last week's Project Ranger meeting, and agreed needed to put on the high priority list.

Subject:	RE: FW: CSC UPDATE

Chris,

In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  

Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  

I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. 

The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Maurice

Chris,

I just wanted to take a moment to let you know what a great job Kit is doing.  He is energetic, inquisitive and consistently takes the necessary initiative to get the job done.

He asks all of the right questions, especially "why?," which inspires me to tune up my own knowledge and skills.  It is refreshing to have someone like him join the group and I anticipate that he'll be able to handle allocations completely by the end of next week.

Thank you for your foresight and for the help.

Donna

Gawd Boy - you have more questions for me...does this mean you do not require my assistance with CA Block Forwards?  Since you NEVER returned my phone calls??  What's the poop scoop on Jeff S?
Dennis left the NW about a year ago and went to Louisiana I think. Somewhere down around your parts. 
Hey, is that Steve guy - can't remember his last name - still working in Fundies?  He worked with Jim B. in Structuring before they got uppity and went to Broadband. Then Steve came back and Jim went to Houston - THAT Steve.  What's his last name and is he still there?

	We are missing one significant piece of info in this document. We need to add the charges associated Positive and Negative  Load Deviation (Penalty Charges). I don't think that there are any for Positive Dev., but I know that there are charges associated to Neg. Dev.

Please attend a premeeting on Thursday 3:00 in 3109 to discuss the above item.

The objective of this meeting is to discuss our strategy and process required to fill our wholesale and retail needs in Ercot as a group.  We need to define the process that we will be using to fill the Ercot load from the wholesale/retail markets starting from the meter to the wholesale settlement process.  This needs to be a common vision and documented process between us for all.

This premeeting will allow us all to get ready for Nancy and capture any additional action items for the above objective.

Please ensure that any additional staff required are invited.

Chris, 

We are planning to use the following days to gather data for the ISO audit:

Februay 5, 2000
June 11, 2000
July 15, 2000
August 7, 2000
December 28, 2000

No data is taken from 1999 due to the conversion from CHEOPS to MDMA.
The 5 days represent high UFE days from each quarter of 2000 (see ISO analysis).
July 15 and August 7 were included on the resubmittal analysis you provided.
December 28 is an "exit" sample from the audit period.

Please respond with any concerns or comments.

Thanks,

Ken

I will look into what timeline that we can get these guys paid on and talk with you today. As far as the other issue, we are no where close to being able to take that project on. The current new hires are just to get us caught up in the short term. After that, then it may be a do able item, but right now all I want the new guys concentrating on is getting us caught up. I see this hand-off taking place sometime in the 3rd qtr of this year, when we get the rest of our staff in place.

Subject:	Willamette

Chris,

I just received a call from Willamette Ind. concerning our future business. It seems Aquila is making a proposal for Willamette's business. 
Willamette is reasonably satisfied with their Enron relationship with the exception of the time it takes for Enron to settle California business.  They mentioned that timely settlement of the outstanding balances for November and December would be helpful in discussions with their upper management.

I'm confident that Enron will retain Willamette's business, but it would be extremely helpful if we can get them paid for CISO business for November and December before the end of April. 

Let me know what Volume Management needs from Services to get Willamette paid for Nov. and Dec.

On another topic, with your new hires coming soon can we shift the settlements for Services Customers, like we've discussed, to Volume Management?


Regards,


Les Rawson

fyi

Here are some questions and answers that you will find helpful:
*	Are self provided ancillary services (on a SC required basis)
sequential; excess spin rolls into nonspin requirement for the SC (if
offered
as nonspin).

 NO, If an SC self provides 130 MW of SPIN capacity yet the calculated
market requirement is only 100MW,  the self-provided amount of 120 MW will
be accepted for SPIN and none of the EXCESS 30 MW of capacity considered for
other A/S services.

Please Note if in this example the SC's SPIN obligation is calculated to be
90 MW, the over self provided portion (100MW - 90MW) = 10 MW would receive a
payment.  In this example there is an additional 20 MW of EXCESS above the
total market requirement that "gets left on the table" which will receive no
compensation.


*	If self provision reserves are offered in excess of the total
quantity required for the total market, will the ISO take them all anyway or
will the offerings be truncated and perhaps roll into a subsequent service
(if offered as self provide in that service).

NO, As in the above answer.  The total Self provided quantity will be
accepted and there would be no reduction of the preferred schedule even if
this amount is ABOVE the total market requirement.

I would agree, but I didn't think Kevin followed the Catholic faith so I moved him over to the Mormon faith. A lot of people I work w/ are Mormon and they remind me of old school Catholics, lots of kids.

Hey Stoke,

You were surprise about the baby! Just imagine how shocked we were - all
this time we figured it was a beer gut. If you are in Houston, we'll have to
get together on one of the weekends that you stay in town. The job search is
"...like jerking-off with a cheese grader, its slightly amusing , but mostly
painful." -Andrew Dice Clay

I disagree with the Mormon comment; as a matter of fact, I believe he is
doing great at upholding the catholic teachings regarding birth control.
Seriously, I believe this one is the last of his flock.

Bud,
	I had zero idea that Kevin had another baby on the way until he
sent out the pictures. He will need to convert to being a Mormon soon if
he keeps having kids. What is your latest on the job search? I am
currently on a 6-mth project in Houston, so forgive me if my responses
are not prompt.

		The room was full of pregnant women and their partners,
and the Lamaze class  was in full swing.

		The instructor was teaching the women how  to breathe
properly, along with informing the men how to give the  necessary
assurances at this stage of the plan.

		The  instructor then announced, "Ladies, exercise is
good for you.  Walking is especially beneficial. And, gentlemen, it
wouldn't hurt  you to take the time to go walking with your partner!"

		The  room really got quiet. Finally, a man in the middle
of the group  raised his hand. "Yes?" replied the instructor.

		"Is it all  right if she carries a golf bag while we
walk?"

Murray, thanks for your interest in leveraging the Gutenberg work.  Here's the draft Overview.  The visio documents are not the most current, but I've asked the consultants to produce a binder this morning and also e-mail you all of the most current process flows as well as the Pricing and Booking disconnect detail you requested.

I 'd like very much to learn more how you would see expediting progress through the EWS processes and tools, and hope you'll work with us as soon as possible to see what might be possible.

Murray and Chris, we made good progress last week on the approach that best meets the Everest kick off and as likely coordinates most effectively across the impacted groups.  I'd like to get with you to review status and explore more carefully impact / interactions on your other activities.  I've just started talking carefully with Vivian and Neal, to resume tomorrow afternoon.  Can you suggest a time when we could meet?  Thanks.

completion. August 2001 seems quite excessive since we now have one SQMD
audit under our belts. Please provide to me the logic behind the thought
that this Audit will take over 3mths to complete.

Jo Ellen,

	The document below should be a starting point for our discussion this afternoon. I should give you a pretty good idea of the variables we are trying to capture in the Deal Ticket. I will be speaking w/ Steve Walker this afternoon to flush this all out in  greater detail. If you have any question please call me at 503-807-8959.

Hi Chris,	
	
	I wanted to check on California Energy Resouces Scheduling - the piece they disputed paying us in February.  Virginia had in DMS that you are handling this now. So, to refresh your memory, they did not pay us $186,000 in February - broken down as follows:

Deal #533136.1  2/1/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/2/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/3/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/5/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/6/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So they are saying these weren't theirs until the 7th.

Thus my accounts receiveable shows that we have been shorted $186,000.  I need to know if I can collect this from them or if we will change the deals so that they will not be charged for the above days they are disputing.  I really need to get this fixed as soon as possible - since this shows possible exposure to us if we can't collect or DPR to the West if we have to remove these deals for the above days.

Let me know if you have any questions and let me know what info. you have.

Thanks!
Amy

Chris,

Thanks for your reply.  I received the ISO requirements and timeline; the
requirements appear to be materially consistent with prior year.  We can set up
a call to discuss the audit as early as next week, as we are in the midst of our
earnings release testing this week.  Would next Thursday morning around 9:00
a.m. (your time) work? Any other time on Thursday would work with our schedules.

Thanks,
Linda

Kristian,
	
	I finally grew some balls and had my meeting with Murray. It went really well, a lot different than I expected. I now have to meet w/ Tim so that he can lay out what opportunities he thinks exist on the floor. That should be interesting. I will get in early tomorrow, and give you a call to give you an update. I have not sent my accomplishments b/c I wanted to hear what Tim had to say as far as opportunities on the floor. The last thing I want to do is have Paul take the time to go pass around my resume and me not follow through on those potential offers. Talk to you tommorow.

Chris,

This is Richter, Neil had reviews to do so I finished up with the email.  Hope this helps.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Richter

Several deals have no band (1998 ) see note from Dennis
+
The issue with the bands is how to price them.  On the surface the band is the same as selling the customer a call and a put 
in actual fact the customer is not going to always exercise the option on a purely economic basis. Building managers need to keep the lights on even when it is hot. +
Most of our contracts contemplate the establishment of a baseline during the first year of the contract. Most of our consumption bands are settled on an annual basis giving the client a huge swing on an intramonth basis. 
+
New clients have consumption bands which are calculated on a monthly basis and settled with the customer on an annual basis. 
+
We don't currently manage the position aggressively.  Intramonth we forecast load for clients and assume all the load is physical when in fact after a customer goes over (or under) the band we should be buy index for the over under. 

Chris,  Richter takes over

1999 deals:  most deals in 1999 have a consumption band which gets settled annually.  

2000 deals as of feb - consumption bands with monthly settlements

New deals  - See Neil's notes above

One thing to remember is that the customer is exposed to hourly index price and grid charges on every kw they use outside the band and we owe them if they underconsume.  this needs to be flashed and then actualized when the data is available.  One note is that all the existing contracts up to EWS taking over have this little flaw:  the customer is exposed to the hourly price and we wear the risk of all the grid charges.  (Not good!!!)

Chris, Michael--

I've been looking at some of the MV-90 files from CSC. Here's what I have found:

There are 1200 to 1400 meters reported each day. We will need to keep an eye on this number to see what kind of growth to expect.
Almost all meters report in 15 minute intervals. Interestingly enough, one meter (UCSF CUP 3), started reporting 5 minute intervals on 6 August, and has done so ever since.
The current prototype application I am using to read this data into a temporary database reads about 1meter per second, so I am averaging around 20 minutes per file. While I think I can improve the speed of this process, it does not take into account the need to map this data to the correlating account data, so any gains may be lost there.
Although some of the datafiles are complete (4 readings per hour X 24 hours X every meter) others are missing quite a lot of data. ("9 missing readings for meter KZ+029402367...87 missing readings for meter KZ+029402370...15 missing readings for meter KZ+029402392...") I will work with CSC next week to figure out what is causing this extreme variance in the dependability of the data from day to day.

Next week I will be looking into MDMA to match up these meter ids with accounts. I will let you know what I find.

John,

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

Subject:	CES2423 Project Proposal

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

First off, I am still confused on how this whole thing plays out myself. I will be flying into Houston quite a lot in the short term to get a feeling for what is currently in place for EES. Tim wants Don Black to stay in place for the short term to help him make his way through this mess called EES. Don Black has not been with EES that long, so he is not being hit w/ any of the blame for the current problems. I should have a clearer picture of what is going on in the next couple of weeks.


				Ps   I am now an Associate.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Subject:	El Paso Dec Calif. PX Shortfall - never received

The Following invoice was sent in February to collect for the California PX Shortfall - entered as an annuity Deal #508664.1

 

El Paso should have paid $889,898.71 to Enron atleast by the 2/5/01 (since invoice was sent on Feb 2nd to be paid on receipt).

As of 5/8/01, they are 93 days late.

According to their WSPP contract the interest rate is 1% per month prorated until paid.

El Paso needs to then pay the original $889,898.71 + $27,208.65 in interest.(see below for calculation of interest)
		1% x 12 months = interest for a year = 12%
		12% / 365 days = interest for a day   = .0329%
	          .0329% x 93days    = proration of interest for 2/5-5/8 = 3.0575%
	$889,898.71 x 3.0575%   = interest due to Enron for late pay = $27,208.65	

Let me know if I need to call my contact at El Paso about this late payment or if you want to call her.  In case you do, it's Kathy Peterson (915) 543-2039.

Then,  let me know whether you want me to send an invoice for the interest.  Either way I need to collect the $889,898.71 - since it's sitting on my Accounts Receiveable - flagged as past due. - so just let me know what I need to do and how you want to handle this.

Thanks so much and let me know if you need anymore information. - Amy

This email is to summarize how i think we are going to book the LA AS transactions so as to ensure smooth settlements and month end.  Whoever intiates the deal will put in two enpower transactions:

Transaction One:  This one represents ENA buying AS from LA at the agreed upon capacity price and volume

Transaction Two:  This one represents ENA selling AS to EES at an agreed upon price and volume (Once Bill finishes his assessment of work he will work with Neil to determine what fee is appropriate  - this fee will be embedded in the price he sells to EES).

Lastly any time the AS gets exercised Bill's group will put the energy in caps and enpower.

If you have any questions or comments on the process let me know.

FYI?

I left Mark a message today indicating that I was not comfortable that they were capturing all of the different parameters associated with Baseline and Bandwidth on our current contracts correctly.  My biggest concern here is that we need to make sure that CSC who is doing our billing is reflecting the same information.  There needs to be an action items which I thought was started two weeks ago to ensure that everything which is needed by CSC on the Deal Ticket is captured by us on our deal tickets so we can on populate a deal ticket once.  The ultimate would be that we have more on our deal ticket then CSC needs and they can pull just their relative elements.

	Operations have for some time communicated the consumption excess and deficiency charges to CSC on the deal request form in the comments section. They have also indicated the method of calculation. We strongly suspect that these are not being charged correctly and as a result Barry VanDerHoarst and I am currently running an investigation of 10 randomly selected deals to check the CSC pricing calculations.

AK,

Thanks for the voicemail yesterday.  This is what I need confirmation on:

Power - Are the consumption bands being captured on the del sheets?  Are they being communicated to CSC for invoicing purposes?  If they are being captured and communicated, what day did this start?  It had to be within the last week.  If they are not being captured and communicated to CSC, it needs to start ASAP and I would like confirmation of the official start day.

Gas - It is my understanding that they are being captured on the deal sheets and in the Risk books.  I have confirmed that CSC is billing over/ undertakes.  I just want to make sure that the deal sheets, when consolidated with the customer/new deal set-up with CSC, continues to capture that information.

Thanks for your help.

This is what I know.

The DASH definitely captures the consumption band.  As I understand it, a consumption risk book is not up and running.  I believe Mallik's intention is to have in running by the end of the year.

If you need anything else come see me.

	I apologize for being such a pain in the ass, but  I will not be in the office today due to sickness. I think I have some form of streep(?) throat( rash around my neck and very painful to swallow). Reschedule the 11:00 Genesis meeting for any open time after 1:00 tomorrow, the rest of the meeting I will try to call in on. Feel free to call me, I will be online working if you need anything from me. I feel well enough to work, just worried that I might be contagious.

Diann,

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

Subject:	Site Profile / Consumption Issues in our contracts


Chris,

As a follow up of our conversation, here is a summary of contract issues. I have tried to organize my comments into three major categories: baseline, bands and material change language.

Where Contracts were prior to Site Profile Desk took control

Baseline: Not specified in contracts! A variety of mechanisms to build baseline post-contract including:
Calculating volumes on a forward basis, i.e first 12 months
Last 12 months prior to contract closing
Baseline volumes that grow by x%
Bands: Annual 90/110 bands, Aggregation at all levels (including utility, state and national etc.)
Material Change Language: Varied, unclear or vague language (at least in my opinion)


Where we are now

Baseline: Two basic mechanisms intended to bring clarity
Major Transactions (i.e. any deal not priced from Matrix): volumes explicitly specified in contract
Minor transactions: last 12 months prior to contract closing (with the understanding that Origination will collect 12 bills required for booking within days of contract closing; process details to be finalized)
Bands: Monthly 90/110 bands, Aggregation allowed within same utility-voltage-facility type groupings
Material Change Language: Unfortunately still unclear and inadequate (see below for our proposals). For example, the 


Where we want to be

Baseline:
Minor transactions: A process needs to be in place in Services Department to collect the 12 bills required for booking within days of contract closing.

Material Change Language: This area needs to be really beefed up. In my opinion, material language should catch risks that are not explicitly modeled and priced. At the moment, I don't see material change language accomplishing this. 

Issue 1: Protecting for long term shifts in consumption

The 90/110 consumption bands (which are set on monthly basis) we are offering right now are intended to provide normal weather and operating flexibility. With this assumption, we currently price consumption risk as a probabilistic process as opposed to pricing using the classic straddle approach (simultaneous call & put).  Any "step" changes in consumption, such as The Limited adding additional display area or Tyco Health Care Products, adding new production shifts violate this assumption.  I propose either (1) adding language that captures this "steps" or (2) price these steps explicitly. Given the lack of quality actual data the second alternative would be an educated guess at this point.  Recently I proposed (verbally to be fair) the following language to Jim Wood (Products-Origination).

If a "Material Change" (defined below) has occurred, EESO or Customer may request that the commodity pricing be restructured to account for such Material Change.  A "Material Change" shall be any intentional or unintentional change, including energy efficiency upgrades, to the processes or operations conducted at any of the Facilities or other similar occurrences that:

(i)	change a Facility Account's consumption of electricity or natural gas at such Facility Account by more than 10% of the Facility Account's Consumption Baseline over any six consecutive months (i.e. Facility Account's Actual Consumption divided by Facility Account's Baseline Consumption equals less than 0.9 or more than 1.1), or 

(ii)	change a Facility Account' s monthly on-peak usage ratio for electricity at such Facility Account by more than 5% of Facility Account's monthly on-peak usage ratio baseline over any six consecutive months.  The Facility Account monthly on-peak usage ratio equals the monthly on-peak Facility Account usage divided by the total monthly Facility Account usage.

Jim's immediate reaction was mixed. He felt that customers may feel that we are giving them volumetric flexibility on one hand and taking it back with the other. He said 80/120 on material change may be more palatable.

Issue 2: Sudden Load Swings in Short Term

Although, the monthly bands protect us on monthly volume swings, they are not very effective in preventing sudden un-planned short term load swings triggering imbalance penalties. Here the language currently in contracts that is supposed to protect us against this risk:

Notice of Operational Changes.  You agree to promptly advise us of any event reasonably known to you that may impact energy usage at any Account (e.g., equipment installations, outages, shutdowns, repairs, openings or closings, changes in operating hours) by an amount (without regard to weather-related effects) greater than either (i) 25% of the Actual Usage for such Account during the same Billing Cycle in the prior year or (ii) 2 MW (each an "Operational Change").  If you fail to notify us of an Operational Change, you will reimburse us for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by you or us as a result of such Operational Change.  

This language has at least three problems:
No compensation mechanism specified if customer does not deliver on this requirement.
Is 25% and / or 2 MW justifiable, especially given the differences in imbalance treatment across physical markets?
No clear process (i.e. minimum time frame for notice, contact information) specified for customer to deliver this notice

I would modify this language to something like:

Notice of Operational Changes.  Customer agrees to advise EESI at least two days (48 hours) in advance to the contacts listed in Schedule ____ by fax or e-mail of any event that may impact energy demand at any of its Accounts (e.g., equipment installations, outages, shutdowns, repairs, openings or closings, changes in operating hours) by an amount greater than either (i) ___ % of the Hourly Load for such Account during the same hour in the prior year or (ii) 0.5 MW of demand (each an "Operational Change").  If such Customer fails to notify EESI of an Operational Change, Customer will reimburse EESI for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by the Customer or EESI as a result of such Operational Change.  The mechanism for penalty calculation is specified in Schedule ____.
Hope this helps.

Here are the deals I spoke to you about over the  phone.  These are hourly deals however, based on the information that is on APX's website I can't seem to match these deals with anything.

The deal numbers are: 595705, 595714, 595819.  They were traded at the end of April.

Thanks very much for your help.

Evelyn

Energy Novice to Be Paid $240,000 
 Power: Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one year's experience in the field. State officials say she is doing a good job. 


By JEFFREY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers





     The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a year's experience in the energy industry $240,000 annually to head a team of traders who secure California's daily electricity supply. 
     State officials hired Susan T. Lee, 30, in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov. Gray Davis. 
     Lee's contract is equal to the $20,000 a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman, a top utility executive for decades. 
     The two-year contract will pay Lee up to $480,000 to oversee the state's day-to-day energy purchases, totaling billions of dollars a year. 
     Lee's contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nation's largest power buyers, a role that it took on in January as California's utilities faltered. 
     Lee's contract was one of about a dozen released Monday, and among the largest. 
     Reached at her Sacramento office, Lee would not discuss her contract. She said only that she heads a 15-person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep California's power flowing. 
     Pete Garris, a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee, said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy. 
     He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu, her boss at Mieco Inc., a trading firm in Long Beach, recommended her. Shimizu refused comment Tuesday. 
     The state, according to Garris, must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game. 
     "You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary," Garris said. "Unless we can get permanent and full-time positions approved, these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [consultants]." 
     Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lee's contract with the six-month, $120,000 deal that Freeman--the former boss at several major utilities--struck with the governor. 
     "I don't want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman," Garris said. "David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a [private] power marketer. With Susan, we just followed the standard formula." 
     In her new job, Lee will direct an immensely complicated, around-the-clock operation responsible for "procuring energy, scheduling power and associated transmission, and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries," according to her contract. 
     Lee's resume, attached to the contract, shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March 2000, when she joined Mieco. There, she was a trader and power scheduler, not a manager. 
     "She was only here for a year or so," said Dina Alvarez, an administrative manager for the company. 
     A 1994 graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics, she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco. 
     Lee's contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week, not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field. 
     She is being paid $120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $480,000, including expenses, by April 2003. 
     Another new consultant, William L. Green, has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration, Pacific Gas & Electric and the California Independent System Operator. He is being paid $85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state's accounting of energy purchases. His two-year deal is worth up to $340,000. 
     They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals. 
     Richard Ferreira, the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, has a $500,000 contract and is being paid $200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts. He worked for the Department of Water Resources for 23 years before joining the Sacramento agency in 1987. 
     Hardy Energy Consulting also has a $150,000, six-month contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid $300 an hour. Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience, particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration, where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997. 
     Lee's recruiter, Garris, said her lack of experience is not a concern. 
     "So far she's done an excellent job," he said. "She has the skills, and she has the ability. She was doing a similar job." 
     Dozens of consultants, including Lee, have been hired since January, when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power. 
     The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric because they were no longer considered credit-worthy, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources. 
     Hidalgo said that about 60% of the 95 people now working for the division are consultants. The rest are state employees. 
     As part of the process, Lee's unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed. Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months.

Hey Chris,

I hope all is continuing to go as well as can be expected in H-town.

I'm writing with a worry and am not sure the best way to approach it.  The =
gist of it is that I am worried about the VM group and their reputation on =
the floor.  I'll give you a couple of examples as to why:  1) Chris Mallory=
 came to me and starting asking me questions about charges that go w/ impor=
ts and exports--I briefly answered but told him to talk to VM.  He said he =
didn't really know who to talk to, who would be able to answer his question=
s w/out Heather, you or myself back there.  (and he also did not know Jim R=
eyes' name until he asked me yesterday), 2) Bill came over the Darren today=
, concerned that he had been charged cong incorrectly b/c when Bill had che=
cked CAISO, the cong prices were all $0.  Not a huge deal that this happene=
d, but Jim needs to be signing off on the Flash ( i don't know if he is or =
not) and cong charges should always be closely monitored; and I don't think=
 that this is the first day that Bill has been incorrectly charged cong 3) =
Richter asked me who would be the person in VM that should help Tim Coffing=
 (his new analyst that moved up here) to deal w/ looking at the EES wholesa=
le settlements.  Jeff didn't know who would be the best b/c he doesn't real=
ly know the VM team anymore.  (I suggested Kit b/c he seems to be good at d=
igging into problems and getting answers).

Essentially, I think that the traders do not know all of the new faces, wha=
t they are doing and who they should be talking to.  You were always very c=
oncerned about the visibility/availability of the VM team as well as the cr=
edibility and I think these are suffering right now.  And of course on top =
of all of this is VMS.

Do you think I should send this to Scotty? Murray?  Without any management =
being here, I think it is tough to keep a heartbeat on the feeling of the t=
raders and I think that is part of the problem.  And I assume things will i=
mprove w/ Scotty here, but he needs to build relationships on the floor as =
well. =20

I am not trying to be critical of anyone or step on any toes, but I am conc=
erned. =20

Please let me know what you think...thanks and sorry to add a little more t=
o your plate of concerns... KN

Here is the data model and data flow diagram for MDMA.  

  

I am trying to find out if the data from MV90 get interfaced into MDMA on a daily basis
or not.  If it is done on a daily basis, then I don't think there is a need to go into MV90.
MV90 will have raw data and will not have gone through validations which are performed
in MDMA.

Chris,

We have contacted Pat Priestley regarding obtaining the following data for the ISO audit.

We requested two sets of data.  One set which includes daily detail source data from a sample of meters before the application of distribution loss factors and load profiles, and a second set which includes the daily detail meter data that is summed within the SQMD file.  

For each UDC we requested data from 2 meters from each rate class (1 actual meter and 1 estimated meter).  In addition we requested 5 Enron meters from each UDC from different rate classes. The meter data should be taken from 2/15/00, 6/11/00, 7/15/00, 8/7/00, 12/28/00, respectively.

Pat has notified us that a WIP is required in order for us to obtain this data, please confirm if this is the case.

Regards,

Ken

Subject:	Question about Instructed/Uninstructed Energy Data Usage

Keoni,

We are, still, struggling to fully understand the Instructed/Uninstructed Energy data (IE), specifically the two columns that report Uninstructed Deviation and Uninstructed Energy.

The volumetric totals in one of these two columns is supposed to match the volume in the Settlement Detail file for Charge Type 407.  However, I have discovered a couple of (annoying) things in September:

In comparing the two columns within the table - 
For LocationTypes L and C, there is no volumetric difference between the two columns.

For LocationType G, there is a volumetric difference of 153.15 (more in the Deviation column than in the Energy column)

In comparing IE to the Settlement Statement data - 
When I use the volumes in the Uninstructed Energy column for all LocationTypes, I have a volumetric difference of 10.52 (less in the IE data).
However, when I use the Uninst Energy column for L and C, and the Deviation column for G, I then have a volumetric difference of 142.63 (less in the Settlement Statement Detail data).

My question is two- or several-fold:

What causes the volumes in the two columns to be different for the G type?  I could find no discernable value to make it change anywhere in the data.
Which column has the values that the ISO uses in determining the total net position for EPMI?
Why don't the two sets of volumes match (IE to Settlement)?

I really need to understand this, as we are required to tie all of our customer's volumes back to the Settlement Statement file, and, again, when the backup file doesn't match or is inconsistent, that makes our goals that much harder to achieve.

Caroline

s Bar Date

IMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September 5=
th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO =
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them i=
n part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an =
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the underscheduli=
ng penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the underscheduling penal=
ty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are several rehearing petit=
ions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty, to date the ISO has cal=
culated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing pursuant to the undersch=
eduling penalty.  It is our expectation that Scheduling Coordinators will s=
hare with individual entities for whom they schedule, information that is r=
elevant to them.
As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles transa=
ctions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized nor =
in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market Participant=
s in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of "ISO Debtors" against=
 "ISO Creditors" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further, while the ISO may =
be asked by an "ISO Debtor" to assert such claims in the PX or PG&E bankrup=
tcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will decline any such reques=
t.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any Market Participant's c=
laims, whether or not the Market Participant files any such proofs of claim=
 in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings.  Further, as we have advised in =
prior Market Notices, all statements, including the information sent today =
regarding the underscheduling penalty, are subject to change.  A number of =
transactions are currently known to be the subject of disputes and market r=
eruns.  There are also proceedings pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and Sta=
te Courts, the outcomes of which may affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Ma=
rket Participant or by the Market Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anti=
cipate that further disputes and proceedings may arise and market reruns ma=
y be performed that will affect the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO w=
ill continue to work diligently to resolve these matters as quickly as poss=
ible.  Nonetheless, it is clear that significant issues may remain unresolv=
ed and/or unidentified by the claims bar date.
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their resp=
ective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX and P=
G&E.

Kit,
	Sorry about not being able to get back with you on the PX issue yesterday. I will be wrapped up today until this afternoon. Give the Dan or Clark a call and have them walk you through this invoice, the number are listed at the bottom of the second e-mail. Find out where the PX short pay is encompassed in the account summary(about 9 million dollars). Once you walk through this with them, give me a call on my cell and lets discuss before we comment back to the lawyers. Sorry about having to pass the buck, but they have Murray and I scrambling. Call me on my cell if you need any further guidance.

Enclosed is your updated Account Activity Statement summarizing all accounts receivable/payables activities with CalPX occurring during 2001 starting with the issuance of the December Day-Ahead/Day-Of Market invoice back in January through the April Real Time invoices in August.
The April billing cycles are adjustments being made by CAISO that go back as far as Spring 2000.  CAISO is continuing to make these adjustments, which are basically meter corrections and approved scheduling coordinator disputes, for prior periods.  These will probably continue for a few more months because of the recent FERC ruling regarding refunds.

On May 16, FERC rejected the ISO's proposed Amendment 38, which would have suspended the penalty.  FERC said it would look at the issue later.

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve

Hey bud,
	I am now officially out of VM and working on the EES mess. I will give you details later, but in a nut shell I will be spending a lot of time in Houston over the next 6-mths. Looks like I will be working with Richter on try to sort out the issues that we currently are having w/ EES.  Did you get a house yet? Also, set up the MSN IM so we can talk.

Chris:
This is further to our conversation in the afternoon.
I am doing a project to value real time power consumption information. Currently the forecast is done based on old data and there is a variance between the forecast, the load block purchased and the actual power consumption. The variance between actual and the forecast  entails penalties. I would like to know more about the structure of penalty and the amount being paid in Californai by EES where it serves physical power. Some of the questions that I have is:
How is penalty determined.
Are their other expenses apart from penalty that is levied on EES for the variance.
Any other information in this context that can help in the valuation.
What are other things involved in the settlement process that can help in determining the value of real-time information.
I would like to meet with you to discuss this further.
Regards,
Rajat Khater

Hi Chris,	
	
	I wanted to check on California Energy Resouces Scheduling - the piece they disputed paying us in February.  Virginia had in DMS that you are handling this now. So, to refresh your memory, they did not pay us $186,000 in February - broken down as follows:

Deal #533136.1  2/1/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/2/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/3/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/5/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/6/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw = $37,200

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So they are saying these weren't theirs until the 7th.

Thus my accounts receiveable shows that we have been shorted $186,000.  I need to know if I can collect this from them or if we will change the deals so that they will not be charged for the above days they are disputing.  I really need to get this fixed as soon as possible - since this shows possible exposure to us if we can't collect or DPR to the West if we have to remove these deals for the above days.

Let me know if you have any questions and let me know what info. you have.

Thanks!
Amy

Chris, I am hoping you can give me a little more information on the problems
that occurred for Trade Day April 9, 2001.  There is a post final dispute
being processed, and I am a little confused on the problem EPMI had when
processing and submitting this data.

What I understand is that the data for all zones was submitted with null
values, however, we have two versions in our system, the first was received
on June 8, and the second version was received on August 9.  For all of your
demand zones, PGE1-4, SCE, and SDG1, there are no differences in the two
versions of data submitted.  

Please look into this as soon as you can.  It is important that we have
accurate and correct data for your Post final dispute.  If you have any
questions please don't hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks.

This is the gentleman we discussed several weeks ago from EBS who understands the "old" EES system set-up very well.  He worked with John Henderson (New Power), Anoush Farhangi (New Power), Vivian Hart (EES- IT), and others in the establishment of several databases (e.g., Pub DB) and systems applications when EES was first getting started.  He might be a great candidate to help transition EES systems into the established EWS systems you prefer as an end solution.
Michael

FYI:  The word is that HR has a moratorium of some sort on placing former EBS staff with IT.  That's why this guy is now available -- he wants some options.

Subject:	RE: Request Escalation for MV90 Interval Data Project


I need a timeline of the request, and what has been going on for the past couple of weeks related to this.  When was the request made?  When did CSC receive it?  What have they done with it?  I know this was discussed several business days back.
I don't have a problem with the approval for the emergency request AFTER someone explains why we have had a delay.

Steve and Bob, please work with me Monday morning as
soon as possible to do whatever we need to do to escalate the status of
this
request to the highest response level possible.  Help me get the approval and forms needed to initiate work on this project on Monday.
If we need to meet with the requesters, please advise.

          Subject:	MV90 Interval Data

I am trying to help some people in our team to obtain a
data download from MV90 of all interval usages on a daily
basis.  This has been a big issue with our traders in
the California market.  They have been trying to get this information
to get better Schedule numbers for power usages.
John Rutledge from IT had filled a work request for CSC
to start this work, but according to CSC, for this to be approved
as an emergency request you have to approve it.  This is
a high priority request for the traders.  CSC can start on this
Monday first thing and start giving us samples.
Please approve this request as an emergency request.
Attached is the work request and I've asked Richard Miller to
help escalate this also.
Thanks.

John-
I have attached a copy of the Work Request for this
effort. Please review
it to be sure that it accurately reflects your need.
Everywhere on the form where you find 3 questions marks
(???), you need to
supply the data. If there is no information to be filled
in, feel free to
leave the field blank. The only fields that are REQUIRED
are the fields for
Lead requestor (the person who can answer questions
related to this
request), the Alternate requestor (someone who can
answer questions in the
lead's absence) and the Business sponsor (the person who
can authorize
spending for this effort if it approved-must be VP level or above)
When you have filled in those fields, please forward
this form to Jackie
Jackson (jjackson@enron.com) for submission to CSC in
Dublin. (They are
aware of this request, but need the official request from Enron.)
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Chris-
To clarify what I meant regarding prioritization:
CSC handles multiple, often independent, requests from
ENA as well as EES,
many
of which are of the "we need this as soon as possible"
variety. What they
want
from us (not just EES, but Enron as a whole) is a
prioritization of *all*
of
these outstanding requests, not just what our group
might have asked of
them.
Sorry about the confusion,
* John

Steve-
Here's a quick synopsis of what we need:
Users want actual historical metered data. If they
can't get the data
before
it has been EEV'd (?) by MV-90, they need to know,
for each value,
whether it
is the actual metered amount or an estimated value.
Users understand that there may be missing data, but
do not require the
meta-data detailing this. However, this is with the
understanding that
the
back-fill data will eventually arrive at some later date.
We want any account- and meter-descriptive data as
well as the
associated
volumetric data.
A  test file to see what kind of data are available
and a few
consecutive
days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed.
If data is received from 12 - 6 a.m., how soon after
6 a.m. can we get a
file?
Please do not "burn in" this process just yet because
data and timing
requirements may change.

Chris-
With the bullets above, Steve has promised to turn
around the completed WIP
by
COB today or tomorrow morning. Hopefully this will at
least get the ball
rolling. It is then up to the business to determine
whether to proceed and
how
to prioritze it. There must be concerted effort from the
business to
prioritize
requests to CSC. Steve gave me Richard Miller's name as
the EES coordinator
for
these requests. Please contact him and let me know what you find out.
Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for
filling these things
out
and keeping track of them. I've heard different things
from different
people,

and I don't want to end up (nor should anyone else)
being the person who
fields
random and anonymous lobs from the other side of the fence.
Cheers,

--John

I doubled checked this with Stacey but I wanted to let you know that it is not Enron Works Operations dep't policy to provide cell phones to all employees unless they are in some type of supervisory or managerial and above position. These cell phones are strictly for business use and for emergencies related to work. This policy also applies to all the East risk group as well.  It seems to me that some things are done differently here when compared to the Houston office and if you feel that it is a necessity for you to have a company cell phone by all means talk to Tim about getting a cell phone under his department. Obviously, if you do use a cell phone for business purposes then the applicable charges can be expensed. 

Sorry guys, I don't make the rules, I only tell you about them.

Chris:
This is further to our conversation in the afternoon.
I am doing a project to value real time power consumption information. Currently the forecast is done based on old data and there is a variance between the forecast, the load block purchased and the actual power consumption. The variance between actual and the forecast  entails penalties. I would like to know more about the structure of penalty and the amount being paid in Californai by EES where it serves physical power. Some of the questions that I have is:
How is penalty determined.
Are their other expenses apart from penalty that is levied on EES for the variance.
Any other information in this context that can help in the valuation.
What are other things involved in the settlement process that can help in determining the value of real-time information.
I would like to meet with you to discuss this further.

Update time. What is the latest on the job hunt? Since talking w/ you I have seen so many articles coming out on how difficult it is for the recent grads to find employment. I was hoping that I could be of more help to you, but Enron is long people right now. I do feel like I can be of some help by year-end, but I realize that doesn't help you rt now. I am spending pretty much every week in Houston until year end trying to get one of our internal units sorted out.  Maybe we can try to hook up one weekend in Houston, if not, I will see before the year is out.

				PS. Rachel is coming in to town this month and she wants to make sure she gets a chance to see you. I will find out exact dates and send them to you.

At the

    (3) "See, the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis, and
only enough blood to run one at a time."   - Robin Williams

    (4) "If a woman has to choose between catching a fly ball and saving an
infant's life, she will choose to save the infant's life without even
considering if there is a man on base."  - Dave Barry

    (5) "What do people mean when they say the computer went down on them?"
-Marilyn Pittman

    (6) "Relationships are hard. It's like a full time job, and we should
treat it like one. If your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to leave you, they
should give you two weeks' notice. There should be severance pay, and before
they leave you, they should have to find you a temp."   -   Bob Ettinger

    (7) "My Mom said she learned how to swim when someone took her out in
the lake and threw her off the boat.  I said, 'Mom, they weren't trying to

York said, 'Gee, I'm enjoying the crime and the poverty, but it just isn't

John,

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

Chris, Michael--

I've been looking at some of the MV-90 files from CSC. Here's what I have found:

There are 1200 to 1400 meters reported each day. We will need to keep an eye on this number to see what kind of growth to expect.
Almost all meters report in 15 minute intervals. Interestingly enough, one meter (UCSF CUP 3), started reporting 5 minute intervals on 6 August, and has done so ever since.
The current prototype application I am using to read this data into a temporary database reads about 1meter per second, so I am averaging around 20 minutes per file. While I think I can improve the speed of this process, it does not take into account the need to map this data to the correlating account data, so any gains may be lost there.
Although some of the datafiles are complete (4 readings per hour X 24 hours X every meter) others are missing quite a lot of data. ("9 missing readings for meter KZ+029402367...87 missing readings for meter KZ+029402370...15 missing readings for meter KZ+029402392...") I will work with CSC next week to figure out what is causing this extreme variance in the dependability of the data from day to day.

Next week I will be looking into MDMA to match up these meter ids with accounts. I will let you know what I find.

In accordance with FERC

?s April 6, 2001 Order Dismissing Rehearing, Accepting
Compliance Filing and Directing the Recalculation of Lower Wholesale Rates,
CalPX has implemented the $150 breakpoint detailed in FERC?s December 15, 2000
order.  CalPX has included an adjustment amount on the January 2001 Day-Ahead
and Day-of invoices reflecting the breakpoint implementation.  In summary, CalPX
calculated the Day-of and Day-Ahead market settlements and Block Forward
settlements as usual, and included an adjustment amount that took into account
congestion, bid prices, overscheduling, and block forward contracts.  These
adjustments are detailed in new forward market products created specifically for
the adjustments (see new product list below).  The attached file provides a
further explanation of the method used. Also attached are the CalPX filing
requesting guidance and FERC's response. The January Forward market invoice,
price cap adjustments, and CTS invoices are scheduled to be released May 8,
2001.

Godfrey Hyde will be handling all of Audrey's old accounts with the exception of the California ISO and its related customers, such as those below, that are handled outside of the Enpower/Unify systems.
I will be training our new coordinator, Sharon Fredrick, on the ISO process and she will be responsible for this portion until Audrey's return.  Please ensure that all communication regarding the ISO is sent to both Sharon and myself.

Please join me in welcoming Sharon to the group, and feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Subject:	Final Actualization - September 2000 ISO

Godfrey,

The final actualizations for Preliminary and Final Settlements are available and can be found in the following Flash file:

M:\Electric\CALISO ACTUALIZATION\Actual\2000\Final\0900 Settlements Final ISO 042701.xls

The following customers have been paid an initial amount, and are owed the additional amount as shown:



You will note that Snohomish was overpaid, and owes us a refund in the amount of $1,591.06; the remaining amounts are balances owed to the customer.   I can find no record of an initial payment to El Paso (EPE), but the Flash report reflects a payment owed to them.  Other customers reflected in the Flash are handled in a different manner and we need to talk about those (CRC, DELANO, HARBOR, Willamette, etc.).  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions about this data, or the details in the Flash file, as well as to discuss the special-handling customers.

Please set up these payments to go out as quickly as possible, and let me know the expected payment date.

Thanks,

Caroline

Subject:	MSAP meeting

Regarding the meeting on Tuesday - MSAP is the system interface between Stat, Lodestar, HP, and Altra with SAP.  Currently we have a contractor monitoring the payment request files against the CSC electronic files, looking for duplicate payments, and sending the files to SAP.  He also manages issues that come up with CSC.  EES IT is in the process of moving the interface to a SQL server and should be done soon.  Since our IT is taking over the system aspects, we need someone permanent to take over the business aspects.  Mary Lynne and I were talking about the business functions that go along with monitoring this interface and think it has alot of settlement aspects, which might fit into Murray's world.  This meeting is just to talk about the responsibilities, where we think the best place is for it to reside and the transition.

Also, could you please add the associated charge codes to the description. Then go back and audit the document by cross checking the number of ISO charge types vs. what you have been given in the document. The final document should have all charge types that the ISO currently has in place.

Subject:	WIP for MV-90 data

Steve--

Here's a quick synopsis of what we need:

Users want actual historical metered data. If they can't get the data before it has been EEV'd (?) by MV-90, they need to know, for each value, whether it is the actual metered amount or an estimated value.
Users understand that there may be missing data, but do not require the meta-data detailing this. However, this is with the understanding that the back-fill data will eventually arrive at some later date.
We want any account- and meter-descriptive data as well as the associated volumetric data.
A  test file to see what kind of data are available and a few consecutive days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed.
If data is received from 12 - 6 a.m., how soon after 6 a.m. can we get a file?

Please do not "burn in" this process just yet because data and timing requirements may change.


Chris--

With the bullets above, Steve has promised to turn around the completed WIP by COB today or tomorrow morning. Hopefully this will at least get the ball rolling. It is then up to the business to determine whether to proceed and how to prioritze it. There must be concerted effort from the business to prioritize requests to CSC. Steve gave me Richard Miller's name as the EES coordinator for these requests. Please contact him and let me know what you find out.

Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for filling these things out and keeping track of them. I've heard different things from different people, and I don't want to end up (nor should anyone else) being the person who fields random and anonymous lobs from the other side of the fence.

Cheers,

--John

EWS Business Contact - Richard Miller
Deal Capture Status - Information is not included on any CSC power deal tickets (deal sheets)
Risk Book Status - Currently not captured - A.K. Matheson is researching and will provide details

Gas

EWS Business Contact - Lisa McClendon
Deal Capture Status - Information is included on CSC gas deal tickets (deal sheets)
Risk Book Status - Currently captured
Billing Status - CSC does know which customers bands apply to - currently applying bands to some gas customer bills, but process performed manually
	==>  Lisa has been working with CSC this week to determine the following -
		- How many gas deals do bands apply to?
		- How is CSC tracking penalties by meter and by billing period?
		- What is total $ amount of penalties?
		- What is the estimated unbilled penalty amount and what is CSC's plan to resolve on a go-forward basis?

I will forward additional information as it becomes available.

Chris,

Thank you for your response.  We have relief from customer on the 9/28 deadline - new deadline is one-week after we receive the information from customer.

Lamar - This is the UCSF situation we discussed last night.  I suggest those copied on this e-mail have a conference call to discuss Chris' questions.  

Gracie - Since you are in touch with Lamar while he serves his civic duty and know his schedule, could you arrange the call?  Thank you.

Kimberly,
	I am more than happy to get this issue resolved, however, this is the first that I have heard about getting a number to the customer by EOB 9/28/01.Here are some of the questions that I have regarding this deal:
						1) What index are we settling this contract at. I see that you have both a 10-min Dec price along with an hourly price in the spreadsheet that you sent me. My 
						     is that it would be settled at the Dec since that is what the ISO pays at, but I need confirmation that the customer has agreed to this index.
						2) Are the prices you have in your spreadsheet settlement quality since the ISO does not publish any changes to their web site that happen after 96hrs.
						3) What method are we using to confirm the customers usage other than him sending us a file.
						4) When can we expect to get the usage data for Feb.-July
						5) Are these spreadsheets the detail behind what was invoiced to the customer.
						6) Do you have a copy of the latest contract with this customer that gives the calculation language appropriate to their over-generation.
 
   I will get this turned around for you as soon a possible once we get the details ironed out on the process. I understand your urgency in wanting to get this settled as soon as possible and I will make sure that happens going forward. However, I will need your patience on getting this settled for Aug. since I have yet to find a documented process for the proper settlement of this contract. Please free to give me a call if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

										             Thanks

Subject:	Cogen Credit Calculations


We currently have a customer in California, UC/CSU, with a cogen plant at the University of California San Francisco campus.  Per their contract, they are owed a monthly credit for their excess energy i.e. energy sold back to the grid.

Due to the return to bundled service, and the chaos which ensued, needless to say, this credit calculation fell through the cracks.  The credit calculation has not been done since January 2001.  The customer is now very anxious for that amount.

We have agreed to give him an amount (not the check) by EOB tomorrow, 9/28.  Since the only volumetric data which the customer has provided so far is for August, we only need to provide that months credit amount.

Per our conversation, here is his August interval data.  I've also attached a sample of what has been done in the past.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

There seems to have been some confusion on pricing.  I believe that Chris was going to provide the pricing to John, and we have not seen that yet this week.

Do we need to set up another conference call since Chris could not attend the last one?  Please advise.

Tom:

I talked to Dave Bohler at UCSF Friday regarding the cogen calculation and completion of his business invoices.

I told him to expect it to take at least a week for us to complete our cogen calculations after we received the files from PG&E.
His expectations are that we should have calculations completed by Friday, Oct. 12.

Several weeks ago Dave requested the BI's to be complete by Friday, Oct. 5. I explained that I talked with our billing group (Kimberly), and it would take until Oct. 12 to get the BI's complete.

He is fine with both items. Dave said he appreciated the update, and that his main concern is that he is notified in advance if we can't meet a date we have committed to. 

Kimberly:  

?	Does the group in Houston have all the information from the PG&E files they received to complete the cogen calculation?
?	Please let me know ASAP if there is anything that will delay us from completing both items by Friday, Oct. 12.

Thanks,

Debbie

	Have you heard anything back on the time in which they sink up MV90 and MDMA. Also, were you able to find out the password to get into MV90 just in case we have  to go straight to the source. Thanks again for all of your help on these issues.

Here is the data model and data flow diagram for MDMA.  

 << File: MDMA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.ppt >>  << File: MV 90 data Model.ER1 >> 

I am trying to find out if the data from MV90 get interfaced into MDMA on a daily basis
or not.  If it is done on a daily basis, then I don't think there is a need to go into MV90.
MV90 will have raw data and will not have gone through validations which are performed
in MDMA.

Geiv,
	From the discussion that I just had with Pam, this does not seem to be clearly the case. She will do further research and see if there is an issue with Ibook, but you need to give some examples of how you came to such a clear conclusion.  This is something that should have been done some time ago. What I expect is that you and Pam will work together to come up with an efficient solution. It was also brought to my attention that you want to minimize the time you spend on this process, I would agree with that. I have given Pam the same instructions so I would expect to see this process  finely tuned in very near future.

I appreciate your concern in this matter, and I fully agree that its imperative for me to enter deals accurately. I admit that I have made a few errors, however, it is clear to me that the real issue  is the fact that the program that Pam uses to query deal tracker is innacurate. The majority of "mistakes" are just instances where IBOOK does not pull accurately from dealtracker. I have talked to Pam about this and I wanted to keep you in the loop.

Feel free to call me at 5-2877 if you have any questions.

Geiv,
	Just curious, who do you think has time to go over the mistakes that you may have made in these spreadsheets? For the time being, Pam will take care of this process for you. In return, you will be given a 24hr timeline to get all discrepancies answered and cleaned up in Deal Tracker. I feel this is a fair timeline since Pam is the person doing the leg work to identify all discrepancies. If you have any questions or suggestion on this process, feel free to call me at 56120.

I wanted to get w/ Steve Fisher to discuss the gathering of the different types of contracts that we spoke about in yesterdays meeting. As for the 1:00, I wanted to go over the fields needed to calculate the consumption bands. How much time do you have at 1:00, maybe we can consolidate these meeting and go over all of the fields with Steve and Glenn in the room.

what is the subject of the four o'clock - are we only talking about the consumption bands or all the fields in general.  I was wondering if it would be good for Glenn to hear their process.

Chris and Murray,

Here is the embedded generation curve vs current day wholesale prices through March - 02.  We cannot break down what the generation cost is by primary, secondary, and transmission.  Hope this is helpful.

Chris,

Here's something to get you started.  Included is the original work request, #1692, which was our initial request for data from them.  It has been trimmed down somewhat so that we could get something within the timeframe we wanted.  Their latest response is in the ROM file.  The file "Ranger0712.zip" has the latest presentation given to us by CSC regarding this project.

This email is to summarize how i think we are going to book the LA AS transactions so as to ensure smooth settlements and month end.  Whoever intiates the deal will put in two enpower transactions:

Transaction One:  This one represents ENA buying AS from LA at the agreed upon capacity price and volume

Transaction Two:  This one represents ENA selling AS to EES at an agreed upon price and volume (Once Bill finishes his assessment of work he will work with Neil to determine what fee is appropriate  - this fee will be embedded in the price he sells to EES).

Lastly any time the AS gets exercised Bill's group will put the energy in caps and enpower.

If you have any questions or comments on the process let me know.

Stewart

Not good, I will let you pick the appropriate excuse for why I haven't gotten it done. I will not be able to get it to until Friday if that is ok for your timelines. Sorry to be a hold up.

Todd,
	I apologize for not getting back w/ you in a more timely manner. As far as tracking a deal through the system, we have made very little progress. I have been pulled off on a couple of other projects that were deemed to be of higher priority. I talked to Chris Leonard last week to see if he could be of some help in tracking this down for us since he knows the Risk systems very well. He agreed, and I will follow up w/ him to day on what his approach will be.

This is the item that we talked about in last week's Project Ranger meeting, and agreed needed to put on the high priority list.

Subject:	RE: FW: CSC UPDATE

Chris,

In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  

Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  

I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. 

The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Maurice

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

	How amazing that this is exactly what we agreed to this morning. You then apparently decided to put yourself back into the process and schedule a meeting that I did not agree to attend. I made it very clear that it would be difficult for me to attend a meeting today, but that I could try to break free for 2:30. I then thought that it would be on ME not yourself to schedule this meeting if I was able to break lose from my meeting by 2:30.I left my schedule open most of last week in order to resolve this issue. However, we never got a response from Steve to allow us to close this item. Before any phone call takes place to Steve tomorrow, you and I will talk about the handling of this item going forward. Please stop by at your earliest convenience so that we can put this issue to rest.

     I am ok with the  most of the Audit plan except for the date of
completion. August 2001 seems quite excessive since we now have one SQMD
audit under our belts. Please provide to me the logic behind the thought
that this Audit will take over 3mths to complete.

Ken,
	Murray is going to take a look at the responses before his 10:30 meeting at which time I will forward those over to you. Also, I am going to have Patti set up a time for you and I to meet on Thursday.

Ken,

	First of all, sorry for the mix up last week that is all on me. As far as the comment on the SQMD, Murray wants to take a look at the responses which should happen this morning or early afternoon. I would also like to schedule some time this week to sit down and talk about some questions that I have about the audit that fall outside of my responses. Once again I  apologize for the delay and I will have something to you ASAP.

Chris,
No problem.  Just trying to verify your/Murray's schedule.  We will need to spend a fair amount of time together, as we previously discussed.  I want to ensure you guys are aware of everything and we have thoroughly thought through the issues, how they are worded, what the corrective actions are, etc.  So, we will need time to go through in detail, re-draft, review again, etc. until we are all confident we have a good product.

With that in mind, you are in Houston the week Labor Day (Tue - Fri??, I would guess?), what about the weeks of 8/27,  9/10 and 9/17?  We are still receiving a few last details/wrap-up on the draft, as you know.  We could review with you before it is totally completed, but the more complete the better.

Just glancing at my schedule, it looks like next week and the week of Labor Day are already quite full, so the week of 9/10 may be best.  We can jointly make the call when I hear back from you.

Thanks.

Yea, me giving up what is with that. So I got to go out like a punk and you went down in a blaze of glory, beautiful. How is everything going in the wonderful PacifiCorp world? Did you ever settle into a specific job or do still move around. Risk group seems to be doing better, they even get to get off early one day a week. I am pretty much spending all of my time in Houston working on the EES project, kinda sucks s far as the travel goes. I don't know if you heard, but we lost Sean could lose more at year end when all of the contracts come to duration.

Subject:	El Paso Dec Calif. PX Shortfall - never received

The Following invoice was sent in February to collect for the California PX Shortfall - entered as an annuity Deal #508664.1

 << File: El Paso Invoice for shortfall.xls >> 

El Paso should have paid $889,898.71 to Enron atleast by the 2/5/01 (since invoice was sent on Feb 2nd to be paid on receipt).

As of 5/8/01, they are 93 days late.

According to their WSPP contract the interest rate is 1% per month prorated until paid.

El Paso needs to then pay the original $889,898.71 + $27,208.65 in interest.(see below for calculation of interest)
		1% x 12 months = interest for a year = 12%
		12% / 365 days = interest for a day   = .0329%
	          .0329% x 93days    = proration of interest for 2/5-5/8 = 3.0575%
	$889,898.71 x 3.0575%   = interest due to Enron for late pay = $27,208.65	

Let me know if I need to call my contact at El Paso about this late payment or if you want to call her.  In case you do, it's Kathy Peterson (915) 543-2039.

Then,  let me know whether you want me to send an invoice for the interest.  Either way I need to collect the $889,898.71 - since it's sitting on my Accounts Receiveable - flagged as past due. - so just let me know what I need to do and how you want to handle this.

Thanks so much and let me know if you need anymore information. - Amy

I made some changes to the requirements after meeting with Rogers yesterday.  I plan to send this out to IT today - of course, that does not mean this is set in stone.  Let me know if you want me to wait and/or if you have any changes to incorporate.

Also, here is my first cut at the intramonth deal entry screen (part of short-term solution hooked into RPS).  Let me know if you have any comments/questions.

Chris,

I left a message on you answering machine last Thursday at 4:36 p.m. (PST)
regarding higher loads noticed in PGE territory. I'm sending this email n
case you're out for a period of time.

I basically just noticed that load had risen above observed normal levels in
July for EPMISCE1, EPMIPGE1, EPMIPGE2, and EPMIPGE3. I was wondering if you
knew why this was happening? On my phone message I also indicted that I had
seen schedules going up as well and assumed that you may be picking up new
customers.

Thank you,

Chris,

The issue here is whether the CalPX or California Energy Resources Schedule=
r ("CERS") owes us $186,000 for the power we delivered to the CalPX from Fe=
bruary 1st through 6 under our block forward contracts.=09=09=09=09=09=09

The State of California, i.e., CERS, is responsible for payment of this pow=
er.  It is true that we scheduled the block forwards through the Cal PX on =
Feb. 1-6, and that we did not schedule this power through CERS until Februa=
ry 6 (delivery on the 7th).  But Governor Davis issued Emergency Orders D-2=
0-01 and D-21-01 on January 31st.  Under these Orders, the So. Cal. Edison =
and PG&E block forward contracts were "hereby commandeered by the State of =
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State =
of California."  The Orders were effective "immediately."  Because the Orde=
rs was effective on January 31st, the State had title to the contracts from=
 January 31st forward.  Section 8572 of the California Emergency Services A=
ct authorizes the Governor to commandeer private property, but requires the=
 State to pay the "reasonable value thereof."  Therefore, since the State o=
f California had legal title to the contracts and the power supplied under =
those contracts on February 1st, the State of California---through CERS---i=
s responsible for paying for power delivered on February 1st, and forward. =
=20

Responsibility for payment falls on the party with title to the power, not =
the party responsible for scheduling the power.  Just because the CalPX con=
tinued to schedule power for a few days while CERS got its act together doe=
s not mean that the PX was responsible for payment.  Once California took t=
itle to the power,---and all the benefits of having the power---it also ass=
umed responsibility for payment.=20

I would be happy to explain this to CERS, if you want.  Let me know.

Hi Chris,=09
=09
=09I wanted to check on California Energy Resouces Scheduling - the piece t=
hey disputed paying us in February.  Virginia had in DMS that you are handl=
ing this now. So, to refresh your memory, they did not pay us $186,000 in F=
ebruary - broken down as follows:

Deal #533136.1  2/1/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/2/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/3/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/5/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/6/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So t=
hey are saying these weren't theirs until the 7th.

Thus my accounts receiveable shows that we have been shorted $186,000.  I n=
eed to know if I can collect this from them or if we will change the deals =
so that they will not be charged for the above days they are disputing.  I =
really need to get this fixed as soon as possible - since this shows possib=

Chris, 
thanks for sending these files promptly.  However, there are a couple of zones and hours I need you the check in the EES file as the volume look a little inconsistent when compared to hours before and hours after. 


Please check the following:

4/4		PGE1		11, 13 & 17
		PGE2		11
		PGE3		11&12
		SCE1		1, 11 - 17

4/5		PGE2		2-5

4/11		PGE2		2-6
		PGE3		2-6 & 24

Kimberly,
	I am more than happy to get this issue resolved, however, this is the first that I have heard about getting a number to the customer by EOB 9/28/01.Here are some of the questions that I have regarding this deal:
						1) What index are we settling this contract at. I see that you have both a 10-min Dec price along with an hourly price in the spreadsheet that you sent me. My 
						     is that it would be settled at the Dec since that is what the ISO pays at, but I need confirmation that the customer has agreed to this index.
						2) Are the prices you have in your spreadsheet settlement quality since the ISO does not publish any changes to their web site that happen after 96hrs.
						3) What method are we using to confirm the customers usage other than him sending us a file.
						4) When can we expect to get the usage data for Feb.-July
						5) Are these spreadsheets the detail behind what was invoiced to the customer.
						6) Do you have a copy of the latest contract with this customer that gives the calculation language appropriate to their over-generation.
 
   I will get this turned around for you as soon a possible once we get the details ironed out on the process. I understand your urgency in wanting to get this settled as soon as possible and I will make sure that happens going forward. However, I will need your patience on getting this settled for Aug. since I have yet to find a documented process for the proper settlement of this contract. Please free to give me a call if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

										             Thanks

Subject:	Cogen Credit Calculations


We currently have a customer in California, UC/CSU, with a cogen plant at the University of California San Francisco campus.  Per their contract, they are owed a monthly credit for their excess energy i.e. energy sold back to the grid.

Due to the return to bundled service, and the chaos which ensued, needless to say, this credit calculation fell through the cracks.  The credit calculation has not been done since January 2001.  The customer is now very anxious for that amount.

We have agreed to give him an amount (not the check) by EOB tomorrow, 9/28.  Since the only volumetric data which the customer has provided so far is for August, we only need to provide that months credit amount.

Per our conversation, here is his August interval data.  I've also attached a sample of what has been done in the past.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Chris--

I guess you must be in Portland--I left a voice mail for you yesterday.

Anyway, I don't know exactly who here at Enron is responsible for representing our priorities for these matters to CSC. I talked to Geoff Goodfellow in Dublin and he suggested Bob Gresh or Brenda Herod. These are names I've seen in the recent barrage of emails, but I have not met either of them and don't know their exact involvement in all of this. I have also asked Geoff to confirm that, assuming this process was elevated to the highest priority, we could be getting the data around 7:30 a.m.

The database you mentioned is definitely not "ready to go." The meter data we're getting from the MV-90 system is just that: a list of meter numbers and readings.  I am assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that just having a database of meters without their associated sites, account, clients, etc. isn't going to be useful to anyone. I am working on putting something very basic together to show Michael Frazier sometime early next week. I will also get back to you on the file-processing time once I've run a few tests.

Let's get together and iron out some of the specifics of what *you* need from this data. I'm free all day tomorrow.

--John

John,

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

Subject:	CES2423 Project Proposal

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

--John

Diane,

	Jeff Richter has put me on task to resolve the issue that we currently have in trying to get meter data from CSC in a timely matter. Michael Frazier mentioned that you had sent a proposal to Jeff, and that you were waiting on him to review it and give you a sign off to go forward on your proposal. However, when I spoke w/ Jeff last night he had not yet received your proposal. Could you please forward your proposal to myself and Murray O'Neil so we can get up to speed as to what our option are in resolving this issue.

Enclosed is your updated Account Activity Statement summarizing all accounts receivable/payables activities with CalPX occurring during 2001 starting with the issuance of the December Day-Ahead/Day-Of Market invoice back in January through the April Real Time invoices in August.
The April billing cycles are adjustments being made by CAISO that go back as far as Spring 2000.  CAISO is continuing to make these adjustments, which are basically meter corrections and approved scheduling coordinator disputes, for prior periods.  These will probably continue for a few more months because of the recent FERC ruling regarding refunds.
Please feel free to call Don Deach (626-685-9876), Rachel Axelrad (626-685-9843) or Clark Cheng (626-685-9846) with any questions.

Subject:	CES2423 Project Proposal

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

Melissa,
	The payments that we need to send out to these counter parties are listed below. These payments are being made based off of our estimates for both the month of Nov. and Dec. The Nov. payment is being calculated at 23 cents on a dollar (Due to the ISO short-pay) while the Dec. payment is dollar for dollar.  We will then actualize both Nov. and Dec before the close of the May accounting month. Please give me call if you have any questions on this topic.

	The document below should be a starting point for our discussion this afternoon. I should give you a pretty good idea of the variables we are trying to capture in the Deal Ticket. I will be speaking w/ Steve Walker this afternoon to flush this all out in  greater detail. If you have any question please call me at 503-807-8959.

FYI?

I left Mark a message today indicating that I was not comfortable that they were capturing all of the different parameters associated with Baseline and Bandwidth on our current contracts correctly.  My biggest concern here is that we need to make sure that CSC who is doing our billing is reflecting the same information.  There needs to be an action items which I thought was started two weeks ago to ensure that everything which is needed by CSC on the Deal Ticket is captured by us on our deal tickets so we can on populate a deal ticket once.  The ultimate would be that we have more on our deal ticket then CSC needs and they can pull just their relative elements.

Brenda,
	Operations have for some time communicated the consumption excess and deficiency charges to CSC on the deal request form in the comments section. They have also indicated the method of calculation. We strongly suspect that these are not being charged correctly and as a result Barry VanDerHoarst and I am currently running an investigation of 10 randomly selected deals to check the CSC pricing calculations. Please let me know who in your group should be involved with this initiative. We have been capturing this information on our deal tracker now for the past two weeks for both power and gas.

Subject:	RE: consumption band confirm

AK,

Thanks for the voicemail yesterday.  This is what I need confirmation on:

Power - Are the consumption bands being captured on the del sheets?  Are they being communicated to CSC for invoicing purposes?  If they are being captured and communicated, what day did this start?  It had to be within the last week.  If they are not being captured and communicated to CSC, it needs to start ASAP and I would like confirmation of the official start day.

Gas - It is my understanding that they are being captured on the deal sheets and in the Risk books.  I have confirmed that CSC is billing over/ undertakes.  I just want to make sure that the deal sheets, when consolidated with the customer/new deal set-up with CSC, continues to capture that information.

Thanks for your help.

This is what I know.

The DASH definitely captures the consumption band.  As I understand it, a consumption risk book is not up and running.  I believe Mallik's intention is to have in running by the end of the year.

If you need anything else come see me.

Mariano:
In your review of the following contracts, is the DASH capturing the consumption band and is this structured into the risk books?


Pac Bell
Home Depot	
Sysco
EOP
Pepsi
 "Medge Industries"

Please advise.
Thanks.

Richard,
	This is the last e-mail that I got from Mr. Gresch. As you can see, I am asking if this has been escalated to something other than the normal process. From the conversation we just had, I guess the level of priority never made it's way to you. While I am not sure who dropped the ball on this item, the fact remains that it was dropped and another week of information that is crucial to the intramonth book was missed. From this point forward, I would like to know who I should be talking with when it comes to these types of issues so as to avoid this miscommunication in the future.

Bob,
	I am a little confused, my understanding was that you would be able to escalate these items to get a quick turnaround time in comparison to going the normal process. What you are recommending sounds like the normal process, am I incorrect on that conclusion?  When can I expect to get feedback from CSC with the process listed below?

John/Chris - I spoke to Steve Walker with Team Enron this morning about your request.  He'll be contacting you to help fill out the request form and get it submitted.  When the request is completed, it should be forwarded to Jacqueline Jackson in my group for submission to CSC.  With respect to your time for completion requirements, we'll need to work with CSC on prioritization if there are any issues.

Betty,

	Stewart has asked that I send you an e-mail giving you the logic behind  the way in which EPMI arrived at the CDWR payments for December as they relate to the PX index.  EPMI made a payment for December sales to all of our Scheduling Coordinator clients equal to approximately 78% of what they would have received according to the PX hourly index.  This is the approximate methodology that the  PX  used in making its payments to their customers. If you have any questions in regards to this issue, feel free to call me at 503-464-8219.

Chris, I am hoping you can give me a little more information on the problems
that occurred for Trade Day April 9, 2001.  There is a post final dispute
being processed, and I am a little confused on the problem EPMI had when
processing and submitting this data.

What I understand is that the data for all zones was submitted with null
values, however, we have two versions in our system, the first was received
on June 8, and the second version was received on August 9.  For all of your
demand zones, PGE1-4, SCE, and SDG1, there are no differences in the two
versions of data submitted.  

Please look into this as soon as you can.  It is important that we have
accurate and correct data for your Post final dispute.  If you have any
questions please don't hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks.

To:=09ISO Market Participants
Subject:=09CAISO Notice - Cash Allocation Policies

ISO Market Participants:
Since Trade Month November 2000 (which settled beginning in January 2001), =
payment defaults in the ISO markets have caused the ISO to pay less than th=
e full amount due Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) in the monthly cash clearin=
g process.  The purpose of this message is to describe the ISO's policies a=
nd procedures in settling the market when defaults occur.  As set forth in =
Section SABP 6.7.4 of the ISO Tariff, when payment defaults occur from SCs =
that have obligations to the ISO's markets (Debtor SCs), the shortfall is t=
o be prorated to SCs with net amounts due them (Creditor SCs) based on thei=
r outstanding balances. The principles that drive how amounts are settled a=
nd defaults are allocated to Creditor SCs are summarized below:
Proportionate allocation of defaults - The total amount of market defaults =
is allocated to the Creditor SCs on a proportionate basis such that each Cr=
editor SC receives the same percentage of their total net amount receivable=
 for the month.  SCs are allowed to net the credits and debits on a monthly=
 basis as described below.  The intent of the Tariff is to equitably distri=
bute market shortfalls only to those SCs that have net market receivables f=
or the period. =20
Each month is treated as a whole period - Final and preliminary invoices ar=
e combined when possible (see exception conditions below) in allocating mar=
ket defaults.  Cash payments from the market are received in two stages (pr=
eliminary and final).  At preliminary, market payments are distributed base=
d on the preliminary amounts due to the Creditor SCs as set forth in the pr=
eliminary invoices. Final invoices serve essentially as true-ups to the pre=
liminary invoices, and accordingly, payments received at final are redistri=
buted to the extent possible to achieve true-up allocations for the whole m=
onth considering the combined amounts due the Creditor SCs from both the pr=
eliminary and final invoices.
Each month is treated as a discrete period - Market defaults are generally =
allocated to the Creditor SCs that have amounts due for the month being set=
tled.  The exceptions to this rule involve (1) SCs that are Creditor SCs in=
 the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods o=
r (2) Debtor SCs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for=
 prior months.  In the first instance, the Creditor SC would not be paid to=
 the extent of default obligations from prior months.  Amounts due to the C=
reditor SC would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds =
would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period. I=
n the second instance the current month's payment is carried back and appli=
ed first to the oldest outstanding balance. The proceeds would be distribut=
ed to the Creditor SCs for that earlier period based on the Creditor SCs un=
paid balances in that month.  With respect to the carry back of payments to=
 the earliest period, Pre and Post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from d=
ifferent SCs.
GMC defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments  - GMC is =
billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final invoic=
es each month.  In the event of payment default on any GMC invoices (at eit=
her preliminary or final), market funds are transferred to satisfy GMC obli=
gations before any market distributions are made.  This first priority posi=
tion for GMC revenues is set forth in Section SABP 6.3.1.3 of the ISO Tarif=
f.  Therefore, when both GMC and market defaults occur (as has occurred in =
each of the past few months), the Creditor SCs have two reductions to the m=
arket clearing amounts ultimately paid - an allocated portion of the GMC de=
fault, and an allocated portion of the market default.  RMR invoices and pa=
yments are not affected by market or GMC defaults - The RMR invoicing proce=
ss involves amounts due from the PTO's to the RMR Owners as set forth in mo=
nthly invoices processed through the ISO's systems.  However, such amounts =
are invoiced independent of the ISO's market and GMC billing processes, and=
 accordingly, market and/or GMC defaults do not impact RMR related payments=
.=20
There are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of alloca=
ting cash to Creditor SCs when defaults occur.  Some of these factors inclu=
de:
* amounts received after payment date deadlines - such amounts are typicall=
y included in the next distribution
* market payments due to Creditor SCs that default on GMC in the current mo=
nth - such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount of the GMC=
 default by the Creditor SC
* allocations to prior months - not made unless the amount exceeds
0.5% of that months billed amounts
* small invoices under $5,000 are paid in full rather than the allocated pe=
rcentage.
For more information about these allocation issues or any other related mat=
ters, please contact Melodie Iverson (916) 351-2174 (e-mail mkiverson@caiso=
.com <mailto:miverson@caiso.com> ) or Mike Epstein (916) 351-2314 (e-mail m=

Audrey,

Here are the Income Statements I've created using Courtney's data to pay Willamette. I'll be gone on vacation this afternoon thru Monday. 
Willamette is getting upset that we haven't settled for 6 months after the power flowed. I need to get them paid for these months this week if possible.

Les

Mechelle,
              I  should have an answer today on the month that had the greatest number of resubmittals to the ISO. What are the dates that the ISO is showing for the greatest UFE inpact? Also, I will try and set up a time later in the week that Murray O'neil and myself can come by to get an update on the audit.

This is the gentleman we discussed several weeks ago from EBS who understands the "old" EES system set-up very well.  He worked with John Henderson (New Power), Anoush Farhangi (New Power), Vivian Hart (EES- IT), and others in the establishment of several databases (e.g., Pub DB) and systems applications when EES was first getting started.  He might be a great candidate to help transition EES systems into the established EWS systems you prefer as an end solution.
Michael

FYI:  The word is that HR has a moratorium of some sort on placing former EBS staff with IT.  That's why this guy is now available -- he wants some options.

Chris and Murray,

Here is the embedded generation curve vs current day wholesale prices through March - 02.  We cannot break down what the generation cost is by primary, secondary, and transmission.  Hope this is helpful.

I confirmed that since Enron does not deviate from their schedules in real
time a good portion of the payments have been going to Enron.  It is still
up in the air what they will do with these charges.

John,

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

Subject:	CES2423 Project Proposal

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

--John

Pam -

I am your Hour-Ahead, or Real Time, contact. I've attached all of my contact information below. You can also find this information attached to the EES Hourly sheet I send you each day.

Kysa is your Day-Ahead contact. Her phone number is 503-464-7486.

If you can tell me more specifically a) what kind of problems you're running into with the CARP report and our sheets, and b) whether the problems are related to the EES Daily sheet (which outlines day-ahead deals) or the EES Hourly sheet (which outlines real time deals), then I can be of more assistance. As I said in my last e-mail, I've gone over all the variances you've sent, and none appear to be related to hourly deals. I've also attached the reconciliation model I maintain each day so you can see how I've tied out Enpower to the hourly model for every day in September.

Please let me know if I can do anything else to help.

Thanks,

In STAT, they mean the following:

     Active - delivering commodity, billing has begun
     Submitted - the account has been DASR'ed, commodity is flowing, no
bill has been sent from the UDC
     Cancelled - the account never became active
     Closed - the account is no longer flowing commodity, last invoice has
been sent
     Deactive - the account has been sent to the utility to close, last
invoice has not been sent
     Pending - account is waiting for installation of a meter to being
flowing commodity

(Pam did I get all these correct?)

I just talked to the developer and the MV90 and MDMA data sinks up daily.  The previous day's
read should be available in MDMA the next day.  I haven't asked for a logon and password to get
into MV90 because I am not sure you would want the data from MV90.  From my understanding,
MV90 will hold the raw usage and it does not get validated for high low checks or other errors until it gets to MDMA.

If the previous day's data is sufficient then MDMA should be good enough.

Let me know if you still need me to pursue further.

I left Mark a message today indicating that I was not comfortable that they were capturing all of the different parameters associated with Baseline and Bandwidth on our current contracts correctly.  My biggest concern here is that we need to make sure that CSC who is doing our billing is reflecting the same information.  There needs to be an action items which I thought was started two weeks ago to ensure that everything which is needed by CSC on the Deal Ticket is captured by us on our deal tickets so we can on populate a deal ticket once.  The ultimate would be that we have more on our deal ticket then CSC needs and they can pull just their relative elements.

	Operations have for some time communicated the consumption excess and deficiency charges to CSC on the deal request form in the comments section. They have also indicated the method of calculation. We strongly suspect that these are not being charged correctly and as a result Barry VanDerHoarst and I am currently running an investigation of 10 randomly selected deals to check the CSC pricing calculations. Please let me know who in your group should be involved with this initiative. We have been capturing this information on our deal tracker now for the past two weeks for both power and gas.

Subject:	RE: consumption band confirm

AK,

Thanks for the voicemail yesterday.  This is what I need confirmation on:

Power - Are the consumption bands being captured on the del sheets?  Are they being communicated to CSC for invoicing purposes?  If they are being captured and communicated, what day did this start?  It had to be within the last week.  If they are not being captured and communicated to CSC, it needs to start ASAP and I would like confirmation of the official start day.

Gas - It is my understanding that they are being captured on the deal sheets and in the Risk books.  I have confirmed that CSC is billing over/ undertakes.  I just want to make sure that the deal sheets, when consolidated with the customer/new deal set-up with CSC, continues to capture that information.

Thanks for your help.

This is what I know.

The DASH definitely captures the consumption band.  As I understand it, a consumption risk book is not up and running.  I believe Mallik's intention is to have in running by the end of the year.

If you need anything else come see me.

In your review of the following contracts, is the DASH capturing the consumption band and is this structured into the risk books?


Pac Bell
Home Depot	
Sysco
EOP
Pepsi
 "Medge Industries"

Please advise.
Thanks.

Betty,

	Stewart has asked that I send you an e-mail giving you the logic behind  the way in which EPMI arrived at the CDWR payments for December as they relate to the PX index.  EPMI made a payment for December sales to all of our Scheduling Coordinator clients equal to approximately 78% of what they would have received according to the PX hourly index.  This is the approximate methodology that the  PX  used in making its payments to their customers. If you have any questions in regards to this issue, feel free to call me at 503-464-8219.

George,
	Questions:
1)	What DA and RT Excel reports are you referencing in the e-mail below? The only report that my group currently sends out is the ISO HA Final which comes from Jim Reyes. 
2)	Who are the contacts that are sending you these reports and what are the timelines in which you receive these reports after the date of physical flow.
3)	Please send me and example of both the reports and the discrepancies that you have encountered along w/ your process for booking the information given in the reports.

I think that you are probably referring to the reports that Kate Symes and the R-T group send out, but I don't want to jump to that conclusion without you confirming that to be true. Any information you can give me on the process will be helpful in coming up w/ a solution to the issues that you are running into. 


									Thanks

Chris, 

Recently, the Excel files for the DA and RT markets that are sent to populate EES DealTracker, do not tie to the EnPower file sent to us later.  This has caused all parties increased  investigation time and could cause potential delays in the booking of accruals. Recently,  the scenario is occuring more frequently.   I wanted to bring this matter to your attention now to avoid any delays.   Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide to make the process smoother.  If you have any questions, please contact me.  -George

She said that she would not be available to meet formally until Monday due to the declared disaster at their operations due to the flood.  She said they are moving back to the Pennzoil building today and Friday, so things should be close to normal by Monday.

Pat said that it is not be a problem to export the MV90 data (in just about any format) on a daily basis for us.  The data is housed in MV90 databases which , according to Pat, can only be read by an MV90 system; so we would need to purchase MV90 (very expensive) if we wanted to read the data directly.  

I suggest we get the data exported daily from CSC to an FTP site at Enron, because they can manage the process on a daily basis.  We can sweep the FTP site daily and have it automatically imported into our databases.

If we are in agreement with this solution, I  will create an emergency work request with CSC to begin working on this immediately.

Hey, I was just thinking about you and Kristian yesterday. I never see you on the IM anymore, do you still have access to it? Spending most every week in Houston is getting old, but I think we may finally be making some progress. Family is doing great when I see them  and I will evaluate my situation at year-end. How is your job going and is Kristian going to remain in the fold. I think things have finally gotten much better in Risk, so that is a very good thing. You and Kritian pop on IM sometime so we can chat.

Hello Everyone,

Over the past week Debra Davidson and I have been discussing how to operate EWS from the administrative aspect since we have individuals from multiple groups within ENA.  As of today, I would like everyone's travel, expense reports, cell phones, and/or any other administrative needs to go through the following people.

Beverly Filer is your Houston Administrative Assistant.  She is dedicated to providing EWS excellent administrative support while you are in Houston.  This includes preparing your expense reports, arranging meetings, powerpoint presentations, etc.  Beverly's phone number in Houston is 713/345-3134.

Jill Chatterton is your Portland Administrative Assistant .  She is dedicated to providing our EWS group excellent administrative support, whether you are in Portland or Houston.  This includes preparing your expense reports, providing support with cell phones, arranging meetings, making travel arrangements, etc.  Jill's phone number in Portland is 503/464-8216.

Please contact Jill and/or Beverly for ALL of your administrative assistant needs and refrain from asking your previous assistant for support.  Using Jill and Beverly as our assistants will mean they will have more information about our organization which will make them more effective for all of us.  If you have any questions, please contact me.

Attached is the TX market diagram and tentative answers (in red) to the settlement questions posed below.  

 << File: TXMarketDiagram.xls >>  << File: TXPreston730.doc >> 

Also, regarding the question posed earlier today,  Marty Sullivan 214-875-2636 (Enron's TXU representative) is checking to see if the information you requested is public and available.  TXU considers industrial customers to be >1 MW.  He informed me that on September 1st customer information will be released to marketers.  There is a possibility that by sorting through this information, you can identify the industrial customers in the TXU service territory.

Please call me with any questions.

While cautious of the issues we face, I'm very encouraged by your experience and your willingness to help. 

I tried to summarize the issues discussed in the meeting this afternoon in the attached report. Please let me know if I've erroneously attributed your name to an issue. 

Don't pay much attention to the Scenario at the bottom of the report. I haven't spent much time on it. 

 << File: ERCOT Physical Delivery Process.doc >> 

We will continue to fill in the blanks (and probably add issues) over the next few months. 

My short term goal is to identify the vast majority of the issues and have a plan of action related to those issues within the next week. 

Any feedback you have is welcome.

Melissa,
	The payments that we need to send out to these counter parties are listed below. These payments are being made based off of our estimates for both the month of Nov. and Dec. The Nov. payment is being calculated at 23 cents on a dollar (Due to the ISO short-pay) while the Dec. payment is dollar for dollar.  We will then actualize both Nov. and Dec before the close of the May accounting month. Please give me call if you have any questions on this topic.

I agree with the content of John's e-mail except for the pricing delivery date. I will not have the pricing completed until sometime late Monday night. I am in flight to Houston until 2:00CST, at which point I will be in meeting until late Monday evening. I looked at the queries this weekend, so it should not take long to put the necessary fixes in place.  Everyone on this e-mail will have the pricing information in their e-mail when they walk in on Tuesday morning. I apologize if I did not make that clear during our phone conversation. Also, I would like to have a discussion at some point on how we will handle this customer going forward. My thanks to John for taking the time to clarify my concerns.

Subject:	UCSF Update

After speaking with Chris this afternoon I believe the status of the UCSF pricing to be as follows:

1.  Chris examined the volumetric data and the pricing information this morning and determined that there was clearly an error that needs to be resolved.  It is this error that prevented Chris from delivering a price at the conference call this morning.

2.  Given the billing errors that we believe have made in computing the January 2000 - January 2001 payments, Chris does not want to compound these errors by giving UCSF a price for February 2001 - August 2001 based on information that he has determined to be incorrect.

3.  Chris can deliver pricing for February 2001 - August 2001 on Monday afternoon but he would like to do with the understanding that this price is to be used solely for internal purposes.  If it is necessary to deliver a price to UCSF at Tuesday's meeting, Chris requests that we make it clear that Tuesday's price is a preliminary price.  We will need to obtain actualized data from the California ISO before giving UCSF a definitive price.

I hope this helps everyone.  Unless I hear otherwise I will speak with each of you at 1:30 PST/3:30 CST Monday afternoon.  Chris, I apologize in advance if I have in any way misinterpreted our phone call this afternoon.

Paul will be out of the office for the next week so don't feel pressured to do it right away.   I will try to give you a call.

Kristian,

	I met with Tim today to inform him of my intentions to pursue opportunities outside of the Portland office. It seem to go very well, w/ TIm also saying that he had expressed an interest in working in London. He did make sure and state that the London office is the highest cost office in all of Enron, and therefore would probably be the first on to experience layoffs if the economy took a downturn. His thought is that he wants to see if he can get me into something on the floor by mid year, but would support me if I decide to go elsewhere. The tougher issue is going to be telling Murray of my intentions. What do I do now to start truly pursuing a job in the London office?

		         The room was full of pregnant women and their partners, and the Lamaze class  was in full swing.   The instructor was teaching the women how  to breathe properly, along with informing the men how to give the  necessary assurances at this stage of the plan.   The  instructor then announced, "Ladies, exercise is good for you.  Walking is especially beneficial. And, gentlemen, it wouldn't hurt  you to take the time to go walking with your partner!"   The  room really got quiet. Finally, a man in the middle of the group  raised his hand. "Yes?" replied the instructor.   "Is it all  right if she carries a golf bag while we walk?"

Subject:	Re: CDWR/CERS   

In order to continue settlements on a weekly basis - I feel we are going to have to have that in writing - them agreeing to it; because just today someone from CERS called to confirm that we got our last payment from them and to say "goodbye & thanks" since I would no longer be calling her with 7 day settlements since that ends March 31st.  So #1 I need to know that we have relayed it to the correct people there before I forecast money coming in again weekly.  Also, I need to see what all deals should be included - because in March there was both a buy & sale that was checkedout with CDWR and paid according to WSPP.  We had the 7 day settlements deal under CDWR when it probably should have been under CERS - since that is who was on the confirm for the 7 day settlement.  

Let me know & I'll run some CARPs to see what I see so far for April.

Thanks and I hope to be of help! - Amy

Amy,
	I would like to continue settling CERS/CDWR on a weekly basis until both Legal and Credit are comfortable with moving them to standard settlement time lines. Thanks for your help on this issue.

I received CERS/CDWR's last of the 7 day settlements payments on Friday - on time.  
Let me know if there is anything else I can do.  Otherwise, I will return to settling "normally" with them.

Thank you

Bob,
	I am a little confused, my understanding was that you would be able to escalate these items to get a quick turnaround time in comparison to going the normal process. What you are recommending sounds like the normal process, am I incorrect on that conclusion?  When can I expect to get feedback from CSC with the process listed below?

John/Chris - I spoke to Steve Walker with Team Enron this morning about your request.  He'll be contacting you to help fill out the request form and get it submitted.  When the request is completed, it should be forwarded to Jacqueline Jackson in my group for submission to CSC.  With respect to your time for completion requirements, we'll need to work with CSC on prioritization if there are any issues.

Caroline, 
	
	While I agree with you that having you go to Houston would be productive, it is a luxury that we cannot afford. We are currently four and a half months behind on our actualization process, with both the internal and external customers running out of patience. With also have Brett leaving this Friday and Donna out until next week, I need you to focus solely on getting us actualized for the months in question. We also have a deliverable to Seattle City Light by the end of this week. Until we get these items settled, I can not allow the transition of duties between yourself and Virginia to take place as we had planned. We all want this transition to happen, but we have to get these deliverables out the door.  I hope that you can understand that with all of these issues on the VM plate, my answer will have to be no to your going to Houston.

Chris,

I understand that Virginia has been approached to head down to Houston and meet with the Settlements group.  I would like to be part of that as well, if that is alright.  There are still some things they do on their side that I would like to learn about, and I think that Virginia and I could collaborate on a sharing of information meeting and both would get a lot out of it.

Let me know.  I guess the date hasn't been settled, yet, but I am available pretty much any time in the next few weeks.

Jeff / Chris,

Well, I think the corp housing saga is finally completed!  

On 10/3/01, your belongings will be moved, free of charge, from Apt.# 4140 to Apt# 2307 in Mid Town Square.  The apartment is on the third floor, corner lot, w/ a slight view.  It is a 2 bed/2 bath and should be comparable to where you are now.  The rate should be $107 / day.  The apt is leased for three months until 12/31/01.  

Denise of Ex Lodging, will be calling you, Chris, to make arrangements for the key and garage door opener drop off.  I gave her your email address. I have the signed contract agreement which I will hand over to Jill when she returns from vacation. 

Jill:  I dealt w/ Denise at Ex Lodging. She can be reached at 713) 552-9852 x111.  They made a specific notation in the file that only you or Debra Davidson are authorized to make changes / cancel / modify the lodging agreement.  Come by my desk when you get back in town and I download the whole story.

Thanks, guys, and again, you've been great thru a frustrating experience!

Julie K

Chris,

The issue here is whether the CalPX or California Energy Resources Schedule=
r ("CERS") owes us $186,000 for the power we delivered to the CalPX from Fe=
bruary 1st through 6 under our block forward contracts.=09=09=09=09=09=09

The State of California, i.e., CERS, is responsible for payment of this pow=
er.  It is true that we scheduled the block forwards through the Cal PX on =
Feb. 1-6, and that we did not schedule this power through CERS until Februa=
ry 6 (delivery on the 7th).  But Governor Davis issued Emergency Orders D-2=
0-01 and D-21-01 on January 31st.  Under these Orders, the So. Cal. Edison =
and PG&E block forward contracts were "hereby commandeered by the State of =
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State =
of California."  The Orders were effective "immediately."  Because the Orde=
rs was effective on January 31st, the State had title to the contracts from=
 January 31st forward.  Section 8572 of the California Emergency Services A=
ct authorizes the Governor to commandeer private property, but requires the=
 State to pay the "reasonable value thereof."  Therefore, since the State o=
f California had legal title to the contracts and the power supplied under =
those contracts on February 1st, the State of California---through CERS---i=
s responsible for paying for power delivered on February 1st, and forward. =

Hi Chris,=09

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So t=

Subject:	Site Profile / Consumption Issues in our contracts


Chris,

As a follow up of our conversation, here is a summary of contract issues. I have tried to organize my comments into three major categories: baseline, bands and material change language.

Where Contracts were prior to Site Profile Desk took control

Baseline: Not specified in contracts! A variety of mechanisms to build baseline post-contract including:
Calculating volumes on a forward basis, i.e first 12 months
Last 12 months prior to contract closing
Baseline volumes that grow by x%
Bands: Annual 90/110 bands, Aggregation at all levels (including utility, state and national etc.)
Material Change Language: Varied, unclear or vague language (at least in my opinion)


Where we are now

Baseline: Two basic mechanisms intended to bring clarity
Major Transactions (i.e. any deal not priced from Matrix): volumes explicitly specified in contract
Minor transactions: last 12 months prior to contract closing (with the understanding that Origination will collect 12 bills required for booking within days of contract closing; process details to be finalized)
Bands: Monthly 90/110 bands, Aggregation allowed within same utility-voltage-facility type groupings
Material Change Language: Unfortunately still unclear and inadequate (see below for our proposals). For example, the 


Where we want to be

Baseline:
Minor transactions: A process needs to be in place in Services Department to collect the 12 bills required for booking within days of contract closing.

Material Change Language: This area needs to be really beefed up. In my opinion, material language should catch risks that are not explicitly modeled and priced. At the moment, I don't see material change language accomplishing this. 

Issue 1: Protecting for long term shifts in consumption

The 90/110 consumption bands (which are set on monthly basis) we are offering right now are intended to provide normal weather and operating flexibility. With this assumption, we currently price consumption risk as a probabilistic process as opposed to pricing using the classic straddle approach (simultaneous call & put).  Any "step" changes in consumption, such as The Limited adding additional display area or Tyco Health Care Products, adding new production shifts violate this assumption.  I propose either (1) adding language that captures this "steps" or (2) price these steps explicitly. Given the lack of quality actual data the second alternative would be an educated guess at this point.  Recently I proposed (verbally to be fair) the following language to Jim Wood (Products-Origination).

If a "Material Change" (defined below) has occurred, EESO or Customer may request that the commodity pricing be restructured to account for such Material Change.  A "Material Change" shall be any intentional or unintentional change, including energy efficiency upgrades, to the processes or operations conducted at any of the Facilities or other similar occurrences that:

(i)	change a Facility Account's consumption of electricity or natural gas at such Facility Account by more than 10% of the Facility Account's Consumption Baseline over any six consecutive months (i.e. Facility Account's Actual Consumption divided by Facility Account's Baseline Consumption equals less than 0.9 or more than 1.1), or 

(ii)	change a Facility Account' s monthly on-peak usage ratio for electricity at such Facility Account by more than 5% of Facility Account's monthly on-peak usage ratio baseline over any six consecutive months.  The Facility Account monthly on-peak usage ratio equals the monthly on-peak Facility Account usage divided by the total monthly Facility Account usage.

Jim's immediate reaction was mixed. He felt that customers may feel that we are giving them volumetric flexibility on one hand and taking it back with the other. He said 80/120 on material change may be more palatable.

Issue 2: Sudden Load Swings in Short Term

Although, the monthly bands protect us on monthly volume swings, they are not very effective in preventing sudden un-planned short term load swings triggering imbalance penalties. Here the language currently in contracts that is supposed to protect us against this risk:

Notice of Operational Changes.  You agree to promptly advise us of any event reasonably known to you that may impact energy usage at any Account (e.g., equipment installations, outages, shutdowns, repairs, openings or closings, changes in operating hours) by an amount (without regard to weather-related effects) greater than either (i) 25% of the Actual Usage for such Account during the same Billing Cycle in the prior year or (ii) 2 MW (each an "Operational Change").  If you fail to notify us of an Operational Change, you will reimburse us for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by you or us as a result of such Operational Change.  

This language has at least three problems:
No compensation mechanism specified if customer does not deliver on this requirement.
Is 25% and / or 2 MW justifiable, especially given the differences in imbalance treatment across physical markets?
No clear process (i.e. minimum time frame for notice, contact information) specified for customer to deliver this notice

I would modify this language to something like:

Notice of Operational Changes.  Customer agrees to advise EESI at least two days (48 hours) in advance to the contacts listed in Schedule ____ by fax or e-mail of any event that may impact energy demand at any of its Accounts (e.g., equipment installations, outages, shutdowns, repairs, openings or closings, changes in operating hours) by an amount greater than either (i) ___ % of the Hourly Load for such Account during the same hour in the prior year or (ii) 0.5 MW of demand (each an "Operational Change").  If such Customer fails to notify EESI of an Operational Change, Customer will reimburse EESI for any Energy Imbalance Charges incurred by the Customer or EESI as a result of such Operational Change.  The mechanism for penalty calculation is specified in Schedule ____.
Hope this helps.

Todd,
	Just another update on where we stand with the interval meter data. How is everything going in your world? I am getting a lot of projects thrown at me right now, so let me know if there is any deliverables that I owe you. I just want to make sure I am not letting anything slip through the cracks. Hope all is going well, I will try to stop by before I leave out of  Houston this week(Currently spending a lot of time in 3 Allen center).


			Ps   I thought you said our stock price would not go below $40. Did Ken and Jeff forget to check in with you before the big decision. J

Chris, Michael--

I've been looking at some of the MV-90 files from CSC. Here's what I have found:

There are 1200 to 1400 meters reported each day. We will need to keep an eye on this number to see what kind of growth to expect.
Almost all meters report in 15 minute intervals. Interestingly enough, one meter (UCSF CUP 3), started reporting 5 minute intervals on 6 August, and has done so ever since.
The current prototype application I am using to read this data into a temporary database reads about 1meter per second, so I am averaging around 20 minutes per file. While I think I can improve the speed of this process, it does not take into account the need to map this data to the correlating account data, so any gains may be lost there.
Although some of the datafiles are complete (4 readings per hour X 24 hours X every meter) others are missing quite a lot of data. ("9 missing readings for meter KZ+029402367...87 missing readings for meter KZ+029402370...15 missing readings for meter KZ+029402392...") I will work with CSC next week to figure out what is causing this extreme variance in the dependability of the data from day to day.

Next week I will be looking into MDMA to match up these meter ids with accounts. I will let you know what I find.

John,

	Could you tell me who I would speak to in order to find out the priorities that are pushing this process back to 11:00am? Also, how much time does it take you to get this file into the database once you receive the file from CSC? This is making the assumption that the database is configured and ready to go. What are you currently seeing in the way of missing data coming in from these files on a daily basis.

Have attached the project proposal as returned by CSC. I am also summarizing a discussion I had with Geoff Goodfellow of CSC:

Since CSC is using a third-party, packaged application to produce this file, they are limited in their ability to deliver exactly what we want (in the context of the 51 hour, $4,883.62 estimate).

We requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. For example, if they ran it today, for 7 August, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 Aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. Getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).

Also, the file is 26MB, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. Again, since this is an external application, I have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (Not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)

I have also been told that file delivery will occur between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. daily. This is because of current priorities, but even at the earliest, we won't be able to get it before 7:30 a.m. (Data is collected from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., the report run takes 1 hour 30 minutes, a file is produced at 7:30.)

Subject: RE: 90/110 Contracts
 
Murray,  Thanks for the info, and the ideas.  We will talk on Monday when you get into the office.
 
Terry, Evan and Mark,
 
I am trying to determine if EES customers have been invoiced in compliance with the contract anywhere there is language regarding consumption bands/ over/under takes.  There is at least one thought throughout the organization that penalties have never been invoiced if a customer's usage was outside of the contractual bands, such as 90/110.
 
Beth and I talked with CSC about this last week, and they told us the following.
 
Gas:
The Altra system handles the over-take (above 110) as another tier in the pricing to bill the penalties.  The invoice combines it into one line-item with the first tier so when it is booked to the general ledger it is not segregated.  They do provide the customer with a break-out independently.  For undertakes, the administration is manual.  Erich Evans, CSC Gas Supervisor, told us he was confident in that his staff is monitoring the bands and applying penalties as applicable.  He did tell us that in the past the Gas Desk has communicated to CSC that they did not want the penalties accessed for the undertakes.  He also said that customers have a tendancy to dispute the undertake penalties.
 
In the HP abd STAT systems, the efforts are also manual.  Once again, he is confident that his staff is administering the penalties.
 
The exception to this is two-fold.  First of all, when CSC acquired these systems and contracts (formerly the Enron Dublin/Access Energy deals) from EES in 1999, there was no review of the contracts to ensure the system had cpatured the terms correctly.  CSC simply continued to invoice as EES had.  For new deals entered into from their take-over in 1999, CSC actually received the contracts and interpreted them to capture the data in their systems.  This practice continued until 2001 when the "deal ticket" concept was introduced, pushing the burden to EES for the correct data capture.  The process was gradual, but CSC feels that by 5/01 that almost 100% of the deals were captured through the deal ticket process.  Therefore, there is exposure that the deal set-up within CSC's systems is not accurate and consequently, the bands are not being monitored for compliance. 
 
Second, since the deal ticket process was effective, CSC's administration of bands is reliant on communications from EES through the deal ticket. 
 
In either scenario, our deal clean-up team will reveal any inaccurate deals, and our historical clean-up team will be able to calculate the exposures.  CSC is providing a listing of billed penalties/disputed penalties by Friday, 8/10.
 
POWER:
CSC is aware of only one contract with this scenario.  
 
We do not believe this to be true, and need to locate some power contracts to follow through their systems.  I need your help with this.
 
Terry,  Can someone on the Phoenix team provide me with a listing of any contracts that the team has looked at with this contractual implications?
 
Evan,  Can your service managers also provide examples of contracts that they know have the contract language?
 
Mark,  As we discussed on Friday, I need your team to review the GNO contracts/invoices and let me know if they are monitoring this.
 
Please let me know ASAP on Monday when I can expect this info.  I will assign someone tomorrow to bird-dog this for me.  I need an answer, and a plan (if it is not being monitored) by Tuesday to determine EES's exposure.
 
I appreciate your help.

Brenda,  
In talking with Chris he was able to round up these newly signed deal customers as having the 90/110 band terms included in their contracts. (See customers in email from Chris)
In addition when checking with others in the EES organization regarding the old contracts he was told that most of the older contracts which have been in place from 1997 to current have the band terms included in them as well.  
I would think that our best bet is to get together with project Phoenix resources and see if we can get examples of contracts which are handled by each of the settlement resources we have. (CSC, Avista, Enron?)
Let me know if you wish for me to drive this forward or if you have it covered.  
FYI?I will be in Houston next week. 8/6 - 8/10.
Thanks - MO

Subject:  Meter Operations Update

Attached is a summary of the impacted areas and a current status of Meter
Operations due to Houston flooding:

Meter reading and posting of data - We are currently unable to read/post
interval data for California or Phoenix.  While the electricity has been
restored, phone lines are still inoperable meaning we are unable to read
phone or wireless meters.  Since the phone system to the building had
extensive water damage, we are not sure when the lines will be available.
Backup operations are being developed in Dublin but are not yet functional.

Settlements for EEMC - Files for EEMC have been posted through Sunday, the
10th, for day 41, April 30.  Day 41 files for 5/1 due Monday, the 11th, and
5/2 due today, the 12th, have not been produced.  We are unable to
communicate with our servers because of the phone outage and are therefore
unable to create the files remotely.  Through today we have been denied
access to  our building.  Our plan is to seek access on Wednesday at least
long enough to generate our files and submit them remotely using a laptop.

Settlements for EESO - Files for EESO have been posted through Sunday,
settlement file 4/30 for day 41.  We are able to generate settlement files
offsite and are working to submit Monday's 5/1 and Tuesday's 5/2 file by
midnight today.

My plan is to produce these daily updates until all of our operations are
back in place and on schedule.

Please contact me with any questions....pager 800.946.4646    pin# 1524013.

Pat,
	The files are checked by EPMI on a daily basis, however, nothing is done w/ these files until an explanation is sent as to why they are being resubmitted. In our process we need to be able to explain both the reason for the resubmital and the MW variance to the ISO.

Subject:	Settlement Update

All, since our last meeting, here's where we are
now........................

In summary, our late submissions for early March dates were due to missing
load profiles in our manually run estimation database.  Once the problem
was detected and corrected on 4/18, day 41 for 3/8 settlement, the process
began to generate and regenerate the files from 3/1 forward.

A second problem was detected on 5/1 that caused high loads for SCE in
settlement files 3/17-3/24.  The MDMA system, which generates the actual
usage settlement file was incorrectly updated from our STAT system causing
the MDMA system  to calculate incorrect settlement numbers for an incorrect
set of customers, primarily those customers in SCE which had rolled back to
bundled service.  These files were posted to sparky and are now being
corrected for resubmission to sparky.  The load differences will be sent to
you as the corrections are made.

Observations and changes to procedure:
We were unaware that sparky was not manually checked on a daily basis for
late postings.  We became aware of this on 5/7 when Chris called to find
our why all of the late files were sitting on sparky.  Going forward,
Chris, I will let you (all) know of any late submissions.  Do you (Chris)
need notification on all postings or just the ones that are after day 45?

We are  securing a full time settlement person who will be in a position to
detect problems at the time the file is generated and move more quickly
toward resolving problems.

Steve Walker is working with Mike Frazier on the request for account,
usage, etc. listing.

Update on MDMA system generated estimates:
Still testing - fine tuning the missing accounts selection; calculations
look good.  With all of the above interruptions, this has taken a bit of a
backseat during the past couple of weeks.

Give me a call, if you need more details or have questions.

Subject:	Meeting you would be interested in

I am forwarding emails relevant to the Team Ranger initiative from the time I became involved to the time the scope of the effort was limited.  My understanding from my notes and recollections and a discussion with Glen Matthys this morning is as follows:
*  Team Ranger is co-sponsored by Greg Young, Scott Mills, and Mary Lynn Ruffer.
*  Team Ranger's objective is to capture all the data necessary for Ruffer to provide flash reports to Mills on what should liquidated from the risk book  vs actual costs and revenues experienced; Young's involved because his Operations group provides the link to CSC's billing and invoicing systems.
*  Since I had been discussing my forecasting data needs and RPS tie-ins with Scott, he viewed this as an opportunity for the organization to gather more information than strictly needed to meet this objective and invited me to lobby for an expanded scope.
*  Clearly I was outvoted, since the subsequent scope was severely restricted to retrieving only the financial data that is readily available to CSC and which will enable flash report development quickly (for power only); an expanded scope would have compromised timely deliverables.
*  The system will pull down monthly data from STAT and LodeStar billing systems on a daily frequency (and will still provide some valuable information for me).
*  The data collected for Team Ranger will be housed in an Enron-controlled database (not CSC's), supposedly for easy access to Enron users.


Chris, this clearly falls in the realm we were discussing last night -- a limited scope "silo" initiative to solve a localized problem.  Like I said, I'm a culprit, too -- if no one else wants to provide the data I need, I'll pull it myself just as you counseled a month ago when we were struggling to get answers from CSC (via Operations). I admit you were right: we've gotten more data since then with access privileges than I could have wrangled out of requests to CSC in six months (despite California).

Let me know what else you need from me to facilitate your efforts.  Please keep me updated with what you learn and where we stand.  I'll do the same.

There is a meeting scheduled for Monday (see below) to discuss information that must be provided by CSC and Avista so that we can start tying out what is actually billed to what is in the Risk books.  This is a lot of the same information that I know you are trying to get your hands around.  If you are interested in attending, please do so.  If you are not available, give me some data points so that nothing is overlooked.  This will be the first of many "get togethers".  Evan Hughes and his group will be there to represent what we are currently getting from the outsource providers as well as what we are collecting internally.

Subject:	Re: A/R Accruals Mtg. - Reminder   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

After looking at this, a couple of thoughts:

Assuming that we will create a "global" repository that will support everyone's needs for all EES activity (purchases and sells)

	Internal as well as outsource data

Outsource data needs to be "Enronized" (consistent internal formatting of field values)

	We should be able to use the GCP/EES Settlement System cross reference mapping that is set up and maintained by Global Counterparty as a way to get 	to Enron's Global Counterparty number

This should be a daily feed

We will need the same information for payments

Additional information needed in the file:

EES Entity transacting Business
Commodity 			(e.g. power, gas)
Covered Service		(e.g. commodity, projects, AOPS)
Flow Begin Date
Flow End Date
Volume
Volume Frequency 		(e.g. daily, monthly, total for period)
Volume Status			(e.g. estimated, actual)
Price Type 			(e.g. Commodity, Tax, ...)
Rate Schedule 			(if applicable -e.g. Name of Utility Rate Class)
Rate Name 			(if applicable -e.g. IF-Transco/Z6 New York Restricted)
Pass Through Fee 		(Yes/No)
Price (Per Unit)/Rate  		(e.g. Per Unit $50.00 USD/MWH or Rate $100,000 USD)
Price Currency                                   (e.g. USD, CAD, etc.
Total Amount 			(Price * Volume)
Total Amount Currency		(e.g. USD, CAD, etc.

Joni -how different is the information in this file compared to what Mike Newlin is getting on a daily basis for the Credit Aggregation process.  Should what Mike is getting be coordinated with this process.  The one advantage that I can see now is the ability to get an aged open A/R Balance

Mary Lynne -is there any additional information from what you are having pulled now for reconciliation of prior months?

Michael -from your requirements that you are already discussing regarding volumes, is there anything else?

How different is this from the Tax Project extract that was discussed -can these efforts be consolidated?

I will have Christina schedule a meeting for further discussion.

As discussed in the subject meeting, Joni and I have been working with Patrick Cagney and CSC on defining a project to generate a daily extract file containing transactional invoice data with accounts receivable balances and collections.  Attached is the data item list as discussed with CSC for your information.  CSC has already submitted an impact statement for this work; however, if it would assist any of your efforts to use, expand, or modify this data extract, I believe it would be beneficial to discuss it before we move forward with this project.  Please let Patrick or myself know if you have any questions regarding this.

First, I'm sorry about the tardiness.  Attached is the file you sent me with data elements that are important in volume forecasting highlighted and copied into its own column, then supplemented with additional information that would be useful if available from the sources contemplated.  Note the color codes used in highlighting are yellow to denote necessary or essential and blue to mark elements that "would be nice or occasionally useful."  Thanks, Pat, for your help in compiling this list.

Murray -

Sorry for the delay.  We spent a lot of time this morning working with the
designer of the Gas solution.  We have a much better understanding of their
business case now, and of course the resultant IT solution.  This should
help us in attacking the Power issue.

Attached are the updated memo I sent yesterday, with a more detailed
description and an illustration of the data flow, and a new document with a
set of questions that we may use to steer our initial information gathering
sessions.  Please take a look at these and let me know if you have any
questions.

Annie and I will be meeting with Chris for more business case understanding
next week.  I look forward to this time, and will work with Randy Wilson to
post status to you by week-end.  Thanks.

Joshua,

Thanks for the document.  I am also a very visual person.  Can you
please forward me a data flow where I can see the sources of the
information and how they are tied together.  Don't spend a lot of time
on it. I am hoping that this has already been put together.

Thanks - MO

 << File: Enron-GasAccessDBArch-Aug2001-IRM.doc >> Murray -

As requested, I am attaching here a document describing the high-level
uses
of the MS Access Gas solution.  It also details the main table and the
primary key for all records therein.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Annie and I
have a
meeting planned with the developer of the Gas solution tomorrow at 9AM,
after which we are planning on working with Chris to identify some of
the
key data areas required for the Power solution.

Thanks.

I still want to get together with you guys, since I could use the good company these days. Let me know what works for you two and I will make sure and work around the date. 

		Ps. No Kerry, this does not mean that you get the option to bail on Kevin and I at the next scheduled date.

Sorry, but I have a previous engagement that slipped my mind.  We will
have to move this back a week.  Let's plan on October 25th.  Will this
work for everybody?

Well just wanted to drop you a line and say Happy Birthday.

Hope your hands heal soon.  I assume you haven't responded to my emails
because you probably broke both hands and can't type right now.

Ken,

	First of all, sorry for the mix up last week that is all on me. As far as the comment on the SQMD, Murray wants to take a look at the responses which should happen this morning or early afternoon. I would also like to schedule some time this week to sit down and talk about some questions that I have about the audit that fall outside of my responses. Once again I  apologize for the delay and I will have something to you ASAP.

Paige,
	It has been requested that I fly back to Portland sometime today, so I will not get a chance to meet with you this week. I have attached a document with a  list of the variables that I thought needed to be captured to settle a consumption band contract. Please take a look at this and give me your input. Thank you very much for your help on this item.
