Memo =20

Thanks very much for your memo Paul it is very helpful.  I attach below for=
=20
completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on=
=20
EnronOnline. =20
There are two remaining issues which require further thought:-

1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline. =
=20
For the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates=
=20
will be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection th=
e=20
initialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection=
=20
250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do=
=20
have some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneou=
se=20
changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much=
=20
better specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage=
=20
that many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we=
=20
will do when FX joins the system.

2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credi=

Subject: Credit Trading OnLine - Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me=
mo

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,=
=20
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA=
L=20
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries=
=20
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or=
=20
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed=
=20
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ=
s=20
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in=
=20
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms =
of=20
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely=
=20
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summar=
y=20
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa=
nt=20
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction=
=20
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus =
on=20
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to=
=20
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news=
=20
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo=
w=20
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, =
on=20
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely=
=20
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a=
=20
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk=
=20
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b=
e=20
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks=
=20
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t=
he=20
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t=
o=20
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in=
=20
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general=
=20
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under=
=20
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their=
=20
constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular=
ly=20
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure=
=20
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur=
=20
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ=
e=20
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o=
r=20
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US=
=20
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include=
=20
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the=
=20
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha=
t=20
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which=
=20
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali=
ty=20
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron=
=20
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o=
r=20
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will=
=20
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou=
t=20
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha=
t=20
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute=
=20
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the=
=20
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve=
=20
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear=
=20
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in=
=20
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be=
=20
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using =
a=20
"substantial professional effort" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein=
g=20
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad=
e=20
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this=
=20
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic=
=20
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi=
ng=20
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor=
y=20
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart=
y=20
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc=
e=20
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve=
r,=20
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law)=20

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und=
er=20
the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product=
=20
constitutes a "security" under US securities laws (please see attached=20
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of=
=20
securities to "accredited investors" which will allow us to deal with=20
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul=
d=20
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit=
y=20
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.

Mark 

We'll be finalising these this week over here with a view to implementing 
them among the credit trading group in London.

As discussed, it makes sense to have the same (or virtually the same) 
procedures in Houston to ensure that confidential information is handled 
uniformly for this purpose.

Please let me have your comments on the procedures (if any) by the end of the 
week, if possible.

Many thanks

Paul

PS I assume you're comfortable with S&C's work on the US GTCs whichare now 
almost finalised - I'll send through final versions

Will proceed cautiously...Paul and I are spending a good part of tomorrow 
together to work through a legal risk matrix for each of the jurisdictions.  
Let's touch base either then or Thursday to discuss next steps and timing to 
see S&C.  We are out on Friday and Monday.

Until we have determined a legal structure that works for this trading (e.g. 
Chinese walls, public vs. private reference credits, etc.) I would encourage 
caution in how far you go with specific names.  Once they are tainted, it may 
not be possible to cleanse the situation sufficiently to trade on them for 
some time.

When would you like to go to New York to meet with Sullivan & Cromwell?  Let 
me know and I will set something up.

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently 
distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review 
prior to going live.  The intent is to capture as much of the corporate 
credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal 
resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new 
mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have 
for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.  

This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading 
initiatives.  We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop 
as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on 
ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and 
customer base.

Ken

Further to my voice-mail and the notes below, my view is that an effective 
Chinese Wall would obviate the need to check on whether we are holding 
confidential info on a reference entity, but we'd appreciate your advice on 
this.  I suspect Bryan wants to be personally protected against insider 
dealing allegations which could otherwise arise, but please confirm.

Thanks

Any idea what Bryan plans to gain this way?  It's not clear to me that a hard 
wall solves our problems with RE approvals but that's because I don't know.  
Maybe Ken can shed some light on this.

hard Chinese wall for his trans-atlantic credit trading group.  In short, he 
wants to be behind one and apparently John Sherriff is comfortable with 
this.  I have therefore asked Ken Raisler to advise us on how to construct a 
Chinese Wall from a practicle, US perspective, with the intention of having 
Sanjev at Slaughters modify the "instruction kit", as necessary, to work 
under English law.  Given Ken's involvement on equity trading, he appears to 
be the right place to start.  There remains the possibility that when the 
traders see the procedures they will change their minds and wish to stick 
with the existing procedures you have seen.

This will not impact launch of credit trading online which, as advised, is 
still set for tomorrow.

Please let me have any thoughts on this.

Regards

Paul

Bryan - 

In fact, in order to get this first list of 200 or so on the 
non-transactional web page, we conducted only a very brief legal review in 
Houston - th full review takes much longer since it involves input from a 
variety of people.

I suggest choosing the reference credits for online trading from the already 
approved reference credits which appear on EnronCredit.com.  My recollection 
is that there currently is not a separate approval process from either a 
credit or legal perspective.  Let's review everything for EOL prior to the 
states getting to the office on Monday and get an email out with the list of 
reference credits.

New reference entities - as with any other new Products, should be submitted 
to the Product Control Group (Amita Gosalia).

The PCG will then be responsible for the text of the new Products and 
obtaining the necessary approvals.

However, in accordance with our discussions with Bryan, EnronOnline will be 
limited to 20 reference entities until after we have settled on the credit 
derivatives update/volume requirements, which may or may not feed into a 
phase 2 development of the EnronOnline site.

Will there be a different process for approving names as references on

Furthermore, you, Edmund, Tomas  and I need to establish a process fro 
regular and smooth approval of new reference names, a checklist if you will.

This will confirm our conversation today regarding which European 
jurisdictions are approved for trading credit derivatives:  the U.K., Sweden, 
Norway, Finland and Switzerland.

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and 
The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it 
may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Per our conversation, Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit 
derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.

Correct....our intent is to err on the side of conservatism with respect to 
pulling credits off the ok list and then put them back on as and when the 
legal and commercial due diligence suggests that it is prudent.  It is 
definately impractical to ask for specific consent from each reference credit 
as we can probably expect many of the consent docs to make it into the bin.  
I have drafted an initial notification letter and will forward for review 
tomorrow.   I think that it is so unlikely that cp's will sign and mail back 
a formal consent that we should consider delisting them instead of asking for 
consent.  If we are successful in building the business as a standard for 
price discovery and liquidity, companies will ask us to quote on them.  

Bradford is taking a final pass through the reference credits and I will 
forward the pared down list on asap.

Probably not my place to comment but I haven't seen anything from Bryan yet.  
We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if 
that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having 
spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to 
quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen 
the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it 
included people like TXU.

On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send 
them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make 
a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on 
paper?

Subject: Re: Consent  

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after 
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference 
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were 
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was 
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities 
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each 
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or 
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing 
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of 
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been 
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by 
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet 
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business 
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require 
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to 
make important judgment calls.

My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice 
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved 
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on 
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we 
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those 
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them 
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the 
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference 
Entities as soon as possible.

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that 
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small 
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies 
for the miscommunication.

Until we have determined a legal structure that works for this trading (e.g. 
Chinese walls, public vs. private reference credits, etc.) I would encourage 
caution in how far you go with specific names.  Once they are tainted, it may 
not be possible to cleanse the situation sufficiently to trade on them for 
some time.

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently 
distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review 
prior to going live.  The intent is to capture as much of the corporate 
credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal 
resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new 
mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have 
for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.  

This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading 
initiatives.  We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop 
as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on 
ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and 
customer base.

As per my voice-mail, here is a raft of GTCs including the US version.  The 
US version take on board S &C's comments, but obviously you will need to sign 
off on the US GTCs before we go live.  Grateful for any final comments asap

Many thanks and sorry its not much of a birthday gift (I'll make it up to

All proposed names have now been included and duplicates removed (I 
think).....DW/EC no changes for Europe so go with your list.  Let's 
coordinate on timing when you all get in.  All names new US names have been 
selected off of the Fortune 500 (non energy) where there is public debt and 
an investement grade rating. 

Please call me when you have a chance to look at them and let's discuss any 
concerns.

Thanks for your assistance.

As many of you are aware, we have been building capabilities to offer credit 
risk management products to our customers on a global basis with initial 
focus in Europe and North America.  We are now ready to move to the next 
level and begin offering bankruptcy swaps on specific energy and non energy 
names.  We anticipate officially launching the business on Wednesday, 23 
February with a Press Release and external website called EnronCredit.com. 

Prior to making the public announcement, we intend to send a letter to the 
respective CFO/Treasurer/Finance Director of the reference credits letting 
them know that we will begin making markets in bankruptcy swaps on their 
names.  We have worked with Enron's many origination groups to remove names 
of customers that are particularly sensitive or where we might have 
confidential information.  In anticipation of potential direct feedback to 
the account representatives of the referenced entities, please see the 
attached list of initial reference credits and have a look at the test 
version of the web site at test.enroncredit.com (at certain times during the 
test phase, the web site may not be available in all locations).  

If you have any questions or comments, please contact either me or  Bryan 
Seyfried who is leading the effort  at 44 020 7783 7907.

Thanks!

John

Dear Mark,

Hope you are well!

I've attached the confirmation for the EOL bankruptcy swaps where ENA will be 
the contracting entity.  I've followed the format of the online ENA swap 
confirm but kept the economics the same as for the European bankruptcy swap 
confirm.  Please let me know if you are happy with this.  

Thanks, Edmund.

The previously approved 6 include some that should not have been approved 
(e.g., London Electric) and have subsequently come off the list.  
Additionally, my recollection is that we agreed on 25 for EOL at the 
discussion in Houston.  Credit and Legal Europe have approved that there is 
only one list, either we can trade it or not.  I have yet to understand why 
this may not be true for legal in the states but if there is some difficulty 
in approving additional US credits for the launch, we can replace these with 
European names to get up to the full 25.  I am sure that Mark will be in 
contact with the office regardless of whether he is physically there or not.  
I will follow up first thing in the am Houston time.  If we cannot track down 
Taylor, I will call Haedicke directly.

I believe Mark Taylor is out of the office until Wednesday.

At this point, I believe there are 6 approved Reference Entities for 
EnronOnline.

We will add more up to the previously discussed 20 as approvals are received.

Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, 
and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes 
to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have 
marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small 
tidy-up changes as well.

I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes 
should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references 
to "the United States" in Section 11(B) should remain as references to "the 
United Kingdom" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.  Please let me know if 
this is unclear.

Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare 
amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local 
counsel.

Many thanks,

Edmund.

 We have not yet received (and I have checked with Dave) any information with 
regards to the due diligence completed in terms of how this runs through the 
EOL system - eg can Guest Users who will have no transaction status when they 
sign a PA see the numbers?  Do the PA and ETA work for Brankrupcty swaps in 
each of the jurisdictions will see the swaps?  How many of those 
jurisdictions .  These are the issues we are to deal with when you give us 
the due diligence work performed.    We only got the contract today.

I know you spoke to Mark Taylor and believe that you discuss  agreed on the 2 
weeks timing which I assume is why the 8th March appears.  But please let 
Dave know if you want to move the dates radically.  We are purely working on 
2 weeks from receiving the info as long as you think we'll get it 2 weeks 
before the 8th March then we should have no problems with the press release 
below.

Comments on questions
EnronOnline is not a 24 hour system
We don't give out data on numbers of customers on EOL (primarily as its only 
about 200).

All,

I have looked over the U.S. credit GTC and the long descriptions. I see we 
have decided to go with quarterly billing, rather than monthly. Will the 
payment/collections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office?

I didn't spot any problems with the long descriptions.

A few relatively minor comments on the GTC's - which you may or may not want 
to consider:

- Clause 2.(e) (i) (1) - Does this clause preclude us from doing business 
with banks or other financial institutions? Could we append: "with regard to 
the Transaction"?

- What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken? Does that constitute 
sufficient breach to terminate the contract? I'm thinking specifically about 
sleeving, which is perhaps covered by Clause 2(e)(ii)(1)? I still think that 
sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online 
trading of derivatives. If I were working for a third party, I'd immediately 
look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the 
Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own 
risk differently from Enron. If I were the Reference Entity in question, I'd 
consider:
 a) Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy - 
then do a Phoenix (in the UK at least)
 b) Buy a load of protection via sleeving, then take the Credit Derivatives 
to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives 
as collateral to increase my line of credit - I'm no expert, but I suspect 
there might be an interesting leverage effect here, which might actually 
cause a significant increase in Enron's risk exposure.
 c) Like (b), only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative 
with or without the need for sleeving - we probably need a restriction on 
this? (I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up 
front, but if I were a financial insitution, I'd quickly find a way around 
this limitation - Affiliates or Sleevers.

-  Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against 
sleeving by adding something to Clause 2, like: "It is not entering into a 
Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the 
party (or any Affiliate of such party) which is the Reference Entity in the 
Transaction".

- Should Def'n of "Contract Currency" be "Contractual Currency"? 
("Contractual" is also used in the Long Descriptions)

- Def'n of "Credit Product" - after "Entity", should we insert "which is"?

- Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as 
"Enron"? As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a 
context similar to that of an arbitrator, it seems a bit cheeky to then 
define ourselves as the arbitrator - would this be enforceable if we were in 
court?

I'm assuming the other GTC's are very similar to the U.S. one and I have not 
read them.


Dave

My understanding is that Bryan will be in Houston to present his strategy 
regarding credit trading for approval under an interim trading policy - 
signed off by Jeff and Rick.  Before making any recommendation to Jeff, Rick 
wants to be sure that the people on the list above are comfortable with the 
activity and will be willing to signoff on the approval.  Given that Bryan 
will be physically here, I am requesting that you E-mail your concurrence to 
me no later than tommorrow.  Otherwise RAC will not present to Jeff for 
approval.  
Thank you for your help in puttting this together and making it a success!

Dear Mark,

Hope all is well with you!

We had a productive meeting yesterday with Slaughter and May on the EOL 
credit products and we are looking to polish off the GTCs within the next 
day.  I think that Paul had sent you the latest drafts for your comments (I 
have attached them again below).  If you do have any comments on the docs we 
would be pleased to take them within the next day.  Similarly, I think that 
you had received a copy of the Confidentiality procedures from Sullivan and 
Cromwell - again if you have any comments on that we would be pleased to take 
them.

One additional point, about which we talked in some detail yesterday, relates 
to capacity of a counterparty to enter into the credit products.  We are 
looking into this in respect of the European counterparties.  In respect of 
North American counterparties, we don't know what procedures are currently in 
place to check capacity, but it is probably worth considering whether any 
additional capacity checks would need to be made.

Sorry for the deluge of demands (such is EOL!!).

Edmund.

As you may have heard, we are in the process of building a business to make 
markets in credit protection and are getting close to launching where we will 
quote both directions on many of the credits in our existing portfolio in 
addition to names in non-energy industries.  It is important from both a 
commercial and legal perspective to ensure that we do not have what could be 
considered a fiduciary responsibility with the credits that we are making 
prices on.  The initial set of reference credits has been sent to credit and 
legal for approval and then will be forwarded to origination for further 
approval before we initiate coverage.  Pls. take a look at the names and let 
us know if you have any problems with us quoting prices on them.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns

bryan

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently 
distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review 
prior to going live.  The intent is to capture as much of the corporate 
credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal 
resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new 
mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have 
for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.  

This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading 
initiatives.  We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop 
as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on 
ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and 
customer base.

With launch next week of this new product we need to be sure we are on the 
same page and I've left messages to ensure that we are.  The heat is on and 
your full co-operation is needed to make launch possible and a success.

Attached for you info is a restricted list procedure (in draft) we'll be 
finalising and rolling out in Europe over the next day or two. It will go to 
all business heads in Europe to ensure  that when we get confidential info in 
about an entity that  entity is notified to legal and the entity placed on 
the list.  We then stop trading online in that entity.  As you already have a 
restricted list process in the US you may well not need anything new, but 
this may help if need be.

Sullivan & Cromwell have drafted a separate and distinct confidentiality 
procedure which you have already seen.  It is intended just for the credit 
trading group and Bryan and I will make sure his group (on both sides of the 
pond) is up to speed with the procedure before launch.  

In terms of avoiding being sued by reference entities to whom we might have 
fiduciary duties, we are doing three things:

(i)  notifying the entities tomorrow about the new product and the fact that 
we'll be quoting them online.  Hopefully this should flush out potential 
problem cases.

(ii)  Bryan is calling round all Enrton relationship managers asking whether 
we have relationships which are arm's length with the ref entities - if there 
is any doubt about it, we will err on the side of caution and not quote on 
that ref entity.

(iii) we will try to identify whether there are outstanding confidentiality 
agreements with the entities - (this will certainly not be decisive and I 
place more store by (i) and (ii) from a practical perspective). Again, if in 
doubt we will take the ref entity off the list.  

Finally, on the capacity of counterparties, we have recently received a list 
of those to be included initially and I know you have too.  Most are big, 
sophisicated players but we will check capacity anyway where need be.  We 
trust you will do likewise, as per Sullivan & Cromwell's advice. 

John Sherriff will be asking Bryan tomorrow whether this project is all clear 
on the legal side botth there and in the US and it would be good to be able 
to give positive soundings.  Perhaps then we can speak early tomorrow on 
this.  Many thanks indeed.

I just spoken Metzler about CRM's view on the proposed sale of protection on 
Constellation Power Source to Deseret.  The following was discussed:

 - We have negatively rated Deseret at 10 to reflect the coop's high degree 
of leverage, low profitability and the uncertainty of regional power 
deregulation (impact on coop's difficult to assess).  In addition, we have 
had tremendous difficulty agreeing on contractual credit terms.  I will 
provide more details tomorrow.

Not wishing to reply out of turn, the legal approval process for Reference 
Entities will be essentially the same for the website as for Enron Online.  
It is possible, given the tight timing, that some "finishing touches" needed 
to be put to this process after the launch of the website.  Also, Legal will 
be producing formalising the procedure (most likely by means of a checklist) 
to assist the lawyer/paralegal charged with performing the legal approval 
process. 

Also, please note that the process in London and Houston for approving 
Reference Credits is essentially the same - any difference merely reflects 
the more developed/diverse nature of the businesses in Houston and the fact 
that there are a number of General Counsels there who need to sign off, while 
there is only one in London.

I trust this helps.

Regards

Paul

Dear Mark,

Thanks for your thoughts and mark up.  I agree with the points that you 
make.  I've redone the definition which l think now covers the SP and BP 
amounts.  I've run it by Slaughter's and they are happy with it.  Let me know 
if you are and then we can knock it on the head!!

Best wishes, Edmund.

Edmund - 

I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives 
(I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have 
attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I 
don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is 
already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only 
creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My 
other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is 
that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't 
think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can 
discuss my concerns?

Subject: Re: Introduction of Heating Oil Products  

Dale,

Thanks for the heads up.  The comments that we have are as follows:

1. We should change the description for the up/down to read as follows:

US UNL Gasoline GC vs NYMEX Unl Oct-Dec 99

DONE

2. We need to add language to indicate that these are monthly settlements on 
both the products.  Again, this may be confusing for the people reviewing the 
product.  "Financial settlement for this product will be monthly."

THIS IS IMPLIED IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH. EACH CLENDAR MONTH IS A DETERMINATION 
PERIOD; THEN PAYMENT IS MADE 5 DAYS AFTER THE FLOATING PRICE IS DETERMINABLE, 
WHICH MAKES FOR MONTHLY SETTLEMENT B/C YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL YOU KNOW ALL 
INDEXES (UP TO THE LAST DAY IN THE MONTH) TO CALCULATE THE FLOATING PRICE. 
THIS MIRRORS ALL FINANCIAL CONFIRMATIONS.

3. We need to include the same language in the up/down like we do in the USGC 
Crack, which indentifies that we will not price if either Platt's or the 
NYMEX doesn't post.  (i.e. - Include the definition and language for "Pricing 
Date.")

DONE.

4. The Gulf Coast Unleaded Swap should be similar to the existing financial 
swap with exception to the reference (use Platt's instead of NYMEX).

DONE

Please let me know ASAP if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Pat (X31720)

Thanks for the heads up.

Assuming you are talking about the Spreads, I sent you what I hope will be 
the final version yesterday about 5:10 pm. Please take a look.

Assuming we finalize this, we then need to make a final run by Mark Taylor, 
who is in Amsterdam on business and returns on Monday. I can send things via 
e-mail and by voice mail, but there's no guaranty he take a look at anything. 
I understand the pressure, but I am at Mark's mercy - as things must have his 
approval.

Dale,

We are planning on introducing the same products for distillate that we are 
going to introduce for gasoline (up/down, GC Crack, GC Swap).  Just thought 
I'd give you a head's up.  Also, how do we stand with the Gulf Coast Swap for 
gasoline.  I'm getting some pressure to get this going here quickly.

Thanks,

Pat

P.S. - I've reviewed your comments and forwarded them along to Jim Goughary 
for his comments.  I'll hopefully have some information for you today.

Mark,

 I apologise for the delay. The developers were travelling and I had to 
literally chase them to get a response. It appears that we  do not have 
business relationships with the entities listed by you. No MOU or Non- 
Disclosure Agreements have been signed although there are discussions going 
on with a couple of entities.

Martin / Bryan,

Attached is Martin's list with a column specifying jurisdiction of  
incorporation.  As you can see there are about 15-20 c/ps that I didn't have 
that info for.  Could you forward the list to Credit for them to 'fill in the

If you have any questions let me know.

Thanks, Edmund.

Probably not my place to comment but I haven't seen anything from Bryan yet.  
We need to find a better way around this no-one is ever going to consent if 
that is required for specific customers.  But on the major point , having 
spoken to Bryan over th elast couple of days, I believe he is not going to 
quote on any entity we have a big relationship with initially.  I have seen 
the first pass at the list but know that Bryan wasn't happy with it as it 
included people like TXU.

On the other point do you actually mean consent or notification - if we send 
them a notice, follow up with  a phone call on the big ones then we can make 
a business decision about how they feel.  Do they actually need to agree on 
paper?

Louise

Subject: Re: Consent  

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after 
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference 
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were 
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was 
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities 
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each 
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or 
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing 
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of 
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been 
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by 
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet 
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business 
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require 
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to 
make important judgment calls.

My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice 
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved 
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on 
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we 
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those 
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them 
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the 
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference 
Entities as soon as possible.

Subject: Consent

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that 
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small 
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies 
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.

Subject: Credit Trading OnLine - Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me=
mo

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,=
=20
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA=
L=20
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries=
=20
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or=
=20
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed=
=20
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ=
s=20
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in=
=20
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms =
of=20
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely=
=20
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summar=
y=20
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa=
nt=20
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction=
=20
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus =
on=20
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to=
=20
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news=
=20
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo=
w=20
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, =
on=20
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely=
=20
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a=
=20
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk=
=20
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b=
e=20
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks=
=20
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t=
he=20
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t=
o=20
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in=
=20
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general=
=20
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under=
=20
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their=
=20
constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular=
ly=20
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure=
=20
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur=
=20
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ=
e=20
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o=
r=20
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US=
=20
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include=
=20
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the=
=20
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha=
t=20
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which=
=20
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali=
ty=20
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron=
=20
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o=
r=20
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will=
=20
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou=
t=20
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha=
t=20
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute=
=20
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the=
=20
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve=
=20
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear=
=20
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in=
=20
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be=
=20
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using =
a=20
"substantial professional effort" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein=
g=20
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad=
e=20
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this=
=20
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic=
=20
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi=
ng=20
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor=
y=20
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart=
y=20
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc=
e=20
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve=
r,=20
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law)=20

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und=
er=20
the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product=
=20
constitutes a "security" under US securities laws (please see attached=20
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of=
=20
securities to "accredited investors" which will allow us to deal with=20
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul=
d=20
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit=
y=20
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.

Pursuant to yesterday's emails, a point of clarification on timing.  The 
EnronOnline team due diligence process requires two full weeks from the time 
of official sign off by all relevant parties to bring a new business onto 
production for external customers. 

As soon as you are capable of providing an email which confirms your approval 
we can begin setting the products up for online transactions.  

Thank your for your cooperation.

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT, 
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL 
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries 
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via 
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway, 
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the 
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the 
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or 
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed 
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs 
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in 
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of 
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely 
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more 
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summary 
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant 
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction 
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on 
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to 
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news

Thanks very much for your memo Paul it is very helpful.  I attach below for=
=20
completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on=
=20
EnronOnline. =20
There are two remaining issues which require further thought:-

1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline. =
=20
For the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates=
=20
will be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection th=
e=20
initialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection=
=20
250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do=
=20
have some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneou=
se=20
changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much=
=20
better specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage=
=20
that many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we=
=20
will do when FX joins the system.

2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credi=
t=20
pricing from a due diligence perspective.

Elena will be leaving the EnronOnline group at the end of this week and Mar=

Subject: Credit Trading OnLine - Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me=
mo

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,=
=20
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA=
L=20
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries=
=20
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or=
=20
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed=
=20
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ=
s=20
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in=
=20
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms =
of=20
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely=
=20
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summar=
y=20
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa=
nt=20
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction=
=20
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus =
on=20
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to=
=20
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news=
=20
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo=
w=20
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, =
on=20
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely=
=20
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a=
=20
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk=
=20
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b=
e=20
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks=
=20
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t=
he=20
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t=
o=20
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in=
=20
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general=
=20
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under=
=20
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their=
=20
constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular=
ly=20
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure=
=20
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur=
=20
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ=
e=20
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o=
r=20
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US=
=20
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include=
=20
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the=
=20
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha=
t=20
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which=
=20
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali=
ty=20
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron=
=20
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o=
r=20
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will=
=20
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou=
t=20
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha=
t=20
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute=
=20
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the=
=20
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve=
=20
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear=
=20
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in=
=20
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be=
=20
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and=20
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using =
a=20
"substantial professional effort" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein=
g=20
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our=20
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad=
e=20
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should=20
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this=
=20
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic=
=20
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi=
ng=20
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisor=
y=20
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being=20
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterpart=
y=20
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offenc=
e=20
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  Howeve=
r,=20
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing=20
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law)=20

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an=20
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions und=
er=20
the US Commodities Exchange Act.=20

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product=
=20
constitutes a "security" under US securities laws (please see attached=20
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of=
=20
securities to "accredited investors" which will allow us to deal with=20
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our=20
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test shoul=
d=20
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider=20
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit=
y=20
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.

As you probably all know, we are on the verge of launching credit derivatives 
trading in Europe and North America, both on Enron Online and off-line.  This 
will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy protection in 
respect of reference entities, many of whom are our counterparties in a 
variety of different commercial and financial contexts.

This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises 
significant novel legal risks for Enron.  Probably the most significant risk 
arises where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and 
wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that 
entity.  This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron.  In 
practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very 
difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard 
that information.

Against this background is the ever-present risk of "insider dealing".  This 
crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited 
fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in 
the securities (shares or bonds) of a listed company on the basis of 
unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information.  In addition, SFA 
rules require the safeguarding of confidential information, the misuse of 
which is a serious disciplinary matter.

In order to ensure the success of this new business, we are now introducing 
new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple Restricted List 
procedure.   In essence they require you - 

to take prudent steps to safeguard confidential information within Enron
to notify Michael Brown, Mark Elliott or myself if you become aware of 
confidential information (or circumstances) about a counterparty which you 
think might make it appropriate for that counterparty to be placed on the 
Restricted List.

To make life easier, numerous examples of the types of information which 
might be relevant are set out in the attached procedures,  so please 
familiarise yourself, and anyone else in your group you think appropriate,  
with them.  As you will see, you are not expected to make difficult 
determinations about whether an entity should or should not be added to the 
Restricted List, just to let us know if you think there is a possibility that 
it should be added.  We will also provide quick briefing sessions to ensure 
that each of you is comfortable with these new procedures.

  Many thanks for your co-operation.

On the issue of whether we have any objection to using EPTL as the entity, we 
have no objection. The only thing to consider is that in creating the 
inability to net exposures, it may increase the problem of utilising credit 
limits.

Thanks, David - we'll put in collateral provisions along the line of the 
short, one-sided (in our favour!) ones we have in the Online GTCs for our 
other products.

There are 2 other credit related issues we'll need to resolve as soon as poss
whether you're comfortable using EPTL (plse see my earlier mail)
whether we need a change in control provision in the GTCs and, if so, in what 
form (see Slaughters mail which I'll send you now)

Subject: GTCs

Just a quick note to let you know that I have discussed the GTCs again with 
outside counsel and will be in a position to circulate revised drafts for 
comment either late tonight or first thing tomorrow morning.  As you know the 
GTCs are being reformatted to relect the country of the reference entity 
rather than that of the counterparty.  Though not difficult, this is 
logistically tricky.

The main outstanding issue will be resolving form of  the tax  provision we 
need to include in the GTC.

Credit may also still be an issue ie do we need the right to call for 
collateral, especially where we are the buyer of the credit product and 
concerned about the seller's creditworthiness?  Grateful if credit could 
opine on this so the relevant provisions can be added quickly tomorrow if 
needed.

Many thanks

Paul

Highlighted means that we have an agreement that you are not comfortable with 
at this point?  I just finished going through the European names with Michael 
and Paul.  Luckily a small enough office that we can get through the actual 
CA's pretty quickly.

Any chance we have any flexibility on ATT, Lucent, Air Products, Dow, DuPont, 
GE, IMC, Minnesota Mining&Mfg., Pitney Bowes, Praxair, Sprint.  We only have 
5 that we can take off without needing to put additional names up?

Thanks for your call Friday and sorry I wasn't available.

You asked for our analysis concerning the fact that the website will include 
price data (initially on the full list of 200 or so Reference Entities) which 
will be generally available to be seen, but not traded on by parties 
accessing our credit website.

You're quite right that, prima facie, although trading on these names will 
not be possible in all countries from which the credit website may be 
accessed, the concerns discussed relating to confidential info are still 
pertinent.  Ultimately, we have managed to get reasonably comfortable with 
these issues (along with outside counsel), based on the following mitigants:

a special disclaimer (legal and privacy statement) blessed by US and UK 
counsel will appear on the website (this emphasises "no reliance" by parties 
visiting the website)
the due diligence for the 8 countries we reviewed - since they include Common 
Law and Civil law jurisdictions (particularly the US and UK) - should have 
flushed out the main issues likely to arise in other countries
provided we adhere to our new procedures governing confidential information, 
these should be effective to prevent similar claims which might arise under 
the laws of most other countries
as a general point, it is impossible to do legal due diligence in all 
countries having internet access and many legal commentators take the view 
that a pragmatic stance can be taken in the context of internet marketing 
provided the markets where due diligence has not been performed are not being 
specifically targeted for business.

Timing - The Wesite will launch this Wednesday as planned, but it now appears 
(as I think you know) that the Online team in Houston are requiring up to 2 
clear weeks to set up the new product. This means that crdit trading on Enron 
Online will launch on or before 8 March.

I hope this helps and look forward to speaking to you tomorrow.

Regards

Paul

David,

Thank you for your comments on the US GTC.

Taking each of your main points in turn:

Section 2(e)(i)(1) - This Section does not preclude us from doing business 
with banks or other financial institutions. 

As you anticipate, breach of warranty constitutes an Event of Default 
entitling termination.  

Section 1 - Your main concern appears to focus on the issue of sleeving.  As 
you will see, we have included in Section 1 of all GTCs a provision 
prohibiting transactions to be entered into by the reference entity itself or 
by any of its affiliates.  Any purported transaction of that sort is 
automatically void.  We considered carefully (both internally and with 
outside counsel) going further than this by including a provision stopping 
parties acting in concert with reference entity groups.  We concluded that 
such a provision would be inappropriate for two main reasons.  First, as a 
practical matter, it is almost impossible to police such a provision and 
detect cases of such collusion.  Secondly, if we were to find out about such 
collusion, we would be entitled to withhold payment (regardless of any 
contractual provision) on the basis that such collusion constitutes fraud. 

It is also worth pointing out in this context that sleeving is not an issue 
germaine only to credit derivatives trading online.  It is possible in the 
existing OTC credit derivatives markets for this kind of activity to be 
perpetrated.  You will not find any provisions in existing market 
documentation addressing this point - indeed, the new 1999 ISDA Credit 
Derivatives Definitions are consistent with this.

I only hope that reference entities do not follow the devious thought 
processes set out in your options (a)-(c) (and we will clearly have to keep 
an eye on you if you ever decide to pursue a different career!).

It is not "nasty" defining Enron as the "Determination Agent". This accords 
with the standard ISDA Master Agreement and, in fact, is less dramatic than 
the ISDA insofar as all Enron will be required to do as Determination Agent 
is to verify the validity of notices submitted under transactions (in the 
context of ISDA, all sorts of complex calculations and subjective evaluations 
fall to be made by the "Calculation Agent").

Thanks very much for thinking through the issues on the GTC and reviewing it.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.

Best regards.


Paul Simons

I have looked over the U.S. credit GTC and the long descriptions. I see we 
have decided to go with quarterly billing, rather than monthly. Will the 
payment/collections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office?

I didn't spot any problems with the long descriptions.

A few relatively minor comments on the GTC's - which you may or may not want 
to consider:

- Clause 2.(e) (i) (1) - Does this clause preclude us from doing business 
with banks or other financial institutions? Could we append: "with regard to 
the Transaction"?

- What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken? Does that constitute 
sufficient breach to terminate the contract? I'm thinking specifically about 
sleeving, which is perhaps covered by Clause 2(e)(ii)(1)? I still think that 
sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online 
trading of derivatives. If I were working for a third party, I'd immediately 
look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the 
Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own 
risk differently from Enron. If I were the Reference Entity in question, I'd 
consider:
 a) Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy - 
then do a Phoenix (in the UK at least)
 b) Buy a load of protection via sleeving, then take the Credit Derivatives 
to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives 
as collateral to increase my line of credit - I'm no expert, but I suspect 
there might be an interesting leverage effect here, which might actually 
cause a significant increase in Enron's risk exposure.
 c) Like (b), only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative 
with or without the need for sleeving - we probably need a restriction on 
this? (I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up 
front, but if I were a financial insitution, I'd quickly find a way around 
this limitation - Affiliates or Sleevers.

-  Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against 
sleeving by adding something to Clause 2, like: "It is not entering into a 
Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the 
party (or any Affiliate of such party) which is the Reference Entity in the 
Transaction".

- Should Def'n of "Contract Currency" be "Contractual Currency"? 
("Contractual" is also used in the Long Descriptions)

- Def'n of "Credit Product" - after "Entity", should we insert "which is"?

- Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as 
"Enron"? As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a 
context similar to that of an arbitrator, it seems a bit cheeky to then 
define ourselves as the arbitrator - would this be enforceable if we were in 
court?

I'm assuming the other GTC's are very similar to the U.S. one and I have not 
read them.

The exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises 
significant novel legal risks for Enron.  As most of you will by now know, 
probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has 
confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that 
information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity.  This could well 
result in legal proceeding against Enron.  In practice, an allegation of 
misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend 
without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information.  In 
fact,  Enron's credit trading will, as you know, rely strictly on publicly 
available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential 
information, unless the reference entity has specifically consented.  
Nevertheless, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, we are taking 
additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with 
potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote 
prices on such entities.

Against this background is the ever-present risk of "insider dealing".  This 
crime - which in the UK carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an 
unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) 
deals in the securities (shares, bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed 
company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive 
information.  We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds 
as part of EnronCredit.com, but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of 
Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business.  In addition, SFA 
rules in the UK require the safeguarding of confidential information, the 
misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter.

In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential 
information is not misused either by Enron or its staff, we are now 
introducing important new policies and procedures in Europe and in the US.  
These procedures have been drawn up specifically for your credit trading 
group by lawyers in London, Houston and New York and are attached.  Please 
familiarise yourself, and any future member of the group,  with these 
procedures. Once you have read and understood the attached procedures each 
one of you is required to confirm this to me in writing (or by note mail).

Please note that similar procedures have been distributed to the key business 
heads in Europe who may have confidential information about reference 
entities (similar procedures are being disrtibuted to US business heads).  
This requires them to safeguard confidential information and to abide by the 
Restriced List procedure described below.  Nevertheless, you should treat 
your group as being within a Chinese Wall and see it as your personal 
responsibility not to solicit or accept from anyone in Enron information 
about reference entities which may be confidential. 

Thank you for your co-operation in implementing these important new 
procedures.  I look forward to receiving your confirmation mentioned above 
(which is also described in the procedures). 

Best regards

Paul

Ken

Further to my earlier voice-mail, I attach a copy of a Restricted List 
procedure we put together with the assistance of Slaughter and May.  The 
procedure has not yet been rolled out (since the then OTC product had not 
developed to a stage requiring implementation), but was intended to be sent 
to all business heads in Europe (ie desk heads, and staff at VP level and 
above, not just in trading). 

I hope you are able to assist us in putting together the procedures 
(including a form of consent letter) based on our discussion on Thursday and 
would be grateful if you could confirm.  

Many thanks and best regards

Paul

Dear Paul and Edmund,

Thank you Edmund for sending me the proposed amendments for the GTCs,
including those amendments agreed by your tax departments in London and the
US.  The mark up was very helpful and, as requested,  I now attach revised
copies of the UK and US GTCs showing those amendments.  The amendments shown
in the UK GTC have been made in the other GTCs except for Canada where the
amendments follow the US GTC amendments.

I have tinkered slightly with your proposed wording on Section 9 which deals
with consent for assignments where an assignment would lead to a withholding
or deduction. I have deleted the reference to a grossing-up or withholding
in respect of the payment falling on "the next succeeding Payment Date".
This could theoretically be a Seller Payment although at the time of the
assignment it would not be known whether the Seller Payment would fall due
before the next Buyer Payment.  Given that the wording is "for the avoidance
of doubt" only, I think it is acceptable to state the position in more
general terms.

I wonder whether or not there should also be a specific reference to
withholding consent where rights are assigned to an entity which is outside
the jurisdictions where we have taken a legal advice on the product.  The
wording could, for example, refer to a requirement for a legal opinion to be
given in respect of a proposed transferee to satisfy the non-transferring
party that the transferee would be bound by the terms of the GTC.  However,
you may wish to rely on the more general protection  that to withhold
consent in these circumstances would be reasonable and it is therefore
covered by the existing wording.

It is also arguable that it would be reasonable to withhold consent in
circumstances where there is an assignment to a particular assignee and a
withholding or deduction is likely to occur as a result of that assignment
and that the additional "for avoidance of doubt" wording is also
unnecessary. One point which has occurred to us is that the final sentence
of Section 9 which permits transfers by Enron for financing purposes is not
qualified by the need to obtain consent to an assignment.  This is clearly
in Enron's favour but the additional "for avoidance of doubt" wording may in
fact highlight the final sentence of Section 9 to the counterparty and, on
that basis, it may be  better to leave out the "for avoidance of doubt"
wording altogether.  Perhaps we could like to discuss this point further in
the morning.

There seems little point at this stage circulating the GTCs for the other
jurisdictions as further changes may be required depending on the responses
from the foreign lawyers.  Subject to those responses, my understanding is
that the GTCs are now in their final form.  If there are any additional
comments to come form your tax or commercial teams, it would be  helpful if
these could be sent over before close of play today so that we can produce a
final round of drafts with all comments included. Of course, if you have any
comments on the attached, please let me know.

Kind regards,
Gavin

Paul, 

Mark T. asked me to have a look at the GTC's you prepared for Credit 
Derivatives in the USA. I think you did a great job on the GTC's and have 
just a few  suggestions/comments/questions: 

1. Would it not be easier for the Counterparty to understand the document if 
the Definitions were in Section 1? Failing that, it would be helpful to 
indicate upfront that there is a glossary of Defined Terms at the end of the 
document.   

2. I agree with Mark that we would expect for a signed Confirmation to 
control over the GTC's (and/or ETA). Section 1 is inconsistent with this idea.

3. Section 2(d)(iii): I wonder why we are making the Trade Option rep. here. 
I would not have thought that a Credit Option could be considered a 
"commodity derivative". Put another way - does Sullivan and Cromwell really 
think that the CFTC has jurisdiction over credit products? I would have 
thought credit products are more similar to an OTC equity derivative. I 
wonder if they have considered any potential SEC issues.

4. Section 2 - under the BOLDED WARNINGS, (C) regarding "... Enron ceasing to 
provide quotations".  This seems inconsistent with  the opening paragraph 
which says that  this website should not be construed as an offer by Enron to 
buy or sell. If that is the case, why is Enron providing quotations? Seems to 
me that if one is offering a quotation, one is offering the price at which 
one will buy or sell. 

Also, I would recommend to clarify the last sentence in (C)  by adding at the 
end of "credit products", both times it appears, the words "with Enron". 
There is nothing to stop the Counterparty from entering into new credit 
products with third parties but the current wording could be taken to imply 
this. 

5. Section 4 "Events of Default": In the 8th Line, after the word "Party", I 
would insert "to comply with". 

6. Remedies: Was it a conscious decision to give the Defaulting Party Five 
Business Days to pay the amount it owes but give Non-Defaulting party Ten 
Business Days?   

7. Termination: In clause (c), it should refer to the Scheduled Termination 
Date.

8. Section 11 (C): I would suggest to insert at the end thereof to add 
something along the lines of, "as soon as such party becomes aware of any 
inaccuracy or misrepresentation."

9. Section 11 (D): Please check with ENA Tax - I believe we are using new tax 
forms which have replaced the W-8 and 1001. 

10. Section 13  "General Definitions": 

"Buyer Payment Date" I would recommend that the Buyer Payment Dates be 
specified in the actual trade confirmation. This is something I can foresee 
the traders changing for every transaction.

"Effective Date" : Do you mean 60 Business or Calendar Days? 

"Interest Rate": In a USD Denominated Agreement where ENA is a CP - I would 
have thought we would use an interest rate quoted by a US bank - rather than 
Barclays.  

Schedule

Governing Law & Jurisdiction: Just to echo what Mark Taylor pointed out - 
normally we are required to use Arbitration rather than Ct. jurisdiction in 
ENA Master Agreements. Haedicke feels very strongly about this. I can send 
the language if you need it.

Exclusion of Third Party Rights: There is a stray quotation mark at the end 
of this paragraph.  

I hope this is helpful - please feel free to call.

Shari

As per my voice-mail, here is a raft of GTCs including the US version.  The 
US version take on board S &C's comments, but obviously you will need to sign 
off on the US GTCs before we go live.  Grateful for any final comments asap 
as we are aiming to finalise them on Monday.

Many thanks and sorry its not much of a birthday gift (I'll make it up to

These are more names  for European reference credits which Brian intends to 
trade offline.  With the exception of two names ( TXU Europe and Helsinga 
Energia) the names look OK to me.  (They are all either publicly rated 
investment grade names or e - rated 5+ subs of major groups).  Are there any 
names here that you have an issue with ?

Mark/Bryan

Based on our meeting with Sullivan & Cromwell, a few points occur to me 
(these may well be in the "obvious" category!)

we generally don't need to worry at all about non-energy reference credits, 
since we won't have any confidential info about them (this group will over 
time become the vast majority)
there are (as I understand it) about 200 energy reference credits we are 
looking at and this class (unlike the non-energy credits) is unlikely to grow 
substantially
of the 200 energy credits, a number should be definite "ins" (eg the high 
profile, big players with whom we don't have a special relationship) and a 
number will be "outs" (ie where the relationship is much too close to risk 
quoting on them) 
perhaps we could initially launch the product with the "ins" and, over time, 
add the residual category who get the all clear.

I agree that evaluating our relationships with individual reference entities 
may be tricky and time consuming.  Perhaps the best place to start might be 
with the business person who has overall responsibility for the relationship 
in question and should have a view on the nature of the relationship and 
whether we have any info about the entity which is sensitive.  It may well be 
that we have confidentiality agreements in place, but not much confidential 
info passing under them.

Grateful for any views on this.

Paul

Subject: Re: Consent  

Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after 
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference 
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were 
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was 
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities 
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each 
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or 
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing 
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of 
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been 
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by 
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet 
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business 
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require 
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to 
make important judgment calls.

My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice 
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved 
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on 
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we 
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those 
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them 
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the 
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference 
Entities as soon as possible.

Subject: Consent

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that 
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small 
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies 
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.

I spoke to Mark Taylor today and here's what he said about quoting names on 
Mission:

1. It is generally more liberal to quote off-line than online.
2. It is very easy to quote when we are showing one price for a basket of 
names. As long as all names are equally divided. In fact legal team would 
have no objection if there are 10-15 names in the group and they are all 
equally weighted in exoposure.
3. As far as the specific list is concerned, he will get back with us with 
coments shortly.

Ted:
Please let me know who will be replacing you on this deal once you rotate (if 
you are rotating)
Also, do you have any indications on the weightage of each counter-party in 
the list.

Thanks and Regards
Moazzam

As you know, we are now launching EnronCredit.com which will involve credit 
derivatives trading in Europe and North America, both on Enron Online and 
off-line.  This will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy 
protection in respect of reference entities, many of whom are our 
counterparties in a variety of different commercial and financial contexts.

This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises 
significant novel legal risks for Enron.  Probably the most significant risk 
would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a 
reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit 
derivative on that entity.  This could well result in legal proceeding 
against Enron.  In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential 
information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate 
procedures in place to safeguard that information.  In fact, Enron's credit 
trading will rely strictly on publicly available financial information and 
will not involve the use of confidential information, unless the reference 
entity has specifically consented.  Nevertheless, to avoid  the appearance of 
impropriety, we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality 
agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding 
whether or not we will quote prices on such entities.

Against this background is the ever-present risk of "insider dealing".  This 
crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited 
fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in 
the securities (shares, bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed company on 
the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information.  We do 
not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds as part of 
EnronCredit.com, but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of Enron 
staff and could affect other parts of our business.  In addition, SFA rules 
require the safeguarding of confidential information, the misuse of which is 
a serious disciplinary matter.

In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential 
information is not misused either by Enron or its staff, we are now 
introducing new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple 
Restricted List procedure.   In essence they require you - 

to take prudent steps to safeguard confidential information within Enron
to notify Michael Brown, Mark Elliott or myself if you become aware of 
confidential or sensitive information (or circumstances) about a counterparty 
which you think might make it appropriate for that counterparty to be placed 
on the Restricted List.

To make life easier, numerous examples of the types of information which 
might be relevant are set out in the attached procedures.  Please familiarise 
yourself, and anyone else in your group you think appropriate,  with these 
procedures.  As you will see, you are not expected to make difficult 
determinations about whether an entity should or should not be added to the 
Restricted List, just to let us know if you think there is a possibility that 
it should be added.  We will also provide quick briefing sessions to ensure 
that each of you is comfortable with these new procedures.


  Many thanks for your co-operation.

FYI, there apppears to have been a sea change in Bryan's attitude to having a 
hard Chinese wall for his trans-atlantic credit trading group.  In short, he 
wants to be behind one and apparently John Sherriff is comfortable with 
this.  I have therefore asked Ken Raisler to advise us on how to construct a 
Chinese Wall from a practicle, US perspective, with the intention of having 
Sanjev at Slaughters modify the "instruction kit", as necessary, to work 
under English law.  Given Ken's involvement on equity trading, he appears to 
be the right place to start.  There remains the possibility that when the 
traders see the procedures they will change their minds and wish to stick 
with the existing procedures you have seen.

This will not impact launch of credit trading online which, as advised, is 
still set for tomorrow.

Please let me have any thoughts on this.

Regards

Paul

there is...generally, we can transact within our limits, on any of the names

Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.

Attached is the most recent list....I have aggregated the various lists 
incorporating Bill and Marks comments...in the column named credit and legal, 
if there is a Y, I believe these have been signed off (pls. confirm) if there 
is a DW it means that these have been provisionally signed off by Weekes and 
WB means Bill and Mark need to have a look.  I have chosen new names, mostly 
non energy, based on publically available information and investment grade 
credit rating...please let us know asap because we need to launch with at 
least 200 names on Wednesday.  Thanks for all of your help

Bryan



We will send more as we are able to analyze them.

Mark,

The list below contains the 20 reference entities for the launch of credit 
derivatives on EnronOnline.  According to the emails that I have seen, only 7 
of the 20 have been completely approved by legal.  My understanding is that 
both US and London credit has approved this list.  Could you verify the 
approval status for these entities?

Let me know if you have any questions/comments.

Thanks for the help!

Frank

Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. is NOT and approved reference 
credit because this entity does not prepare independent financials.  Duke 
Energy Trading and Marketing's "A-" S&P rating is based on implied credit 
support from Duke Energy which owns a substantial portion of the entity's 
membership equity.  Our policy thus far is that all reference credit must (i) 
be S&P rated and (ii) prepare entity level financials.

Subject: Approved reference credits for Credit derivatives trading

Mark/Bryan,

I've attached a file for your use in preparing for the launch of credit 
derivatives on EnronOnline next week. It is substantially the same list that 
was sent earlier for the launch of the EnronCredit.com site, minus the 
companies which have already been discussed and removed. It also includes 
those we have approved from a credit standpoint the last few days, namely 
British Airways plc and National Westminster Bank plc. 

I am copying our legal staff on both sides of the pond to ensure we are all 
comfortable with these entities as reference credits for Online. Please 
respond if there are objections to any name listed so that RAC-Credit can 
maintain a comprehensive list of those fully approved by both credit and 
legal. In addition, let me know if there are counterparties who you believe 
have been approved as reference credits and are not on this list

Best regards,

Debbie

Attached is the CRM revised list of reference credits to be posted on-line 
(not initially for on-line trading).  The list is substantively the same as 
we received, except for greater precision on company name punctuation and the 
deletion of the following names:

 Cisco Systems
 New Jersey Natural Gas Company
 Pennzoil-Quaker State Company
 Texas New Mexico Power Company
 Honeywell International Inc.
 Lexmark International, Inc.
 MediaOne Group Inc.
 National Service Industries Inc.
 Raychem Corp
 Sundstrand Corp.
 Time Warner Inc
 US West Communications Inc.

The above names were deleted for a variety of reasons, but NOT due to weak or 
questionable credit strength.  Rather, the deletions are typically due to an 
inconsistency of names between SEC document filings and S&P rating.  The 
inconsistency is most likely reconcilable through and analysis and 
understanding of the corporate structure and recourse mechanics for each 
company.  CRM can address these issues and potentially add names after the 
initial launch.
