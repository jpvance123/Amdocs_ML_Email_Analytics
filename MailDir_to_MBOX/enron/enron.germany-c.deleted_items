IT is available and may be attractive in the coming months between Niagara and Leidy.  I can, and would like to discuss month long IT contracts along that path.  It may get hot sometime this summer, you never know, and gas would be valuable at Leidy.

I have 20,000 dth East side storage available on an ISS transaction.  I can even supply the gas on an IAS basis for the additional injection, if you have the credit.

Natural Gas Futures and Cash Continue Lower

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower after the AGA announced natural gas inventories jumped 117 Bcf last week, well above market expectations. The July contract fell $0.091 to $3.801 per MMBtu and August dipped $0.087 to $3.888 per MMBtu. The AGA reported storage levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 46 Bcf more than a year ago. Last years injection was 78 Bcf and the 5-year average injection of 81 Bcf for the comparable weeks. The large build was driven by a lack of demand on Memorial Day and mild weather. Warmer weather is expected to affect much of the nation over the next several days, limiting the upside reaction. The hot weather in the southwestern states will begin to expand into Texas and the central Plains this weekend extending into the Southeast next week. Look for the market to continue lower today under the weight of the 117 Bcf injection. But, with the summer heat and the hurricanes beginning to show up, it is becomin!
g !
increasingly dangerous to short the market. The next key level of technical support is $3.60, with $4.00 and $4.20 offering resistance. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US dropped $0.15  $0.25 per MMBtu, except out west where prices tumbled over $1.00. Canadian spot prices tumbled about $0.50 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.23 to $3.76 per MMBtu.

Enron's Dabhol Takes MSEB to Court

    Enron's Dabhol Power has filed a petition before the Bombay high court challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission in trying to resolve a dispute between it and an Indian state utility that has threatened nearly $3 billion worth of foreign investment. MSEB began defaulting on its payments six months ago to Dabhol saying that its power was too costly. It also cancelled its purchases and said it would be unable to lift output from the second phase. Dabhol filed for arbitration
and issued a preliminary notice to cancel its contract with MSEB. The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors. Global credit rating agency Moody's said last week the dispute has raised concerns over whether India would be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. Foreign lenders want to cancel their loans worth $600 million to the project while the local lenders are against it.

BPA Power Contract Rates Up

    The BPA says wholesale power rates will be offered at a 150% or greater premium in October, and that it has achieved 51% of its goal to lower demand for its power. For aluminum producers, that means they would have to pay about $50 per MWh for BPA power once their new five-year contract takes effect on October 1st. That is a substantial increase over the $24 per MWh smelters in the Pacific Northwest were used to paying under their expiring five-year contracts, but much less than the 250% to 300% increase BPA anticipated last April. The BPA has been negotiating with industrial customers to reduce their power demand. In return, BPA agrees to pay their employees' wages. Most aluminum smelters in the Northwest have already curtailed or stopped operating to comply with BPA's request. Customers have until June 22nd to complete their negotiations for power contracts. On June 29th, BPA will submit power rates to the FERC.

New Coal Fired Power Plants Making Comeback

    New coal-fired power plants are now being planned after a decade in which almost none were built in the US. But, now 34 coal plants are being planned to meet ever increasing power needs across the nation. Energy Secretary Abraham has called for 1,300 new power plants over the next 20 years to meet projected demand. Electricity demand has more than doubled over the last 20 years. Coal currently fires more than half of US electricity production. The expansion of coal power plants has been put off pollution concerns. Cleaner burning natural gas produces only 15% of the nation's power, but increasing quickly. Natural gas emits 43% less carbon dioxide than conventional coal burning. As a result, 90% of planned power plants are natural gas fired. But, now scrubbers that cut up to 90% of sulfur dioxide emissions and growing amounts of nitrogen oxide. Peabody Group, the largest coal company in the world, is planning a $1.5 billion 1,500 MW Thoroughbred plant slated to come onlin!
e !
in 2005 in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. That plant, which Peabody plans to make an environmental showcase, will be built beside a coal mine. Illinois plans to build three coal-fired plants. Last week the state legislature approved a $3.5 billion package of tax incentives and low-cost loans for the construction of new power plants that can burn high sulfur coal from Illinois.

California Power Bill Dead

    House Republicans have declared dead a proposed bill to help California avoid summer power outages, after Democrats refused to drop demands for wholesale price caps opposed by President Bush. But as power shifts from Republicans to Democrats in the Senate, there is a continued battle over price controls. The FERC, which has authority to cap prices, also opposes them. Republicans, without more support, simply ran out of time to help California, which faces many hours of blackouts this summer. The proposed legislation would have also waived some clean air regulations to allow power plants to operate during peak times, relieved transmission congestion with new lines and forced the federal government to cut energy use in its California offices 20%. The bill-writing session collapsed after California Rep. Waxman sought an amendment to stop what he called price-gouging by wholesale power sellers.

Study Says More Natural Gas Drilling Restricted

    More of the recoverable natural gas in the Rocky Mountains is off-limits to drilling than previously thought, according to a new DOE study. A review found that about 68% of the recoverable supplies in the Greater Green River Basin in southern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado, up to 79 Tcf, is either closed to drilling or under significant access restrictions. The conclusions are much higher than a similar 1999  study which said 40% was off limits. The US consumes about 23 Tcf of natural gas per year. The studied area covered almost 29 million acres of land with almost 160 Tcf of gas, of which 16 million acres with 117 Tcf was under federal ownership. Slightly over two-thirds of the recoverable federal natural gas in the study was either closed to development or available with restrictions.

TRENTON/BLACKRIVER "BOOM" IN WEST VIRGINIA

Land and Mineral Development LLC., Vienna, West Virginia, owns 85,000 acres of mineral rights in Southeastern West Virginia. The first Trenton/Blackriver production found in the state, was in a well drilled in 1962 by Tidewater Oil Company adjoining our property. We need an industry
partner. Geophysicist report and other information available.  The 85000 acres would also make a great gas storage field.

We also have another small storage field for sale near the new Trenton Wells.

Qualified Industry Principals only please.
This is not an offer to sell anything to anyone.

PUC Delay Pushes SCE Toward Bankruptcy

    A delay by the California PUC in implementing parts of a state-sponsored $2.76 billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison may lead the utility into bankruptcy. The PUC will meet today, but had not put on its agenda the regulatory changes which were agreed upon last April by the utility and the governor. If the PUC doesn't implement the changes by Friday, the state or the utility could back out of the plan. The political reality is that Edison is likely going to slouch toward Chapter 11. The legislature has 120 days to approve the plan which has been faulted as too generous to SCE and of little use to consumers and creditors, while throwing California into the power generation business. SCE has a long line of creditors awaiting back payments, including at least 30 power generators that have sued it. It only takes three to throw the utility into involuntary bankruptcy. Some analysts think that risk is already very high.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny 
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 
 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 
S time running out for Enron (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE >)?
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron's arrogance had grown even more quickly. 
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - for electricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enron said - especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets.
"We are on the side of angels," Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. "People want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's the American way."
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are mounting.
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion in shareholder value.
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low of $15.04 earlier in the day. 
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resume day-to-day control of the company.
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, available for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilling could not be reached.
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas.
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today faces a potential cash crunch.
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash.
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=C >) and J. P. Morgan Chase, which have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a producer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy- markets economist, emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.
"You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - are they good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?" Mr. Verleger said. "It's got everyone scared."
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company.
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the company's sales and profits.
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible downgrades.
"The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit," said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc. (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ILA >), one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Kansas City, Mo.
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reliant Energy (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=REI >), the El Paso Corporation (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=EPG >) and Dynegy (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=DYN >), are continuing to do business with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.
"They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down," he said. 
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation.
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy- trading company had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements.
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask. 
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statements parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=AZX >), Enron's water company subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference.
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial officer when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholders' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships. 
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its shares rose.
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors.
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow - have both left the company.
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them, he said, "You're getting way over my head."
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the S.E.C. investigation. "There is not a whole lot we can say, or should say, about them," Mr. Palmer said. He also said the company expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year.
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write- down and its other partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. "If Enron is unable to clarify its off- balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets," he wrote in a research note after the call.
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, a higher-than-normal volume.
"We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - and we're working on that," Mr. Lay said in a statement. "But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron."
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enron's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years.
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off- balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees.
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets - including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy. 
"As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down," Ms. Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to "sell" from "neutral."
"The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts," Ms. Coale said.
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say.
"The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable," said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. "The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable."
James Chanos, a leading short- seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, "Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?" Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits.
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.
"With these guys, they tell us - and all you've got is their word - that they're hedged," said Mr. Verleger, the economist.
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet- trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices.
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. Enron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-quarter of all trading in the United States.
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and their rates - and ability to deliver enough electricity - were overseen by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-growing portion of the nation's power.
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline company, to move into the trading business.
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in February, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as "security brokers, dealers and flotation." Before, it had said it was in the business of "wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products."
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involvement.
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - unless Enron loses its investment-grade credit rating before that.
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's credit. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy markets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that positions that should offset each other do not.
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share price, could rebound.
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enron's plight.

                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION                                 
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 18, 2001

Notice ID: 3193
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its 
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the 
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine 
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the 
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission 
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous 
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and 
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure 
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update 
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that 
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the 
specified dates. 

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123 
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia 
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start 
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and 
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments 
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for 
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly 
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and 
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into 
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.  

If you have any questions, feel free to contact your Customer Services Team.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Two Full Days, August 6-7, 2002

Energy Consumers and Producers 

Are you a consumer that hesitated to buy forward in 2000 or bought too soon last year?  Are you a producer who hedged too early in 2000 and did not hedge enough in early 2001?  Did you take undue credit risk because you did not know how to estimate exposure?  Are you comforting yourself with the fact that you did not hedge to make money?  Let's face it - you did not hedge to lose money either.  Kase's Derivatives for Energy Professionals will provide you with the indispensable strategies and tactics you need to avoid costly errors and equip you to make the important hedging decisions necessary for survival in today's treacherous marketplace.

Good Morning All....

I think its going to be a great Wednesday.  It may hit 70 here in Buffalo!  The City will have to get warm soon and when it does storage injections will slow and I'll have some ISS available.  I don't have any today.

IT is available.  I am working with some of you on deals already, the others may want to start watching the Niagara - Leidy spread.

As the weather was surprisingly warm yesterday compared to the forecast, we are currently experiencing record injections and are attempting to cut back some of the over-injections that we've accepted during the last few days.  Therefore we are accepting no additional over-injections other than downhole transfers.

Niagara/Pendleton to Ellisburg &/or Leidy  remains wide open for transportation through the system.  (100,000+ through Concord).

I'll be leaving for Canada for a little fishing on Friday.  In my absence, Debbie Kupczuk will be accepting Daily Capacity Desk calls @ 716-857-7602.

or you could leave a message.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

    Thursday, May 31, 2001 Issue 29   EDITORIAL  Today and Tomorrow-what As=
ia faces and what we've all learned from the past  As you probably know, th=
e Eyeforenergy team is off to Mexico next week for our Latin American e-bus=
iness in energy conference.  But to prove that our interests are global, ou=
r Insight article this week focuses on the state of the energy in Asia.  Li=
ke their colleagues in Latin America, Europe and North America, energy exec=
utives in Asia are facing a host of changes-e-business, regulatory changes,=
 and the commercialization of alternative and micro energy sources.  All of=
 these are examined in the article below, and it paints an interesting pict=
ure of the state of play in Asia today and what sort of challenges they fac=
e tomorrow.   In other news, the move towards online trading continues apac=
e in the energy industry (unlike recent developments in most other industri=
es) with announcements by Pantellos and Duke Energy North America.  Pantell=
os' move into the international arena with its procurement solution points =
towards the increasing use of online marketplaces in the energy supply chai=
n (or at least a refusal to give up in the wake of Petrocosm's demise).    =
  While Duke's announcement of their move to OpenLink's software points tow=
ards the increasing use of Internet technology on the commodity side of ene=
rgy trading.   Either way, the energy sector seems to be one of the few bri=
ght spots in the wake of the dot com gloom. The energy industry's measured =
response and refusal to jump on the e-commerce bandwagon at the start seems=
 to be proving dividends now.  Perhaps the rest of the new economy is learn=

I am unable to offer any ISS for an intra day nomination today or for tomorrow's gas day.  Operations is anticipating warm weather in Buffalo, (a balmy 65 degrees) so our LDC will be injecting at their maximum amount, as will the other firm shippers.

If you have small amounts, under 10,000 dth call me and I can let you know if we could squeeze it in somewhere.

As you all know, I tell you daily, IT is available.  Let's get strategic and use it.  Volumes over 100,000 dth can be moved North to South, or vice versa.

Now for a little Thursday inspiration.....a quote.....
"It is better to be looked over than overlooked."  - Mae West
I think that is applicable to men and women.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Subject:=09FERC Rejects FTW Rates for Transco -- Again

FYI.



NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : June 5, 2001 FERC Rejects FTW Rate=
s for Transco -- Again  Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. last week stru=
ck out again in its eight-year effort to obtain firm-to-the-wellhead (FTW) =
transportation rates similar to those enjoyed by its competitors.  Respondi=
ng to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the Com=
mission after conducting a "detailed review" upheld its earlier rejection o=
f Transco's bid to levy two-part FTW rates on distribution customers served=
 by the pipeline's production-area mainline [RP92-137-050, RP93-136]. It co=
ncluded that the FTW rate structure would force distributors to pay for ser=
vice that's not included in their contracts with Transco. Therefore, Transc=
o's existing IT-feeder transportation rates for service on its supply later=
als will remain in force.  The "fundamental issue" in this "long and somewh=
at tortuous" case is: who should pay the fixed costs of Transco's supply la=
terals -- 1) the producers and marketers who contract for service on the su=
pply laterals and currently pay all of the fixed costs; or 2) Transco's fir=
m transportation customers (distributors) who converted from bundled sales =
to transportation on the pipeline's mainline? The producers and marketers, =
who transport gas on Transco's supply laterals, favor a switch to a two-par=
t FTW rate structure because it would lighten their fixed-cost burden. Tran=
sco advocates the rate shift because it believes this would encourage more =
producers to attach their supplies to its system. But the pipeline's distri=
butor customers are opposed to being charged FTW rates on supply laterals, =
which they don't use.  FERC agreed with Transco's distributor customers -- =
who it calls FT-conversion customers -- in its remand decision. After condu=
cting a lengthy examination, "we conclude that the FT- conversion customers=
' firm contracts [distributors] with Transco do not include service on the =
supply laterals. Rather, the producers and marketers contract and pay for t=
he IT-feeder service [on the laterals]," last week's order noted. "Therefor=
e, the 'Memphis' clauses of the FT-conversion shippers' contracts cannot au=
thorize Transco to require the FT-conversion customers to pay two-part rate=
s for service on the supply lateral not included in their contracts. We, th=
erefore, reaffirm our rejection of Transco's proposal to unilaterally impos=
e FTW service on the FT-conversion shippers." =09

Man those steaks I cooked Saturday were great.   Bought six Rib Eyes, amn
were they good.   I hurt myself.  Barb had to use the big tractor to move
me around.  If I die from plugged arteries it's yall's fault.   Me having
to eat all those steaks alone.

Not really, we did not have steaks, well not till Sunday when Barb and I
went to El Tora.   We are going t BBQ July Fourth if you guys would like to
come.   Chance is coming in from teh Navy so thought we might cook some.
Dennis and Janice are coming down also.   Figure we will have baked beans,
potatoe salad, few deserts.   Maybe even home made Ice Cream.   You guys
are invited.   Should be lots of babies there.  (New Borns).   I have the
jet ski setting by the water on the bank and will drop the poontoonn boat
in this weekend for riding up ad down the Bayou.

See ya,

Oh yeah Chris, when you called last night Barb and I were out riding the
Scooter around.   Just Chilling.  We rode around looking at houses, yards
etc in town for about 1.5 hours.   It was nice.  Life is good.

Don, your Ex came by Friday for some plants.   She seemed to be doing well.
How about you?

Well gotta go,

Bayou Jer

I have some really bad news.  My little girl, when she makes a frown face,
she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.  I think that's a very bad sign.

She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today.

June 24 -- Not so long ago, you could stand at the now infamous tilted E do=
wntown and look north down Electricity Alley -- the thriving nexus of some =
of world's biggest energy trading companies. These days, that stretch is mo=
re like a row of steel and glass dominoes in danger of being tipped by the =
fall of the E logo's namesake: Enron Corp. Energy companies that were proud=
 to show off fast-growing operations and glitzy new trading floors are now =
cutting deeply and concentrating on tangible assets, such as pipelines and =
power plants. A rush to convince investors they're not the next Enron is ta=
king it's toll on the people who held the high-pressure, high-paying jobs o=
n the trading floors of those downtown skyscrapers.

June 24 -- The United States needs to get moving to protect nuclear plants =
and the power grid against future attacks and may need to reorganize the wa=
y government agencies work together, top scientists said on Monday. The cou=
ntry also has "enormous vulnerabilities" to a chemical or biological attack=
, made clear after the Sept. 11 attacks, said a report from the National Ac=
ademy of Sciences, an independent organization that advises the government.=
 One top priority will be working with Russia to keep track of nuclear weap=
ons and radioactive material that could be used either in a nuclear attack,=
 or in a "dirty bomb" that would spread radioactive toxins using a conventi=
onal blast.

Enron Used Reserves To Hide Profits <http://hsweb01.screamingmedia.com/PMA/=

June 24 -- Enron Corp. used hidden reserves to conceal up to $1.5 billion i=
n trading profits during the California power crisis, six former executives=
 and managers told the New York Times. In its Sunday edition, the paper sai=
d the reserves would have doubled the now-bankrupt energy trader's profits =
during the California energy crisis in late 2000 and early 2001, at a time =
when politicians were accusing energy companies of profiteering and market =
manipulation. Houston-based Enron also manipulated the reserves -- which he=
ld anywhere from $800 million to $2 billion at times -- to report steady pr=
ofit growth, according to some former executives, the Times said.

June 24 -- Arizona's main electric utilities said Monday the largest wildfi=
re in the state's history so far has not burned into the transmission grid =
carrying power to the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Arizona Public Service, the=
 utility subsidiary of Pinnacle West Corp. ((PNW.N)), and the Salt River Pr=
oject, a public power utility, said the fire that has blackened more than 3=
22,000 acres (130,000 hectares) in Arizona's eastern high country has burne=
d close to two 500-kilovolt power lines but they were still operating as of=
 early today. The vast blaze, which started last Tuesday, has come to withi=
n 1-1/2 miles of a high-voltage line that runs from the Cholla power statio=
n in St. Joseph City to the Saguaro power plant north of Tucson, said Damon=
 Gross, a spokesman for Arizona Public Service.

Scientech -- June 24 -- Potomac Electric Power Company and Conectiv, announ=
ced that the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities voted to approve the merg=
er of the two companies. Today's action leaves approval by the U.S. Securit=
ies and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the last necessary to complete the mer=
ger. The merger, proposed in February 2001, has received approvals from the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and has cleared review by the=
 Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. Delaware and =
the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had previous=
ly approved the merger. Dennis Wraase, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepc=
o) president and chief operating officer said, "This is a key milestone in =
the completion of the Pepco-Conectiv merger. With the final state approval =
now in place, the way is cleared for the SEC to act. We are excited about m=
oving to this final stage, as we believe the merger offers significant bene=
fits for customers, shareholders and employees." Analysis: When Pepco and C=
onectiv decided to merge, they wanted to create the largest electricity-del=
ivery company in the mid-Atlantic region with a transmission network servin=
g 1.8 million customers in a 10,000 square-mile area.=20

RiskCenter.com -- June 24 -- Australia is risking hundreds of millions of d=
ollars in export income by not signing the Kyoto protocol on climate change=
, according to the Australian EcoGeneration Association (AEA). AEA, a peak =
group for renewable energy and energy-efficient generators, says figures pr=
ovided by federal and New South Wales research show that Australia will be =
only 5 per cent or less over its Kyoto target by 2008 when the protocol tak=
es effect. As a result, abatement measures to reduce greenhouse gas to 108 =
per cent of 1990 levels by 2008 would not be costly, AEA says. NSW recently=
 announced measures to cut per capita greenhouse emissions by 5 per cent of=
 1990 levels in 2006.

ISS is unavailable for the 5th.  I will know if there is any intra day availability after 1pm today.  If there is any I'll send a notification.

IT is available.  The spread between Niagara and Leidy points is becoming  more pronounced.  I can move up to 100,000dth.  There may be some opportunity on that path this week.

Natural Gas Futures Rally on Short Covering 

    Natural gas for July delivery on the NYMEX jumped almost 6% higher
yesterday, $0.193 to $3.43 per MMBtu, boosted by short covering from
locals and funds on a surprise of warmer summer forecasts. The August
contract gained $0.186 to $3.48 per MMBtu. A short squeeze set in and some
traders think the market is heading for $3.60. Options expire for July
today, and futures tomorrow. Look for the market to test $3.47 this
morning, and perhaps push into the $3.50s. Key options puts are seen at
$3.00, now well below the market, and calls at $3.50. Monday, fund buying
and locals pushing buy-stops shot the market into key technical resistance
levels around $3.47. Paper selling came out of the woodwork. Despite high
storage levels, anticipation of increased cooling demand helped fuel the
run. With the July contract's range lows at $3.08, there is still room for
the market to be sold. Spreads will also dominate the market the closer
the contract gets to expiration. Traders have seen a steady decline of
open interest over the last week. Open interest has fallen nearly 8% over
the last few weeks. Funds held net short positions in the last Commitments
of Traders Report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Crude oil
prices for the new front August contract rose $0.65 to $26.45 per barrel
on high Mideast tensions. Estimated natural gas volume was 125,000
contracts, with about 51,000 spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery
across the US and Canada was generally $0.15 - $0.25 higher yesterday.
Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.16 to 3.33
per MMBtu.

Insurers Say JP Morgan Misrepresented Enron Loans as Trades 

    JP Morgan Chase engaged in fake energy trades with Enron to boost its
income and trading volumes in order to attract more investors to ensure
that it could repay loans to the bank, according to court papers. JP
Morgan has filed suit against 11 insurers to collect $965 million in
surety bonds guaranteeing natural gas and crude oil contracts between
Enron and Mahonia Ltd, a subsidiary of JP Morgan. Enron filed for
bankruptcy in December and defaulted on the contracts. The insurers claim
the trades were actually disguised loans to Enron by JP Morgan and that
they would not have guaranteed the transactions if their real intent had
been revealed. JP Morgan used Mahonia to buy natural gas from Enron, which
it then resold back to the company at a somewhat higher price, the
difference essentially being interest on a secret loan by the bank,
according to the insurers. JP Morgan strongly refutes the allegations,
saying they are an attempt to get out of paying a straightforward claim.
The bank pointed out that the contracts contain language stating, 'The
obligations of each Surety hereunder are absolute and unconditional
irrespective of any circumstance whatsoever.' Apart from the energy
contracts in question, Enron owes JP Morgan $1.2 billion in secured and
unsecured loans, letters of credit and other financial obligations. It is
one of 9 banks being sued by Enron shareholders, who claim the banks
intentionally inflated Enron's stock prices to reap billions in profits
for themselves.

Xcel Shares Fall to 11-Year Low 

    Xcel Energy shares fell for a 5th consecutive day yesterday after it
said last week it expects earnings to be reduced by $40 million the rest
of this year because regulators denied a rate increase. Xcel shares
dropped as low as $13.91, an 11-year low. The shares had fallen 43% in the
past year. Xcel says it expected net income would be reduced by $5 million
per month for the rest of 2002 after Connecticut regulators denied a rate
increase at the company's NRG Energy unit. Xcel had expected a rate
increase to take effect May 1st when it issued a forecast for 2002
earnings. The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control denied the
request from NRG to increase customer bills by $0.01 per kWh.

Canadian Bank Sued by Dutch Bank Over Enron Related Debt

    Royal Bank of Canada is considering its options for fighting a lawsuit
by Dutch bank Rabobank over a disputed Enron related transaction. Royal
Bank lent $517 million to an Enron affiliated trust in late 2000. The bank
then hedged against a default on the loan by negotiating a total-return
swap with Rabobank. A total-return swap is a derivative frequently used by
big multinational banks to hedge credit risks. Rabobank contends that 3
investment bankers for Royal Bank knew about Enron's possible
susceptibility to default. The investment bankers were forced to resign
from Royal in November for not divulging  the extent of their connection
to Enron when they were hired. While working at UK investment bank,
Greenwich Natwest, the 3 bankers had structured one of Enron's limited
partnerships, which was part of Enron's complicated off-balance sheet
partnerships that eventually led to its collapse. Until the lawsuit was
filed, Royal Bank said that Rabobank had fulfilled its contractual
obligations related to the deal. Royal Bank also said it expects to
receive full and final payment from Rabobank on June 28th. If payment is
not forthcoming, Royal Bank said it may file a countersuit against
Rabobank.

Williams to Cut Trading Staff

    Williams plans to lay off about 130 trading floor staffers, or 16% of
the total. The news sent Williams shares down 8.4% to $6.53, a 9-year.
Williams  joins Dynegy, El Paso and others in cutting its sales following
the collapse of Enron. Williams also fired 11 employees at its European
trading operation, based in London. The company had about 800 people in
its trading group, including 100 traders. Williams is still determining
how many traders it will let go as part of this move. It said last week it
would sell off assets in Memphis, Tennessee, and Alaska to shore up its
balance sheet. On June 10th, Williams lowered its earnings outlook and
said it would cut jobs as part of a wide-ranging restructuring of its
trading business. It also said it would cut risk management spending by  a
third, to $1 billion, to improve its balance sheet in the face of
increased scrutiny by investors and credit agencies. Moody's cut its
credit rating to just one notch above junk status a couple weeks ago.

Senate Environment Committee Demand White House Documents

    The Senate Environment Committee will vote on Thursday whether to
subpoena the White House for documents about its decision to reduce air
pollution rules for older coal-fired power plants. Democrats and
Environmental groups have criticized the Bush administration's decision
utilities and refineries more leeway in repairing and expanding the 
plants without costly upgrading. The Senate Environment Committee is
seeking EPA records on interagency discussions and meetings with outside
interest groups on development of the new air pollution regulations. If
subpoenas are issued, it would be the 2nd time this year that a Senate
Committee has ordered the Administration to turn over energy related
documents. Last month, the Senate Governmental Affairs committee
subpoenaed White House records of its links with Enron and Kenneth Lay.
The EPA gave the committee  700 pages of documents last month, but
committee staff members said most of the pages were blank and that the
rest were unusable. Also on Thursday, the Senate Environment Committee
will vote on a proposal to place limits on power plant emissions far
beyond those recommended by the Administration earlier this year. The
draft bill would sharply limit emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur
dioxide and mercury by 2008. It also includes mandatory limits on
emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas linked to global warming.
The White House opposes mandatory carbon dioxide limits.

Dynegy Plans to Raise $2 Billion to Preserve Credit Rating

    Dynegy plans to raise about $2 billion to maintain its investment
grade credit rating and restore investor confidence. The restructuring
measures include a 50% dividend cut, the spin-off of its UK natural gas
storage business and the partial sale of its stake in Northern Natural Gas
pipeline, which it acquired from Enron as part of their ill-fated deal.
Dynegy also expects 2nd quarter earnings per share to be about the
breakeven point. The company said that its 2002 profit forecast no longer
applies, and it will issue a new earnings forecast in late July. Dynegy
was expected to earn $0.21 per share in the 2nd quarter and $1.35 in 2002,
according to the average estimates of analysts. The company said it
expects to take a $450 million pretax charge in the 2nd quarter, $300
million in expenses from its communications unit and $150 million in
severance related costs and other expenses. Fitch cut Dynegy''s debt to a
'BB+', the highest level of junk, yesterday. Moody's and S&P, both of
which currently give the company an investment grade rating, are also
considering downgrades. Dynegy says it would be able to meet its
obligations, even if its credit were downgraded by one or more services.
Dynegy said the dividend cut would provide $56 million in savings. Over
the last 2 years, Dynegy has paid a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per
share. Dynegy's partners in the Catlin venture have agreed to remove a
$270 million trigger, and it will repay or refinance bank credit in a
joint venture with NRG Energy, which will eliminate a $31 million trigger,
the company said. Dynegy plans include the sale of up to $400 million in
mortgage bonds in its Illinois Power utility and the sale of various other
assets to raise another $200 million. The company plans to sell shares in
Dynegy Energy Partners, a new company that will own and operate a portion
of its natural gas liquids business. It also plans to sell 50% of the
16,600-mile Northern Natural Gas pipeline and expects to save $50 million
per year from workforce reductions and spending cuts. In addition, the
company will attempt to make its financial results more transparent by
including more details about its earnings from regulated businesses and
from energy trading.

Enron's Trading Partners Denied Separate Creditors Committee

    The bankruptcy judge handling Enron's case has denied a petition by
some of the company's former trading partners for their own committee.
Enron owes its former trading partners about $1 billion. But the judge
says that the current creditors committee adequately represents the
interests of the trading partners, saying their proposed committee would
create further discord, litigation and delay. The judge said that the
13-member creditors committee, which includes Duke and Williams, fairly
represents the major groups that are owed money by Enron. According to the
judge, the former trading partners have not cited a single instance where
the ability of the creditors' committee to function has been impaired. The
former trading partners are creditors of Enron North America, which
generated 90% of the revenue before it collapsed. Court papers indicate
that Enron North America has adequate funds to repay its creditors. It
lists assets of $13.7 billion and debts of $8.8 billion. Creditors of
Enron NA are attempting to separate themselves from the creditors of Enron
Corp, which are owed $100 billion, to prevent consolidation of all Enron
unit bankruptcies into one large case. If the cases are consolidated, the
trading partners and other creditors of Enron North America would see
their monetary compensation diluted.

ANALYST SEES MAJOR LOW EARLY 2003

 For market technicians who combine the study of the seasonality of
natural gas prices with cycle analysis, the early part of 2003 may be a
major turning point in the direction of prices.  "Our data shows the time
cycles pointing lower into the first quarter of 2003," says Walter
Zimmerman, Vice President with United Energy, New York.  Zimmerman is an
advocate of combining the intricacies of Elliott Wave analysis with the
seasonal and cyclic characteristics of natural gas prices to make both
short and long term forecasts. One of the most intense and often difficult
to understand analytical approaches is the us of matching preconceived
price patterns to that of current price behavior to see when trends in
prices may begin or end. Elliott Wave analysis is just such a technique.
The general rule is that an Elliott pattern requires five waves to be
completed, three in the primary direction and two counter to the main
trend. Thus if natural gas prices have completed a five wave pattern, then
the current trend, either up or down, should be over. Typically prices are
never exactly at the precise beginning or end of a five wave pattern and
analysts often refer to price moves as being one of the five waves. "We
think there has been an initial leg down from $3.875 to $3.05 and now the
market is correcting that move (higher)," says Zimmerman. Seasonality is
also important and is often more easily understood that the vagaries of
Elliott Wave analysis. "The seasonality of this market is that prices
typically peak in May and bottom in January. There tends to be a
correction in between those two points where there is a bottom in
September and a rally into November. "Longer term we are very, very,
bullish. We think that the $1.76 is a major multi year low (September
2001), and all my longer term time cycle analyses point up to 2005 to
2006. A hedger would want to hedge out to the end of the year, but that's
about it. In January 2003 all the cycles turn up at the same time."

Where Did the Value Go at Enron? 
By FLOYD NORRIS 
 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 
hat really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen? 
Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE >) released its quarterly earnings a week ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions.
The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a preliminary inquiry.
Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.
The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listeners seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings release.
When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity was related to the termination of "structured finance vehicles" involving partnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial officer.
"Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how the company goes about its business," said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's "credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its own."
Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another conference call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today. 
The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many analysts. They referred to such things as "share settled costless collar arrangements" and "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts." The disclosures said the company entered into the transactions "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets."
It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall Street Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.
One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot produce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company that sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, "is the result of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods."
Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the details were not clear, "Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and they were not" worth that much.
Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released.
Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.
While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important role in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was only enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.
But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into problems, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the company's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wondered if there might have been similar deals with others.
Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to understand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for doing just that.
In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s request for information. "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest," he said.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

PJM Expands Grid

    PJM Interconnection plans to spend more than $420 million on the 2nd phase of a transmission infrastructure plan to increase reliability. This will be in addition to a $300 million transmission investment PJM initiated last summer. With a total of about 40,000 MW proposed for construction in the region, PJM last year implemented a Regional Transmission Expansion Plan to ensure the system continues to comply with regional reliability standards. The 2nd phase of the RTEP calls for transmission upgrades to accommodate 43 generation projects PJM expects to have online by the end of 2006, with a total of more than 12,500 MW of new capacity.

Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX wandered lower yesterday in uninspired trading as the market consolidated following Wednesday's surprising high storage injection. Much of the trading was conducted by local and short-term traders willing to trade for small gains, compromising price discovery. El Paso and Enron were trying to coax the market up so they could initiate sales. Traders anticipate todays activity to be similar to yesterdays lackluster pace. The July contract fell $0.011 to $3.79 per MMBtu and August also dipped $0.011 to $3.877 per MMBtu. On Wednesday the AGA reported storage levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 46 Bcf more than a year ago. After several days of cool, rainy weather, much of the eastern half of the nation will have more summer-like weather this weekend and early next weeks. Demand use will increase significantly, but will not be unusually high for early June. Hot weather in the southwestern states will begin to mo!
ve!
 into Texas and the Plains this weekend. Look for the market to continue to slip lower in the absence of any significant driving force. There needs to be something to change the dynamics of the market, but in the meantime, most everybody is on the same page, and the locals are simply trying to pick each other's pockets. The next key level of technical support is $3.60, with $4.00 and $4.20 offering resistance. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US dropped $0.05 - $0.15 per MMBtu, except out west where prices continued to tumble. Canadian spot prices rebounded from yesterdays sharp decline. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.07 to $3.69 per MMBtu.

DOE Seeks Input on Research Programs

    The DOE plans a series of town hall-style meetings next week across the nation to hear from the public, elected officials and energy experts on federal research programs that promote energy efficiency and more use of renewable fuels. The input at these meetings will help the DOE identify opportunities for future research and investment while assessing our past effectiveness. The meetings are part of a comprehensive review of the department's multibillion dollar research programs as called for in the Bush administration's new national energy plan. Environmental and consumers groups have opposed the administration's proposed budget cuts in the research programs. The first two public meetings will take place on June 12th in Atlanta and Chicago, followed by June 19th meetings in Boston and Seattle, June 21st in Denver and Philadelphia and a June 26th meeting in Washington. Each meeting will last from 9 AM to 9 PM local time.

Senate Democrats to Investigate High Energy Prices

    The new Democratic chairman of the  Senate Governmental Affairs Committee says he will examine FERCs refusal to cap wholesale power prices in western states. Following the recent shift in control of the Senate to Democrats, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut has charged that the FERC has failed to do its job, and will hold a June 20th hearing on the matter. President Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price caps, arguing they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do nothing to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation, Lieberman warned. He will also hold a June 13th hearing on the impact of deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries. A subcommittee of the governmental affairs panel is planning a separate investigation into the oil industry's record profits and high retail gasoline prices.

Canadian Producers Investigate Coal Gas

    Canadian producers are counting on obtaining big natural gas volumes from shallow coal seams. Alberta Energy, Nexen, PanCanadian Petroleum and Penn West Petroleum are spending millions of dollars to investigate whether natural gas trapped in coal beds less than 3,300 feet deep can be produced economically.  The US derives 7% of its natural gas production from coal seam gas. Western Canada is estimated to have between 135 Tcf and 260 Tcf of recoverable coal gas. Natural gas fields containing at least 17 Tcf have been discovered in Canada's Far North, but bringing them to market will cost billions to build new pipelines and other facilities. Advocates say many coal deposits sit near existing processing plants and transmission lines, meaning coal gas fields will be cheaper to connect and produce than Arctic reserves. The Alberta Research Council has spent several years researching ways to enhance coal gas production and is looking for C$12 million to proceed with a pilot pr!
oj!
ect.

El Paso Market Power Abuse Investigation Continues

    FERC's investigation into alleged market power abuse by El Paso is still proceeding a month after it began. Both El Paso and the California PUC have painted contradicting versions of events, and the hearing looks no closer to conclusion than when it began. El Paso is attempting to discredit a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant hired by Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power. It dutifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen border-basin price spreads. As part of El Paso's effort to tarnish the study, a professor of political economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Brattle's tale doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 conditions must be met: * The system for getting gas to California must not be full; * El Paso Merchant must have unutilized, but available, delivery rights; and * Other shippers!
 m!
ust have fully utilized their delivery rights. The final condition, he says proves that market power is impossible to establish.

IT through Concord is available for 90,000dth between Niagara and Leidy, 100,000 dth. between Pendleton and Leidy.

We are posting 50,000 dth excess injection on either the East or West Side but we have already seen interest from shippers with primary rights to use that space.  Therefore, I'd advise against IAS returns and excess injections.

Excess withdrawals are fine system wide and IAS advances are available for 100,000 dth.

I also want to remind you that our Firm Transport Open Season between Ellisburg and Leidy expires Wednesday, October 31st.  Please call your firm sales representative for more detail or visit our website.

Buenos Dias (I'm practicing my Spanish because I'm going to Ecuador for New Year's Eve),

On an intra day basis I have 50,000 dth excess injection on the East Side (for the 20th).  Since it is getting a little cooler here I also have 20,000 dth available on the East Side for excess injection tomorrow, nothing on the West.

IT through Concord is available, 140,000dth.  50,000 at Niagara, the rest can flow through Pendleton.

No IAS payback or ISS space.

I will be off tomorrow.  Please call Greg Maliken if you have any questions about the long weekend 716-857-7634.

I can tell you now that Thursday and Friday are predicted to be warmer and our system load will be depressed due to the holiday.  Therefore, excess on system deliveries are not going to be large.  Please use the website.  There will be daily postings available.

Happy Turkey Eating!!

Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.

Natural Gas Futures Drop Sharply After EIA Revisions 

    Natural gas for July delivery on the NYMEX lost 3% yesterday, settling
down $0.098 at $3.216 per MMBtu. The August contract lost $0.111 to $3.276
per MMBtu. The market opened higher but had a $0.19 sell-off after the EIA
reported this week's storage injection of 81 Bcf, about what was expected.
But the EIA also revised storage numbers back to November of last year. It
added 41 Bcf to last week's total, bringing the sellers out in droves.
Look for more selling today. Locals have $3.08 per MMBtu in their sights,
and will likely hit it today. Trading houses will be scale-down buyers,
and with fund selling, locals will continue to push the market downward.
Spreads also will dominate the market the closer the contract gets to next
week's expiration. Estimated volume was 111,500 contracts, with 48,900 as
spreads. The NYMEX crude oil contract expires today.  Natural gas for next
day delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.05 to $0.15 higher
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.06
to $3.29 per MMBtu.

Pemex to Offer Multiple Service Contracts for Natural Gas Production

    Pemex plans to open a data room in November for companies interested
in up to 8 politically contested multiple service contracts to produce
natural gas in the Burgos basin along the Texas border. Pemex says the
contracts would be finalized and the development blocks defined in
October. Pemex will offer the much debated multiple service contracts
individually in quick succession in November. The contracts would then be
evaluated by February and signed in March of 2003. The data room will
provide detailed seismic information about the blocks of land to be
developed, each of which is 200-650 square miles. Pemex and the government
are inviting private participation in order to double non-associated
natural gas production at Burgos to about 2 Bcf per day in order to meet
growing demand by 2006. The contracts have garnered more interest than
expected, with about 75 companies from around the world seeking more
information. Under the Mexican constitution, Pemex is not allowed to offer
a  percentage of the commodity produced as payment to companies,  because
all natural resources must remain in the hands of a government agency. The
contracts are seen as a chance to gain a foothold in Mexico's closed
hydrocarbon industry. The new contracts will be renewable for up to 20
years instead of only 1 or 2 years. Opponents say they are a means of
privatizing the country's oil and natural gas industry, which was
nationalized in 1938 and is widely regarded by citizens as a symbol of
Mexican sovereignty and economic independence. Pemex will be examining the
companies solvency, experience and execution capacity before awarding the
contracts.

SEC Launches Formal Investigation into Reliant 

    Reliant Resources has been advised by the SEC that it has issued a
formal order in connection with its investigation of certain financial
reporting by the company.  The investigation will focus on round trip
trades and on the transactions that led to a restatement of the 2001
financial results earlier this year.  These matters were previously the
subject of an informal investigation. Reliant Resources has pledged to
continue cooperating fully with the SEC staff.  A formal order of
investigation authorizes the SEC staff to compel testimony and production
of
documents, including from individuals who are not or are no longer
affiliated with Reliant Resources or Reliant Energy. The order addresses
Reliant Resources' 2001 financial statements.  In addition, the order,
which is also directed to Reliant Energy, addresses Reliant Energy's
financial statements for 1999 and 2000, when the businesses that are now
part of Reliant Resources were held by Reliant Energy. Reliant Energy also
continues to work with the SEC regarding the proposed restructuring of
Reliant Energy and the spin-off of Reliant Resources.

TXU Settles with Texas PUC

    TXU has reached a settlement with the Texas PUC over disputed
transmission and distribution rates and other issues related to the
state's $16 billion power market, which was deregulated on January 1st.
The settlement involves TXU units Oncor and TXU Energy, and will permit
TXU to sell $1.3 billion in bonds. The deal also calls for TXU to repay
customers $350 million over a 2-year period. TXU filed a plan to comply
with the Texas Electric Choice Act with the PUC in December after lengthy
negotiations with the commission and consumer groups. The $350 million
payment resolves disputes about money from excess earnings kept by TXU to
cover generating costs it did not expect to recoup once deregulation was
under way. The PUC had ordered TXU to refund almost $1.7 billion to
customers. TXU disagreed with the ruling, arguing that the PUC could not
legally order the refund.

Coal Industry Lays Off Thousands

    A sharp increase in coal industry layoffs are the results of months of
mild weather and a stagnating economy have led to falling demand and
sizable surpluses. Coal jobs in West Virginia dropped over 6% this year,
from 18,700 in January to less than 17,500 now. That drop does not include
another 700 miners at Consol Energy's Robinson Run, Blacksville and
Humphrey mines in north-central West Virginia. Miners there are idled this
week, on paid vacation the next two and uncertain after that. Massey
Energy is cutting 800 of its 5,000 workers in southern West Virginia.
Anker Coal Group laid off 190 miners this spring in Barbour and Upshur
counties. Peabody Energy laid off nearly 200 in Boone County. Last week,
American Electric Power's Kentucky Coal laid off 57 miners across eastern
Kentucky, while Coastal Coal laid off 123 miners in Kentucky's Letcher
County. Consol plans to idle its Shoemaker mine in Moundsville this month.
It previously idled the McElroy mine in the same city, with 650 jobs on
hold between the two operations. Also, market uncertainty has led Anker to
delay reopening the Sentinel Mine in Barbour County from June until fall
at the earliest.

PPL Issues Rebuttal of PJM Capacity Market Manipulation

    PPL Corp has issued a rebuttal to allegations made by Pennsylvania PUC
 that it unfairly manipulated power prices. After reviewing PPL's actions
in the PJM capacity market, the PUC released a report last week accusing
the company's subsidiary, PPL EnergyPlus, of manipulating wholesale power
markets when prices suddenly jumped from $5.00 per MWh to $177.00 per MWh
in January of 2001. PPL says that there was no independent fact-finding,
no interviews of witnesses, and no review of documents and records, other
than various filings and materials provided by PJM, before the commission
released its report. The PUC report accused PPL of deliberately
withholding power from the capacity market on the PJM grid in order to
create an artificial shortage and drive prices up. PPL contends that all
of its transactions in the capacity market were legal and ethical, and in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. PPL argues that PJM's
market rules did not prohibit its actions at the time. But, by April 2001,
when PJM changed its rules with FERC, capacity prices fell sharply and
returned to normal price patterns, the PUC said. PPL also pointed out that
the FERC had approved the design and operation of the PJM capacity market,
and after 2 investigations, did not take any action against the company.
Separately, PPL has said it would eliminate 600 jobs, or 7% of its work
force to cut costs. In addition it will reduce capital spending on new
power plants by $1.3 billion.

Dynegydirect Shutdown Until Market Stabilizes

    Dynegy sent an e-mail to customers of DynegyDirect on Wednesday night,
notifying them that the online trading system was being shutdown due to
market developments and the poor credit environment in the energy
industry. Dynegy characterized the closure as a discontinuation of
activities not a termination of the Dynegydirect portal. The company said
that DynegyDirect would be reactivated when the market stabilizes and when
energy demand justifies the use of the site. Dynegy said it will continue
to trade with customers in North America and the UK by telephone and that
it would honor any online trades executed through June 19th. DynegyDirect
provided its 2,300 users with real-time information on over 750 products
and services including power, natural gas, natural gas liquids and coal.
Dynegy was a counter-party to each trade made on Dynegydirect, similar to
the way EnronOnline operated. Traders said users were forced to limit
their exposure amid growing doubts about the company's liquidity.
EnronOnline was shutdown just days before the company filed for
bankruptcy, leading some to speculate that the same fate may be in store
for Dynegy. However, others in the industry point out that the closure is
consistent with Dynegy's recent reorganization efforts. The company has
announced a number of steps it intends to take to improve its balance
sheet and liquidity in hopes of reassuring investors and credit rating
agencies. On Wednesday, Dynegy cut about 6% of its workforce, including
about 50 members of its trading unit, and announced the replacement of its
chief financial officer. ChevronTexaco owns 26.5% of Dynegy and has pumped
billions of dollars into the company. Many are now watching ChevronTexaco
to see what role it intends to play in Dynegy's future.

Perot Systems Provides Data to California State Senate Committee

    Perot Systems has sent 5 boxes of data to California officials who are
investigating the company for allegedly providing energy traders with
information on how to exploit the states flawed deregulated power market.
The information includes 10,000 pages of presentations, e-mails and
letters related to Perots attempts to sell its energy services and
software. The Perot Systems documents, some of which have been posted on
its Web site, will also be filed with the SEC, the company said. Perot
Systems has retained former FERC economist and author, Steven Stoft, to
review its California dealings. H Ross Perot has agreed to testify before
the California Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation
of the Wholesale Energy Market on July 11th. According to the head of the
committee, after Perot Systems built information technology systems for
the California ISO and the California Power Exchange, the company gave
Reliant and Enron tips on how to manipulate the flawed California power
market, while trying to sell them energy services and software. Neither
company had any significant dealings with Perot Systems, which has denied
any wrongdoing. Perot said the discussions contained in a document
provided by Reliant were based on publicly available information and the
problems were corrected before California's deregulated market opened in
April, 1998. The state senate committee chairman said he intends to seek a
subpoena for additional documents to ensure there are no omissions in the
materials delivered yesterday. California's governor has forged ahead with
a request that the FERC launch an investigation into Perot Systems, in an
attempt to find deeper pockets from which to seek refunds than those of
bankrupt Enron.

Plumbing Mystery of Deals by Enron 
 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 
T the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corporation (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE >) are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers.
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to "hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies.
Q. How did those investments do?
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that.
Q. Why can't that be discerned?
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely.
Q. Why were they so complicated?
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back - whether for $1 or $50 - there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet - in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule.
Q. Who made money from these transactions?
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors.
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important.
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships.
Q. How did Enron do?
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
Q. How did that happen?
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated "previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods." Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings.
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

We are trying to match up the March 02 Ponderosa prepays with what is
currently in GasMaster and the two numbers do not equal.  Did they prepay
more than the nominated March deals?  Also could you confirm whether the
following are all the prepays that we received from Ponderosa.

That sounds very nice, especially the part about everyone loving me.  There's only one problem, I don't like work any more than you do, probably less.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Natural Gas Futures Rally

    Natural gas futures jumped sharply higher yesterday following the AGA report of a 99 Bcf increase in natural gas storage last week, below market expectations. Prices slumped early as traders awaited the release of the inventory data. The July contract gained $0.171 to $3.981 per MMBtu. August climbed $0.162 to $4.055 per MMBtu. Some traders are not convinced the rally, which saw the market climb $0.30 from the Wednesday trading low, is for real. El Paso was a large seller yesterday, but they got taken out by Enron buying. Look for the market to open even higher this morning as it takes out $4.00. Natural gas prices for next day delivery across the US and Canada were generally lower yesterday, except in the west where spot prices continue to rise sharply. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.17 to $3.66 per MMBtu.

California Governor Gives FERC 30 Days to Act or Else

   Californias governor says he will give FERC at least 30 days to take steps to help solve the state's energy crisis before going forward with the lawsuit he has been promising. His vow to file his own lawsuit against FERC follows a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Tuesday to deny a similar lawsuit filed by two state legislative leaders. That lawsuit said FERC was failing in its legal duty to ensure just and reasonable energy prices in California. But the federal appeals court said the legislators had failed to demonstrate court intervention was warranted. The governors spokesman said the cop needs to be on the beat and not hiding behind some false ideology that is not relevant, evidently referring to capitalism. The governor also said the federal government should order refunds of 40% to 50% to send a strong signal to energy companies in Texas and in the South to stop bleeding us dry, stop taking us to the cleaners, and charge reasonable rat!

FERC Chairman Defends Record

    FERC Chairman Hebert has defended his agency against charges by California's governor that it has failed to act on the state's power crisis, and said lawsuits to make the FERC impose price caps would likely be a waste of time and money. Hebert says he feels good about winning any legal challenge by anyone from California. He also noted FERC has issued a price mitigation plan for California, which would help ease the power shortage crisis if the state would just cooperate.

Massey Calls for Change in Market Power Definition

    FERC Commissioner Massey, dissenting from two orders, strongly called for the commission to revise its current method of market power analysis, saying it is just plain outdated, inadequate and unreliable. Massey says the hub-and-spoke method of market power analysis, which presumes market power if any single market participant holds a 20% market share, does not work. In April, PG&E and SCE asked FERC to deny renewal of market-based rate authority to Williams Energy Marketing and Trading, saying that while Williams controls less than 20% of the generation resources in the state, it is still able to exercise market power. To renew its market-based rate authority, Williams should perform an analysis of market power using other means, the utilities said. Massey says the events of the California wholesale power market, where no single power seller holds close to 20% market share during the past year, demonstrate that market power can be exercised by any player holding a much !
sm!
aller piece of the market.

Metcalf Power Plant Set for Approval

    San Joses mayor, a vocal opponent of a proposed 600 MW, natural gas fired power plant planned for California's Silicon Valley, has reversed course and accepted an agreement that should pave the way for the project's approval. Facing an onslaught of pressure, the mayor announced a compromise with project developers. Most California officials support the project, including the state's mainline environmental groups the governor. Computer networking giant, Cisco Systems, which plans to build an office complex near Metcalf for 20,000 employees, has fought the plant. Three main points in the agreement that had been problems for Cisco: * The time it takes to shutdown the plant for maintenance and start it up again will be cut by 25% during the first five years to further reduce emissions. * Calpine agreed to set up two new air-monitoring stations near Metcalf that will be independently monitored to ensure it is meeting strict emissions requirements. * Calpine will adopt technol!
og!
ies reducing or eliminating the use of liquid ammonia as soon as these systems are approved by state regulators and are proven economically feasible. Metcalf will also offer long-term power contracts at competitive prices for San Jose businesses. The plant has taken on symbolic value, and industry analysts say the outcome will be a key sign of how the state will deal with its power crisis. Metcalf would be the first major power plant built in Silicon Valley in 20 years.

Land and Mineral Development LLC., Vienna, West Virginia, owns 85,000 acres of mineral rights in Southeastern West Virginia. The first Trenton/Blackriver production found in the state, was in a well drilled in 1962 by Tidewater Oil Company adjoining our property. We need an industry
partner. Geophysicist report and other information available.  The 85000 acres would also make a great gas storage field.

We also have another small storage field for sale near the new Trenton Wells.

Energy Companies Using More Credit Derivatives

   Energy companies are using more credit derivatives both to hedge existing risk and make money by trading them, and need to adjust their risk management strategies to compensate, according to a report by Standard & Poor's. Many energy trading firms are augmenting their credit risk management practices through the use of credit derivatives, while others attempt to profit by trading credit derivatives, the report says. Credit derivatives are contracts that let companies transfer credit risk. Buying them works like insurance against a company going bankrupt, paying out if a trigger event occurs. Companies trading energy commodities such can use financial derivatives as a hedge. Enron is one of the heaviest traders of credit derivatives as a market maker.

Conoco to Help Arctic Pipeline Plans

    Conocos takeover of Gulf Canada Resources should add political power to the plans of a group of major oil companies to build a natural gas pipeline from Canada's Arctic, according to Gulf's CEO. Conoco has offered C$12.40 per share in cash for Gulf. Gulf's partners in the study of the C$3 billion pipeline include Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Exxon Mobil. Gulf has an estimated 1.3 Tcf of natural gas reserves in the region. Last week, the group negotiated an agreement with native leaders from the Northwest Territories that would have the Aboriginal Pipeline Group owning up to a third of the pipeline. Debate has long centered on whether a pipeline from northern Alaska or the Mackenzie Delta would be built first, or whether the market could initially support both.

The spreadsheet for Nov. does not have any demand expense listed for Tetco. The Service P/L report shows demand cost on contracts 895829 and 895835, deal numbers 1146868 and 1146936.

Do you need to update spreadsheet?

Thanks,
BF

Big football weekend in Western New York.  People have bounties out for Flutie's head!  The local radio station is having a bon fire to throw Flutie Voo Doo Dolls into tonight!

Excess injections and IAS is available for the weekend.

No excess withdrawal's.  All of you firm shippers are resisting withdrawing gas.  All of you who owe us gas can blame them, NOT me.

Although I space through Concord, Niagara is full for IT for the weekend.

You have an electronic contract awaiting your review and execution.  Use the Execute Electronic Contracts screen to print and electronically execute a Request(s) for service

To Print/Execute Electronic Contracts:

1. Click on the Contracts folder
2. Select the Execute Electronic K from the Contract Administration Drop Down menu
3. Select the service requester from the Service Requester drop down menu
4. Choose the print option of either View Later or E-mail.
 4a. If View Later is selected then the contract can be printed from the Utility

 4b. If Email is selected then the contract will be emailed to the address
     displayed in the Email Address Field. This field will default to the email
     address currently associated with the Navigator Id that is currently logged
     on the system. You may change the designation of where the contract is
     to be sent by typing in a different email address
5. Click on Retrieve
6. To print a contract, place a check in the Print Contract select box beside the Bid/Request No. that you want to print
7. To execute your contract, place a check in the Execute select box beside the Bid/Request No. that you want to execute. Note: It is strongly recommended that you print your contract prior to execution.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd 
Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd 
Thu 	11/22 	65 Bcfd 
Fri 	11/23 	62 Bcfd 
Sat 	11/24 	61 Bcfd 
Sun 	11/25 	62 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/26 	64 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/27 	63 Bcfd 
Till tomorrow, 
The Weather Team

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Here's what Stan wrote: 
Regarding instruments playing different notes - yes, some instruments are called transposing instruments; they play notes differently from the way they appear on the score.  That's why an orchestral score may have a line for "Trumpets in B-flat."  When those trumpeters see a C on the score, they actually play a B-flat.  To get them to play a C, the score has to show a D.
  
Trumpets (and other brass and reed instruments) come in different sizes.  The notes in the score tell the musician what fingering to use.  A trumpeter will use the same fingering to play C on a C trumpet as they would use to play B-flat on a B-flat trumpet.  But in both cases the score will be notated as C.
  
Of course, this is a hassle for composers, who have to think backwards to be able to get the right sounds from the musicians.  In fact, some 20th century composers finally said to heck with this, my score is going to show concert pitch for all instruments.  So for those scores the musicians have to figure out the transpositions themselves.
  
Now there's notation software which can handle transposition and make everyone's job a lot easier.  So my guess is, new music will probably continue the old practice of transposing.

Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance


November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Natural Gas Futures Up Slightly; Cash Slips

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX ended higher Friday on pre-weekend short-covering, but closed off its highs after failing to break above resistance at $4.00 per MMBtu. In early trading, prices slid to the lows of the day, but short-covering by trade and commercial accounts lifted prices once it became clear they would fall no further. The July contract settled up $0.016 at $3.93 per MMBtu. August rose $0.019 to $4.009 per MMBtu. With only moderate warmer weather conditions forecast, the upward price momentum was lost. Rumors that the AGA was going to revise last weeks storage report lower, sparked some buying and prompting short covering. Last week the AGA reported an injection of 99 Bcf, and the rumors suggested that number could be dropped to the mid-80s. This rumor was later reported to have been false, sparking the return to selling. Look for generally mild to warm weather conditions across most of the nation this week. California will continue to be hot this week. !
Ma!
ny traders are expecting the market to test $3.50 this week. Resistance is seen at $4.05, then $4.25; with support at $3.80, followed by $3.67. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally mixed to $0.10 lower last Friday. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub dipped $0.04 to $3.73 per MMBtu.

California ISO Protests RTO Filing

    The California ISO has has agreed, under protest, to FERCs demand from that it file to create a RTO, while maintaining the requirement is illegal and inappropriate. The ISO faced a June 1st deadline to file a RTO plan or risk losing FERC-backed emergency price controls. The ISO claims that it is not legal or appropriate to condition price controls on anything. So far, there are 2 RTOs planned for the western US. RTO West is mostly based in the Pacific Northwest and Desert Star mainly consists of Southwest utilities. FERC would like to see just one RTO in the western region. The filing called for the ISO itself to become a third western RTO, a move that would appear to make little practical difference to the running of the agency. FERC Chairman Hebert has said it was necessary to require California to join at RTO, claiming no price relief plan could open clogged transmission systems and build new infrastructure. The FERCs price relief plan, which is only imposed during pe!
ri!
ods when the ISO has declared a power emergency, requires generators to offer available electricity in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery. The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highest-cost generator asked to supply power to the grid.

Edison Rescue Plan May Fall Apart

    The rescue agreement between the state of California and Southern California Edison may fall apart because the PUC is not ready to implement parts of it by a June 8th deadline. Edison International says the agenda for a June 7th meeting lacks items that have to be implemented by the following day. Failure to implement those items would give either Californias DWR or SCE the right to back out of the agreement which calls for the state to buy Edison's share of the power grid for $2.76 billion. Collapse of that agreement may force SCE into bankruptcy. Shares of Edison closed up $0.17 Friday at $11.00, but have fallen 30% this year.

Democratic Senate and Bush Energy Plan on Collision Course

   The energy agenda of the new Democratic-controlled Senate is about to clash with the Bush administration on electricity price caps for California, drilling in Alaskan and  soaring gasoline prices. While President Bush favors more drilling and coal use as part of a national energy policy, many Democrats prefer increased conservation and stricter mileage standards for vehicles to save fuel. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has already been declared dead by new Senate Majority Leader Daschle.. Democratic lawmakers are expected to push for higher gasoline mileage for sports utility vehicles as part of the solution. The National Academy of Sciences is due to issue a report in July on possible higher vehicle fuel standards. The administration has said it will wait for that report before deciding what to do with current fuel requirements. Currently, US autos must average 27.5 miles per gallon, but light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles are required to avera!
ge !
20.7 miles per gallon. The US market uses about 20 million barrels per day. The biggest fight with the administration is expected to come over the issue of price caps on power sales in California. As the state prepares for rolling blackouts this summer, Senate Democrats plan to move forward with legislation requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose temporary price caps in western states. Senate Democratic lawmakers also plan a new probe of the energy industry's record profits.

On May 18yh, Saudi Arabia awarded Enron, Occidental and ExxonMobil stakes in the Red Sea natural gas package, one of three projects on offer under the kingdom's $25 billion natural gas development opening. ExxonMobil will retain the lead role, with 60%, while both Marathon and Occidental will have 20% interests. Last month, Enron also bowed out of Dolphin Energy, which is majority owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates and beginning a $3.5 billion project to transport Qatari natural gas to the UAE.

Mirant Leery California Power Plans

    Just days after California approved construction of a 530 MW power plant, Mirant says it does not know when it would begin to build the $275 million facility because of uncertainty about the state's energy market. Mirant is concerned about speculation among California officials that the state should impose a windfall profits tax on energy companies and seize power plants. Last week, the governor praised the plant, saying it was the 16th major generating facility licensed during his 2 years in office, bringing the overall number of new MW approved to 10,400. The plant would be built at Mirant's Contra Costa generating facility northeast of SF.

Emissions trading options are ripe for the picking - so how can you make
sure you're ready to profit from GHG?  Let's face it - you can't really

international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per
annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how
you can best seize this exciting nwe market opportunity.  As ever, the
conference will be driven by the industry leaders in this arena, backed up
by expert advice from those helping the indsutry make the right moves in

* Weather Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Today's business is all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather
derivatives has become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging at
utilities, airlines, and agriculture have at hand to off-set risks
associated with temperature and precipitation.  With over 70% of Europe's
companies facing weather-related risk, knowing about the latest advances in
weather trading is a necessity.

Eyeforenergy's latest event will be run in conjunction with our European
online trading conference, Energy Trading in the New Economy, and
Eyeforenergy's Emissions Trading 2002 event, so you can learn about the
latest developments in energy and emissions trading all under one roof.

* The Business of Fuel Cells for Transportation
  Dearborn Hotel, Detroit, Michigan
  April 30 - May 1, 2002

As manufacturers are increasingly developing technologies with the energy
industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.

     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

I trust everyone had a nice Thanksgiving (US customers).  The weather sure did cooperate with a long weekend if you weren't too long on gas?!

We have NO excess injections available for the East or West side.

I have 120,000 dth available through Concord today.  The backhaul from Leidy to Niagara looked attractive to me this morning.

NO IAS OR ISS injections.

ISS is unavailable today.  The warmer weather is resulting in our LDC injecting at their maximum level.

IT is available and the numbers from this morning show $.06 spread between Niagara and points "close"  to Leidy.  I'm using Dominion Appl.  Let's see what happens during the morning.  I have capacity up to 100,000.

IAS has a meager $.025 spread over the winter:(.

Is everyone else as bearish on prices as Salomon Smith Barney?

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

If you have any further questions, please contact Pete Castrejana at 713-410-0642 for more information.

MEET ME IN THE STAIRWELL

      You say you will never forget where you were when you heard the
 news on September 11, 2001. Neither will I.

    I was on the 110th floor in a smoke filled room with a man who
 called   his wife to say "Good-Bye." I held his fingers steady as he
dialed.

    I gave him the peace to say, "Honey, I am not going to make it,
but  it  is OK...I am ready to go."

    I was with his wife when he called as she fed breakfast to their
    children. I held her up as she tried to understand his words and
as  she realized he wasn't coming home that night.

    I was in the stairwell of the 23rd floor when a woman cried out to
 Me  for help. "I have been knocking on the door of your heart for 50
    years!" I said. "Of course I will show you the way home -- only
    believe in Me now."

    I was at the base of the building with the Priest ministering to
the  injured and devastated souls. I took him home to tend to his Flock
 in  Heaven. He heard my voice and answered.

    I was on all four of those planes, in every seat, with every
prayer.   I was with the crew as they were overtaken. I was in the very
hearts  of the believers there, comforting and assuring them that their
 faith   has saved them.

    I was in Texas, Kansas, London. I was standing next to you when
you  heard the terrible news. Did you sense Me?

    I want you to know that I saw every face. I knew every name --
 though not all know Me. Some met Me for the first time on the 86th floor.

    Some sought Me with their last breath.
    Some couldn't hear Me calling to them through the smoke and
flames;

    "Come to Me...this way...take my hand." Some chose, for the final
    time, to ignore Me. But, I was there.

    I did not place you in the Tower that day. You may not know why,
but   I do. However, If you were there in that explosive moment in time,
    would you have reached for Me?

    September 11, 2001, was not the end of the journey for you. But
    someday your journey will end. And I will be there for you as
well.   Seek Me now while I may be found. Then, at any moment, you know
you  are "ready to go."

    I will be in the stairwell of your final moments.

    God

    OUR FATHER

    During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are doing, and take
 this
    opportunity. (Literally it is only 1 minute)

    All you have to do is the following:

    You simply say and "Our Father" for the person that sent you this
    message:

    Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom
 Come,
    Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day
our
    daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
    trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us
    from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
 forever
    and ever AMEN.

    Next, you send this message to everyone you know. In a while, more
    people will have prayed for you and you will have obtained a lot
of
    people praying for others.

    Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life, for
    doing what you know is pleasing to Him. If you are not ashamed to
do
    this, follow the instructions.

    Jesus said, "If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you
 before
    My Father."

    If you are not ashamed, send this message ... only if you believe.

    "Yes, I love my God. He is my fountain of Life and My Savior. He
    keeps me going day and night. Without Him, I am no one. But with
    Him, I can do everything. Christ is my strength."

    This is a simple test. If you love God and you are not ashamed of
 all
    the great things that he has done for you, send this to everyone
you
    know, and the person that sent it to you.

    AMEN, and God Bless Us All.....

   Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference -
   some
   people call some days and not the next.  Kathy has called on Saturday
   and
   Sunday for intraday rates.

   I will go back and make corrections for you on the 14th.  How much
   volume?

   I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in
   my
   system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate
   it
   AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on
   days
   after the 14th
   AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
   forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

   Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't
   worry
   about it.

   Thanks

      Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to
   Carnes
      on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
      would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in
   my
      notes.

      Thanks

Is today going to be a busy day?  I can't believe a FORECAST of possible future cold weather can move the market like it did yesterday.  Is that because I'm so green in this business?  Or is something else going on?

AGA?  Over or under 60Bcf?

IT through Concord is available for 30,000 dth.

Due to some cold weather I have room for excess injections on the East Side 30,000 dth, West Side 10,000 dth.

Excess withdrawals' or IAS system wide up to 100,000dth.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

Chris,

The New Power Company deal #649352 has a demand charge (income) of $1,183,732 that you added.  Do they owe us this money and how is it related to this deal.
I looked in your demand charge spreadsheet to see if we reflected it in our P&L through a reimbursement but am unable to find it.

Your help and input would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks

Kam

Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my
notes.

Thanks

I'm going to see Harry Potter this week.  It's two one half hours long.   You
want to go?   Barb does not want to go with me.    I'll come up to Houston to
see it.  Need to pick up a honey cured ham anyway.  If you do not want to go, no
sweat.   I was thinking about going tonight anyway.

Short week!!!

Our open season for firm transportation from Pendleton to Elliisburg ends today.  Please call you firm services rep if you are interested or have any last minute questions.

I have 75,000 dth of excess on-system deliveries.  On-system deliveries include injections into storage and deliveries to the City Gate.  We believe that injections are going to prove tight since our distribution marketer's and LDC will probably serve their load with on system deliveries, not from removing gas from storage.  Therefore, I am not recommending you make excess injections into storage unless you have a secondary place to move the gas to if we get into a curtailment period tomorrow.

I have 80,000 through Concord.  The back haul spread looked very favorable this morning.  Call me if you are interested in using the path on the intra day or for tomorrow's gas day.

I'm disappointed the Bills game wasn't on TV yesterday.  It was 60 degrees and sunny.  We lost by three but Van Pelt showed up and played a "good" game.  My 14 point spread may have been slightly pre mature, maybe next week?

Hey,
Think positive, all the blessings you have received in the last 12 months.  You
don't think the Good Lord is watching over you.    I bet when all the dust
settles, you are still at Enron.   You do know how to make coffee right?

    Natural gas on the NYMEX closed lower yesterday, but the market found
support and bounced off intra-day lows. Pressure from high storage builds
and mild weather across the eastern half of the nation pushed the market
down from Wednesday's gains. Early losses were offset by fund and managed
account purchases as well as stop loss buying, but prevailing floor
sentiment prompted local and short-term traders to sell near the end of the
session. The July contract dipped $0.067 lower to $3.914 per MMBtu, after
rallying as high as $4.075 in after-hours Access trading following the
Wednesday's AGA report of a 99 Bcf injection last week. August lost $0.65 to
$3.99 per MMBtu. Total storage inventories are at 1.281 Tcf, 7 Bcf more than
a year ago, but about 27 Bcf below the 5-year average. The year-on-year
storage surplus was the first since January 2000. August futures lost $0.065
to $3.99 per MMBtu. Look for the market to open lower this morning as it
remains under pressure until hotter weatheris forecast or fear of a Gulf of
Mexico hurricane appears. Technical support is expected at $3.69 per MMBtu,
with resistance at $4.29. Morgan Stanley Research estimates new US
production will be 51.4 Bcf per day in 2001, compared with 49.6 Bcf per day
in 1999. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally $0.05  $0.15 per MMBtu higher yesterday. Western prices continued
to jump higher. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained
$0.11 to $3.77 per MMBtu.

ANR Cuts HIOS Volumes; Mainline Work Planned

    ANR Pipeline says volumes from the High Island Offshore System and West
Cameron near shore blocks have been reduced by 40 MMcf per day due to
compression outages at Grand Chenier. The reduction began Wednesday and will
remain in place until further notice. ANR is also planning to perform
pipeline maintenance on its Southeast Mainline beginning June 4th and
continuing through July 6th. The work will reduce capacity by 195 MMcf per
day from June 4th  10th, 225 MMcf per day June 11th  12th, and by 60 MMcf
per day June 13th  24th. June 25th  26th, capacity will be reduced by 140
MMcf per day and by 220 MMcf  per day from June 27th to July 3rd. The work
will cut capacity by 25 MMcf per day from July 4th  6th. ANR's system
consists of 10,600 miles of pipeline and 74 compressor stations with a
design peak capacity of about 6.6 Bcf per day.

Guardian to Change Eminent Domain Procedures

    Guardian Pipeline has decided to change its approach to the eminent
domain procedures. Instead of using federal eminent domain statutes,
Guardian will now follow Wisconsin state procedures, a move that should help
appease  landowners. A group of landowners had contested FERC's decision to
certify the project, claiming to be misled about Guardian's plans for using
eminent domain.

Mexico Natural Gas Expansion Behind Schedule

   Mexico's natural gas expansion is behind schedule despite the foreign
companies Gas Natural, Gaz de France and Tractebel having met their
investment targets. The contractors have been unable to complete works on
time, bureaucracy has been excessive and natural gas prices have been
volatile. In mid-2000, Gas Natural bought Comercializadora Metrogas and is
now market leader committed to investing $428 million by 2004.

Iroquois Recognized for Safety Record

    Iroquois Pipeline has been honored by the American Gas Association,
receiving their annual Safety Achievement Award for the 4th time. The AGA
honored 64 member companies during their Annual Operations Conference in
Dallas. "We take pride in our strong safety record, and in the emphasis each
of our employees places on personal and operational safety," said the
company president. The award honors companies who surpass the standards for
injuries and illnesses set by the OSHA. AGA members invest millions of
dollars each year to maintain an outstanding safety record and AGA honors
companies that are setting the pace in the important area of accident
prevention and workplace safety. Iroquois Gas Transmission System is the
owner of an interstate pipeline extending 375 miles from the US-Canadian
border at Waddington, NY, through the state of Connecticut to South Commack,
Long Island, NY. It has added two short lateral lines, several meter
stations and three compressor stations at Wright, Croghan, and Athens, NY.

AEP Plans Trade Mission to Mexico

    Companies interested in exploring business opportunities in Mexico are
invited to participate in a trade mission that American Electric Power will
sponsor September 10th  14th. AEP, through its Going Global export
assistance program, will lead visits to Monterrey and Mexico City.
Participants will meet one-on-one and in small groups with representatives
of Mexican companies that want to do business with US firms. We have helped
nearly 70 companies develop sales in the Mexican market, says the
international development manager who heads the program. The US provides 74%
of Mexico's imports. Dozens of companies have found these trade missions a
cost-effective method to evaluate market potential and develop sales. AEP
launched Going Global in 1994 to help small to medium-sized businesses
develop and increase export sales of their products and services. The
registration deadline for the Mexico trade mission is July 17th.

Experts Say Build More California Power
Plants and Ensure Competition

    As the Bush Administration continues to face harsh criticism in
California over perceived inaction regarding the energy crisis, industry
executives appear to be lining up behind Bush's assertion that enhancing the
availability and reliability of the nation's energy supply is the long-term
solution. And they consider creating more supply while maintaining the
transition to a deregulated marketplace crucial, reports the May issue of
Energy Competition Strategy Report, published by Atlanta-based NHI
Publications. One leading utility executive says the solution to the
nation's long-term supply problem is inescapable. "We need to build new
power plants. And those new plants will be built only if we allow the
competitive market to do its job," says William Hecht, chairman, president,
and CEO of Allentown, PA-based PPL Corp. Price caps - which California is
pushing for and Bush opposes - "reduce the incentive to invest in new
production and unnecessarily prolong and exacerbate the current supply and
demand mismatch," Hecht adds. PPL is aggressively developing new power
plants in Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Arizona that
will add more than 4,000 MW of supply. Other members of the Washington,
DC-based Electric Power Supply Association, such as ABB Energy Ventures of
Switzerland and Zeigler Coal Holding of Ashland, KY, are building new,
unregulated merchant power plants. Meanwhile, EPSA is asking Congress to
enact legislation that would allow federal eminent domain for transmission
siting and establish a standardized interconnection policy to make it easier
for generation companies to "get onto the grid." Other highlights of this
month's Energy Competition Strategy Report include: A new energy market
study finds that despite several major setbacks, including California's
ongoing crisis, the energy industry still has its sights set on achieving
full competition. Retail Energy Markets, produced annually by Xenergy, a
Burlington, MA, research firm, is featured in the report and includes a
wealth of data suggesting that, despite restructuring problems, the shift to
competition continues. - Get a detailed look at PowerSolution, a core
technology platform that helps energy companies manage their data by
integrating business applications, external trading partners, and legacy
systems. - Regional utilities are forging loyalties with big commercial and
industrial chains through National Accounts programs that provide
value-added, one-stop customer service. Award-winning Southern Co shares its
secrets to success. - Can fuel cells meet the growing demands for
electricity? A large energy company plans to build, operate, and maintain an
electric generation plant that will use six fuel cells to generate primary
electric supplies. - Evaluate opportunities for investment. Use this process
to assess whether any of 700 technologies spanning the energy value chain
are appropriate investments. Free 3-month trial subscriptions to Energy

Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference - some
people call some days and not the next.  Kathy has called on Saturday and
Sunday for intraday rates.

I will go back and make corrections for you on the 14th.  How much volume?

I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my
system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry
about it.

   Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
   on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
   would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd

Tue	11/27	65 Bcfd

Till tomorrow,

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order ("OFO") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

The past six months certainly have been challenging for all of us at Enron.  With so much change and uncertainty, stress is inevitable.  To help employees better manage stress, Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will sponsor Brown Bag sessions on Tuesday, July 9 and Thursday, July 18 from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the Enron Building, EB5C2.  The group's size for each session will be limited to maximize dialogue, so register early to guarantee a seat.  If necessary, additional Brown Bag sessions will be scheduled to accommodate demand.

To register for one of the scheduled sessions, please click on the appropriate date button above.  If you have questions about the sessions, please contact Linda Hallmark at 713-345-3592.

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.

Robin,

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon.  We have not heard back yet.  We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc.  I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party.  Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations?  I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Thanks again for your help.

Christy

Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi.  The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB.  I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record.  EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale.  If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement.  I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read:  Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

Robin,

How are you doing?  It has been a few years since we've seen each other.
John Fitzpatrick asked that I send to you the GISB contract for your review.
If you will complete the information on the right-hand side of the first
page and email back to me I will prepare originals for execution.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Happy Friday......

Can any of you believe this McVeigh debacle?!

The only ISS available today and through the weekend is down hole transfer capacity at Ellisburg.

IT is available for the foreseeable future, that being the next few days.  Unfortunately we are not seeing the geographic arbitrage opportunity on the Niagara to Leidy path.  If some of you have attractive commodity prices along that path I am willing to discount the tariff IT rate to help you move it on our system.

Have a great weekend,

Natural Gas Futures Rally Above $4

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX jumped higher yesterday amid forecasts for above-average temperatures in Texas this week and revised predictions for warmer weather in July and August. The July contract gained $0.139 to $4.069 per MMBtu and August rose $0.142 to $4.151 per MMBtu. In spite of the price gain, it was a quiet day as none of the big players, Enron or El Paso, were very much involved. Industrial demand is on the rise again following weeks of declining natural gas prices was also seen as supportive. Some private forecasters have revised their summer predictions, and now believe July and August will be hotter than average. Summer forecasts have been changed to about 3  10 degrees above previous
prognostications. Forecasts hot weather in Texas this week also aided the rally. Also, last week's storage data may be a sign that industrial demand is increasing and utilities that switched to oil appear to be switching back, and the hurricane season has begun. However, the market is waiting for confirmation of the trend from tomorrows AGA storage report. If this weeks AGA injection number is 80 Bcf or less, the back of the bear could be broken, but most traders are expecting a much higher number. A rally to the $4.25 might encourage the funds to start covering their short positions. However, another triple-digit injection could keep the downtrend in place. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada jumped $0.20  $0.30 per MMBtu yesterday, driven by the futures rally. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.23 to $3.95 per MMBtu.

California PUC to Vote on Back QF Payments

     Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison would have to pay 15% of the money they owe to small power generators under an order to be voted on by the state PUC on Friday. But an organization representing the generators warned that approving the order would subject them to PUC regulation in addition to federal regulation, a problem they want to avoid. Many of the Qualifying Facilities have shutdown because they have not been paid hundreds of millions of dollars for power sold many months ago. Under an earlier PUC order, the utilities have been paying for QF power purchases since April and the small plants have been slowly returning to service. The order also proposes options for contract prices and incentive payments for excess power production by the QFs. The remaining debt would remain repayable, although the order says nothing about any future repayment schedule. The FERC ruled in May that the small power generators can sell electricity to third parties i!
f !
they have power available above and beyond the amount they need to meet their existing contractual agreements with the utilities.

House Energy Chairman Says Nation Facing Crisis

   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee says that the entire US is likely to face rolling blackouts like those plaguing California unless swift action was taken to build new power plants and increase natural gas production. He says the nation's high-tech economy could come to a crunching stop without an expansion of energy infrastructure and argued that government-imposed price caps would not provide a solution to high electricity prices. The EIA forecasts the will need 1,300  1,900 new power plants in the next 20 years to keep up with a projected 45% increase in demand.

California Largest State Economy

    A new report by the Commerce Department shows California makes up 13.2% of US economic output in 1999, the latest year for which data are available. That was well above the share of national economic output provided by the next largest state economies, New York at 8.1%, and Texas at 7.4%. From 1992 to 1999 California grew at a 3.9% annual rate, slightly higher than the 3.7% gain in national gross domestic product seen annually in the same period. Other Western states, including Nevada, Oregon and Washington all grew at a faster pace. Arizona, at a 7.3% annual rate of growth, was the fastest growing.

Deadline for PG&E Power Contracts Set

     A federal bankruptcy judge has ruled that PG&E has until June 29th to decide whether it will assume or reject energy contracts with a number of small generators who fear they will not be paid for future power. The judge also granted Calpine's request to postpone a hearing to determine whether the it can be released from its power contract until July 5th. If the judge allows Calpine and smaller Qualifying Facilities out of their contracts, they could sell their power for much higher prices on the spot market. But if PG&E assumes the QF contracts, it is required to immediately pay its pre-bankruptcy filing debts owed to them, totaling several hundred million dollars.

FERC Approves Hydropower Increase

   The FERC has approved a temporary increase in hydropower generation at the Priest Rapids Hydroelectric Project in Washington to help California avoid power shortages this summer. The commission will suspend rules on the spilling of dam waters during fish migration season this summer, allowing Priest Rapids to produce an additional 219,600 MWh of power. It is suspending part of an interim requirement which allows the licensee to spill water for 16 hours a day during the summer. It will allow for an exchange of spill and power with BPA, assuring flexibility and reliability to the regional grid and protecting listed fish species. The FERC is also seeking comment on an alternative plan that would suspend spill for an additional 8 hours per day, boosting generation to the region by 109,800 MWh. Hydropower accounts for 65% of the Pacific Northwest's electricity generation.

Westcoast to Expand Pipeline Capacity

    Westcoast Energy plans to expand it system by 250 MMcf per day of natural gas transportation capacity offered in two proposed pipeline expansions in western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. A recent open season to sell the capacity on the proposed pipeline expansions aimed at meeting a surge in demand from power plants was successful. Total volumes from both pipeline expansions, which could begin commercial service in 2003, would be more than enough supply for 1,500 MW of power generation. The expansions will link markets in the BC Lower Mainland and Pacific Northwest with supplies from BC, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. Westcoast is preparing to award 200 MMcf per day of expansion capacity on its Southern Mainline facilities to ten shippers with an average term of 27 years. It is also preparing to award 50 MMcf per day of new capacity on its Westcoast Alberta facilities to four shippers with an average term of 30 years.

NGI Reports June Natural Gas Prices Plummet

    Following on a month of mild weather with robust storage additions, natural gas spot prices for June dropped more than $1 from first-of-the-month May quotes at most points across the country, with the majority of prices coming in between $3.60 and $3.80. The June prices also were significantly below same time last year levels, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. The blockbuster turnaround was in California, where prices took a precipitous dive, led by a more than $4 drop in the Southern California-PG&E price to $6.77. While still high enough above the rest of the country to qualify as a separate market, the Southern California Border average of $11.70, fell from $14.64 in May. It didn't require a crystal ball to predict the price drop for June baseload gas, since prices had been steadily declining in the May after-market. The mild weather through much of the country, except California, and lack of air conditioning load has allowed eye-popping 100 Bcf-plus storage fill!
s !
for four weeks in a row. Storage levels, which had been below normal for more than a year, have climbed out of the basement, finally topping last year's levels in the survey for the week ending May 25th. As the storage fill level increased throughout May, the June futures contract declined, going off the board Tuesday at $3.738, or roughly $1.20 below the close of the May contract. A year ago all indexes, including California's, ranged from the $3.50s in the Rockies to the $4.60s in the Northeast. Now Northeast city-gates in the $4.10s lead the non-California pack, and Rockies prices have slipped below $3. The Henry Hub dropped from $4.89 last month to $3.73. June quotes were considerably below the winter bid-week highs registered in January of $16.32 at the Southern California border, $9.92 at the Henry Hub and $10.93 at the Chicago City-gate.

Natural Gas Futures End Up on Local Short-Covering 

    Natural gas for July delivery on the NYMEX settled up $0.021 Friday at
$3.237 per MMBtu, boosted by late short-covering by locals. The August
contract gained $0.018 to $3.294 per MMBtu. Weather forecasts today will
determine whether physical prices can rise to support any futures rally,
if not the market will likely test $3.00 this week. Spreads will dominate
the market the closer the July contract gets to expiration. Funds turned
dramatically short in most recent Commitments of Traders Report from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Crude oil prices for the new front
August contract fell $0.13 Friday to $25.82 per barrel, mostly on news of
Venezuela increasing production. Estimated natural gas volume was 70,000
contracts, with about a third spreads. Natural gas for weekend delivery
across the US and Canada was generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday. Natural
gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.12 to $3.17 per MMBtu.

Companies Consider Mexican Natural Gas Contracts

    Companies looking to enter Mexico's closed energy industry are
cautiously optimistic about the controversial 6-8 politically contested
multiple service contracts to produce natural gas in the Burgos basin on
the Texas border. Pemex plans to open a data room in November and says the
contracts would be finalized and the development blocks defined in
October. Pemex will offer the controversial multiple service contracts
individually in quick succession in November. The contracts would then be
evaluated by February and signed in March of 2003. However, the question
for the companies is whether the incentive of the deals compared to other
options around the world are great enough to warrant the investment. Under
the Mexican constitution, Pemex is not allowed to offer a percentage of
the commodity produced as payment to companies, because all natural
resources must remain in the hands of a government agency. In lieu of a
percentage, Pemex proposes payment for services according to a menu of
prices, but payment will depend on Mexico receiving income from natural
gas produced. Some big oil companies contend that scenario puts the burden
of risk on them, especially if natural gas prices plunge. The new
contracts will be renewable for up to 20 years instead of only 1 or 2
years. Opponents say they are a means of privatizing the country's oil and
natural gas industry, which was nationalized in 1938 and is widely
regarded as a symbol of Mexican sovereignty and economic independence.
However, a number of companies are interested in the contracts, some just
to get a foothold in Mexico's energy sector. But, there are also concerns
about the short amount of time allowed by Pemex between the opening of the
data room in November for seismic information and the award of bids in
February, because it forces companies into offering conservative bids.
Pemex indicated it might be open to extending the time frame.

NRC Cites Wisconsin Electric Nuclear Power Plant

    The NRC has ruled that Wisconsin Electric Power's 512 MW Point Beach 2
nuclear power plant will be cited with a 'low-to-moderate' safety
violation. The NRC says that on February 20th a pump in the unit's
emergency cooling system broke down because of a build-up of nitrogen in
pipes, which had leaked into the pipes from another part of the plant
emergency system. Point Beach is owned by Wisconsin Electric Power and
operated by Nuclear Management Co. The NRC called  the ruling a 'white'
finding in its four-color system for safety violations ranging in severity
from green to white, yellow and red for the most serious violations.
Nuclear Management did not contest the finding.

Williams to Eliminate Energy Trading Positions  

    Williams will eliminate 16% of its energy marketing and trading
positions this week as it adjusts to an industry decline. Last week,
Williams announced a plan to cut merchant energy jobs and other measures
to save $50 million a year. The company has about 800 US employees in its
trading and marketing unit and about 132 of those will lose their jobs
this week. Williams also laid off 11 traders, or 13% of its trading staff,
in London. The company has about 12,000 employees in total. The energy
trading sector is dwindling as governmental investigations and stricter
credit rating criteria erode investor confidence. Williams, El Paso Corp,
Aquila and many others have curtailed their trading and are selling assets
and stock to improve their balance sheets in a move to reassure investors
and credit rating agencies.  Williams has cut financing for its trading
unit by 33%. It plans to sell more than $1 billion in assets by the end of
2002, including refineries in Tennessee and Alaska, to raise cash and cut
debt. Williams' shares dropped $0.22 to $7.13.

Idacorp to Pull Back from Power Trading 

    Idacorp, a power utility with 700,000 customers in Idaho, Oregon and
Nevada, said it will gradually reduce its power trading business and
layoff about 60 employees as credit rating agencies tighten their
requirements for an investment grade rating in the energy trading
industry, thus reducing the number of credit worthy trading partners. The
sector is shriveling amid a myriad of governmental and regulatory
investigations into questionable trading practices and tougher standards
by rating agencies. Idacorp Energy will discontinue trying to attract new
customers, it said. The cuts, which will eliminate about 50% of the unit's
120 positions will be made over 18 months, and Idacorp will reduce working
capital for the business by 50% to $100 million. Dynegy announced last
week that it would close down DynegyDirect, its online trading platform,
due to the reduced number of power and natural gas trades amid industry
liquidity concerns. The decision will not have an impact on expected 2002
earnings of $1.35-$1.70 per share, Idacorp said. Analysts average
estimates are $1.46 per share. Idacorp Energy will lower its maximum value
at risk to under $3 million from $10 million. The unit had an average of
$1.4 million at risk and a high of $2.4 million in the 1st quarter. Shares
of Idacorp dropped $0.40 to $26.66 on Friday.

NEB Denies TransCanadas Rate Hike Request

    The National Energy Board has denied TransCanada PipeLines' bid to
increase prices on its main natural gas pipeline system. TransCanada
claims the hike is needed in order to remain competitive and help offset
the loss of long-term transportation contracts. TransCanada had asked the
NEB to change the way regulated tolls on its west-east pipeline system are
calculated to bring returns more in line with pipelines in the US.
Canadian natural gas producers are opposed to the plan, saying it would
require them to pay an extra $179 million to transport supplies. The NEB
decided to continue calculating tariffs using the same method, but raised
tolls minimally to compensate for increased business risks resulting from
new pipeline competition and an industry shift towards short-term shipping
contracts. TransCanada applied for an after-tax weighted average cost of
capital of 7.5%, up from 5.84% in 2001. If the proposal was denied,
TransCanada said it would seek a deemed common equity component of 40%, up
from 30%, providing a return on common equity of 12.5%, or about the same
as under the cost of capital proposal. Instead, the NEB decided to keep
its previous method of determining tolls in tact and it set a rate of
return for the mainline of 9.61% for 2001 and 9.53% in 2002. It also
raised the deemed common equity component to 33%, in effect increasing
tolls by 2% for the 2-year period.

Baker Hughes Weekly Rig Count

    The number of rigs searching for oil and natural gas in the US fell by
six to 838 last week, compared to 1,277 a year ago, according to Baker
Hughes. The number of rigs exploring in Canada was up 32 this week to 210,
compared to 305 a year ago. The number of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico was
flat at 105, compared to 154 a year ago. The number searching on land was
715, and the number of offshore rigs was at 110. There were 13 inland
rigs. The total North American rig count rose by 26 to 1,048, compared to
1,582 a year ago. The number of rigs searching for oil in the US rose by 5
to 139, and the number of rigs searching for natural gas fell by 11 to
698. There was one miscellaneous rig, unchanged from last week.

Credit Concerns Erode Energy Trading Business

    The shrinking natural gas trading industry in the US and Canada, amid
concerns over credit ratings and investor confidence, has made it
increasingly difficult to find buyers. After Aquila and Engage Energy
recently announced that they were closing their Canadian operations, the
gap in trading partners grew significantly. Some of Engage's operations
will be taken over by Duke's Canadian natural gas trading operation. Duke
acquired Engage as part of its $8.5 billion takeover of Westcoast Energy.
Traders say they are buying natural gas, but are having a hard time
turning it around because credit concerns have eroded the number of
companies they are currently allowed to deal with. Credit rating agencies
have indicated that energy trading companies may not qualify for an
investment grade rating due to the volatility of the sector. Last week,
Aquila said it was pulling back from the energy trading after cutting its
earnings forecast and dividend. Industry insiders say that Aquila was told
if they had a trading company, their credit would be downgraded, and if
they didn't, their investment grade rating would be maintained. However,
the shift away from energy trading could prove beneficial to electronic
trading platforms, in which participants have to clear credit requirements
before they can post any bids or offers. Also, the downturn in energy
marketing could leave the door open to a company with a good credit rating
and deep pockets to step in and grab a big share of the market right off
the bat. In addition, it is not likely such a company would encounter any
shortage of qualified traders, given the number of lay-offs in the field
lately.

I'm back......and have some opportunities to go with today's attractive prices.

IT - I can move gas all over the system, although the Niagara to Leidy doesn't look very attractive for this morning.

ISS - According to early reports from Dispatch, Niagara and East Aurora, have 75,000 dth available for injection today through Thursday, while Rose Lake has 50,000 available today and tomorrow.  Lamont has 20,000 available today and tomorrow.  Please call me to confirm any nom's.  The amount of excess availability is subject to change as the day goes on and the prices fall.

Down hole transfers at Ellisburg are 40,000 thru Thursday.

IAS isn't quite there yet.  The summer thru winter spread looks uneconomic.

I'm looking forward to making some deals today,

Abigail

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 18, 2001

Notice ID: 3193
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the
specified dates.

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.

Gumba!

What's cooking?  I work tomorrow.  Jerry can holler at me if  he wants.  How
are  you?  How did your back get?  I have not heard back from Gerald on the
tractor and lease.  I guess if he wants it that will be good.  If he does
not want it, I guess that will be good as well.
It is 4:30 and I am ready to depart from here in my room!  Keep your powder
dry and be safe!
