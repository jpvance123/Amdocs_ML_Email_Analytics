To all who will be doing the Morning Duty, please take some time to check that all the plasmas are operational.  You can either walk to all the plasma screens or just VNC to it to make sure everything is working.

Dutch left me a voice mail to ask if I can reset the Financial plasma.  Unfortunately, I was not here at 7AM.  

For future reference, would you (morning duty person) please monitor the plasma until I get here.
If you have problems getting the plasma up and running, please send email to my pager. 8774893520@pagenetmessage.net

Hi All,

I recently made a change to VolSmile.xls  to pick up the NT username versus the application(excel) username.  This change will not effect the functionalities of VolSmile.  I have deleted the User Name and Password in Sheets("Skew4"), since you will not need to enter a username/password.  The code will check your read/write access against your NT username.  Once again, the change will not effect any of VolSmile's original functionalilties.  Please refer to the attach file for usage.  If anyone has questions/comments concerning this change, please let me know.

Thanks Dutch.  I spoke with John Arnold yesterday and he said that we can assume that the deal verbally confirmed on Friday does not need to be done.  That is CSFB's position and unless you disagree we will leave it at that.

	To All,

	I am the one that was on the phone with the original call on the deal last Friday night and
	in contact with them up until this past Sunday. Let me know what I can do to help on this
	deal.

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

Dutch,

I am working on pulling together due diligence information for Global Finance in regards to ENA trading activity.  One number that stood out to us on the ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500MM.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting group, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for further insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about that settlement?

Thanks,
Ben

John,

As you are aware, there was some confusion on the 2 Peoples trades we did on 10/15/01.  We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.  

A person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn't a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn't know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn't know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn't confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven't talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.

Amy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).  So the trade is okay, but it could have been a $500,000 hit to Mike's book.

Please let me know if I can do anything.  Thanks.

John

Dutch,

Hopefully, you can help me.

PEC is currently short NYMEX NG LD Settlement Swaps with Enron North
America.
(See attached spreadsheet for volumes and prices).

PEC would like to terminate these swaps.
The current Mark-to-Market of these swaps is approximately $5.5 Million (in
favor of PEC).
PEC would like to negotiate the termination of these swaps and a payment
plan.

Thanks for your help,

On 12/3/2001 we put in a swap for: ENA Sell 7/month @ 3.261.  This matches a PMG confirm they sent us for a trade done on the 30th.  I see a futures sale of 7 @ 3.2610 w/ Paribas.  Let me know if I've got the right trade, and I'll flip it.

I'll be back around 1pm.

Today we received a letter from them.  How and when do you want to respond to this?  Has anyone called them?

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

Chris:
We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

On 12/3/2001 we put in a swap for: ENA Sell 7/month @ 3.261.  This matches a PMG confirm they sent us for a trade done on the 30th.  I see a futures sale of 7 @ 3.2610 w/ Paribas.  Let me know if I've got the right trade, and I'll flip it.

I'll be back around 1pm.
