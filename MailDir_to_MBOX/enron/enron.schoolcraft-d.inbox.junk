Attached is the preliminary CA monthly report for December for your review.  Please verify the following:

TK - The rates under Item 1 (especially those highlighted in pink, which I updated manually by reviewing invoices/transactional reports)
Darrell - The operational capacity and footnotes under Item 3
Terry - The scheduled and/or nominated volumes under Item 1 and 3 (I've done some cross-validations checks but another pair of eyes will help)
Jeanette - Overall data and format for accuracy

Please provide any comments to me no later than COB Monday, 1/21/02, for updates.  Once finalized, I will email to the full distribution list.

For the remainder of the Mops outage or until Gary or Darrell tell you otherwise, make sure that you select "FMJ" for every "CYCLE", while we are allocating. As this can and will cause confusion to the shippers and operators when they look at the posting on the EBB. As, we don't want the posting to be "Critical" one time and the next time "NOT Critical" the next. If you have questions, please ask. Thank you.

Ron,

To the best of my knowledge it should not cause any quality problems to compress Redfield to a common B-C discharge.  There could be some concern with responding to an H2S treater upset at Redfield, but the travel time for the gas to reach Ogden is long enough to divert any gas from Farmland Ft. Dodge.

But the B-C common/D split idea was just an alternate to a C-D common configuration.  As long as we can make a C-D configuration and Redfield compression work out, we would never have any need for a B-C common/D split out configuration

Since we talked Gas Control was able to common up the C and D north on 01/29/02 and it has been running that way ever since.  It looks to me like we should be able to stay with this through low flows (like this weekend) and high flows (like this morning).

At current Redfield capabilities in the 300 to 350 MM/D range, the order of compression from low flow to high flow would be:

		Flow North	Ogden						Ventura	

		<300		Redf to C-D north				Bypassed
		300-375		Redf to C-D north & East regulated to C-D	Bypassed
		375-425		Redf to C-D north & East regulated to C-D	C to C-D
		425-650+	Redf to C-D north & B-C-D to C-D north		C to C-D

The flow rate where the D would have to be split out from the C is pretty high.  I don't expect that we will see demands that high.

Of course at high rates the C-D common saves a lot of horsepower vs. the D only north, probably 2 - 3 units less to get the same suction pressure at Ventura.  At lower rates the net compression savings is not as strong.  But the advantages are running Ventura verticals to minimize Ogden horizontals as well as delivering higher a suction pressure to Owatonna.

Some thought following our telecon this AM. We probably don't want to consider running the
"B" & "C" North common & compressing Redfield into it. Wouldn't that cause some problems
with gas quality to Farmland on the "B"? Thanks..

York International will be in Monday Jan. 29 to begin preping the refrigerant compressor for transport.
There plan is to load the compressor on truck Monday the 4th of Feb. Yorks estimate for repair/test and 
back to us at 6 to 8 weeks. So we don't look for the compressor to be back till the 1st  week of April as long
as everything goes according to plans.

   Last week we had our annual Links meeting in Liberal to go over upcoming=
 outages this summer and coordinate them with Mobile & OXY (well testing) a=
nd Oneok ( field compression & Bushton Plant). The goal of the Links meetin=
g is to improve communications and coordinate outage so that we can have th=
e least amount of throughput loss for all. We also discuss any ideas that c=
an be improved on. One idea that Mobile brought up is they would like to ca=
ll into gas control in the morning around 6:30 to 7:00  and get an update o=
f any outages during the night in the Hugoton area that may have caused the=
m to be short on gas. They need this information so they can report in thei=
r marketing meeting so they can adjust noms. So if the central controller c=
ould start making notes of any outages in Hugoton during the night that aff=
ected flow and pass them on to the day crew they would have this informatio=
n to pass on and not have to look it up. This would be very helpful for Mob=
ile. They may not call every morning but we need to have the information wh=
en they do.

Thanks=20

Since NNG is allocating storage you may get a call from USGT wanting to bring gas into NNG from Transok or Oasis going to TW. If they do they will  get all  parties on the phone and make sure everyone agrees to start flow real time at receipt and delivery point. Also USGT would need to fax a nomination into gas control the following morning so that it is accounted for. (Like we do with Minnigasco) Be sure and log this and let your relief know so that we don't miss it the next morning.

I'm getting old!  Wondered why I couldn't find this is my sent folder.  Still in my draft folder.  Please review ASAP.

This will be sent to Steve Harris, Kim Watson, and Lorraine Lindberg once approved by the group.

Planning reviewed historical data and discussed with Gas Control this possibility of increasing the San Juan lateral south of Bloomfield by 10,000 MMbtu/d.  This would be accomplished by adding inlet air cooling to units #1 & 2 to reduce the ambient air to the turbine's combustion cycle which would increase available horsepower during the summer months.  This would allow TW to sell an additional 10,000 MMbtu/d year round.  However, there are a few issues to be addressed prior to Marketing making the decision of selling the 10,000 MMbtu/d on a long term firm basis.

1. This concept will only work during the hot months of the year (about 150 days).  Currently 10,000 MMbtu/d of LFT and/or IT is being sold during the cold months but the 
    inlet air coolers would allow for the capacity to be sold long term.
2. The additional volume through Bloomfield must come from the Hub.
3. There is currently an operational problem with the system efficiency from La Plata to the Blanco Hub which could have an effect on the total lateral capacity south of 
    Bloomfield.  A pigging project is scheduled for 2002 but may not be into operation before the inlet air coolers are in service.
4. Possibly would need to limit La Maquina flows during the overlap window from when the coolers are placed in service and the pigging project is complete (June - Aug.).

To reinforce the effect of the inlet air coolers, the conditions at Bloomfield now would be similar to this summer with the inlet air coolers with cooler ambient temperatures.  TW currently sells 10 MMbtu/d plus of LFT and/or IT.

The above is intended to give Marketing the necessary information to make a management decision to either approve or reject the proposed project.  Please inform Planning of your decision and we will release the appropriate group to proceed with the design and installation of the inlet air coolers.  A detailed cost estimate is being prepared along with the timing to install.  This information will be transmitted to the appropriate business units upon receipt and approval by Planning.

Ron Matthews

Attached is the preliminary January California monthly report for your review...our last one, yeah!!!

TK - Please review/verify the rates that I have highlighted in pink.

I have already spoken with Terry regarding 3 days where I noticed discrepancies between total scheduled in TMS vs website posting and have determined the correct number to report.  All other data looks very similar to previous reports filed.

Please provide any comments or updates that may be necessary by COB February 22nd.

 


Thanks,
Elizabeth

It is no longer necessary to inhibit the suction and discharge pressures at Seminole and Brownfield for correct Permian linepack.  These point have been enabled in the GUI.  If you have any questions call me at x31534.

D, 

Here are two San Juan outages the guys sent me. The date for Bisti is 04/12/02 for 12 hrs not 24. I put them in the system, and we can adjust the dates and flow affect as we need to. They were thinking that Gallop would be sometime after Station 4 overhauls are complete in May. I haven't heard about LaPlata yet.

 that our pagers still did not work.  Heather (Unity employee) told me they=
 see why they are not working and to give them 5 or 10 minutes and they wou=

Mike, I think we can go ahead and do the work. There is no flow affect right now, so I don't see a problem doing one unit at a time. Darrell what's your thoughts?

Here is a blank outage request form Mike.

Jerry

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Thanks
Mike

Jeanne,
In talking with Mark McConnell, Jerry Graves and Darrell Schoolcraft we think that if you can have David Duff pull the following point operational capacity out of TCI we can determine what Mark needs.  Please go back as far as you can in the database.  Some points may not exist because they were not in place back in 93 or 94, but pull as much history as you can. 
	Name			POI           
	SoCal - Topock		0056697
	SoCal - Needles		0010487
	PG&E - Topock		0056698
	S.W. Willow Valley	0013198
	N. Starsteel		0500383
	Mojave - Topock		0056696
	Citizen - Kingman	0056659
	Citizen - 89 North	0500046
	Citizen - Forest Branch	0500619
	Citizens - Flagstaff	0500134


Darrell, Jerry and I would like to validate the information prior to forwarding to Mark, so please send me the file and I will coordinate the review.  It might be helpful to know the field names in TCI if you can't find operational capacity.  We probably called it something different back then.

Thank you for your help.
Donna

Linda,
Here are two other points to update. Darrell told me that the BRI Jackrabbit poi # 500620 is active on TW, but not on Burlington's side. They are not set up to take the gas. It should be made inactive. Also poi 78161 & 500168 are the same point. We sum to poi 500168. So # 78161 should also be made not valid for Transport. 
Thanks Ramona

POI 500631 is an active, valid point in the San Juan Basin.  It has not started flowing as of yet.  It will stay in the groups it has been set up in until we are told otherwise by facility planning.

HL with Conoco let us know that the Zia plant will be down for maintenance Monday 28th for approximately 10 days.  They
plan to route some of the gas to the Maljamar plant.  I told them they would have to stay within TW tarrif specs of 7# of water.
They will watch it.

Chris, Lyndon returned your call regarding the above.  He is hearing the outage will not be concluded by this evening, probably not Thursday, maybe sometime Friday.  

However, there is a conference call at 11 a.m. this morning that you and Cara can conference in on -- 1-877-795-3687, code 6666 -- he said you could ask any further questions if any.

Perry and  Darrell,

Would you be able to attend a CAS overview with us tomorrow 9 - 10:30am?  Ramona is giving us the rundown on CAS - how it works, etc, and she would like for either or both of you to help tell us about CAS.

Thx, Jim

Guys,
	is there a way you can tell me what the MMBtu content of the gas is coming into TW from NorthWest Pipeline, TransColorado, and then what it is at Gallup?

I'm looking for historical info for say the last 6 months.

thanks

David, 
Here is our efficiency analysis from the online model.  This is just for the Bisti to Gallup section. The other sections have comparable results.
You can see that before the pigging the average efficiency were at 1.005 and after the pigging it rose to 1.04. Thus, a 4% increase in efficiency. However I see a gradual decreasing trend towards 1.035 just less than a week after the pigging.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Gallup, please provide digital pictures if possible and of course quantities of liquids and/or solids received.

Ben, I assume you be able to provide the post pigging effeciency on the lateral so we can continue to evaluate the timing of the DRA application?

Subject:	Travel Services


While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has

Karen,

OK, so I'm a little slow.  I am waiting for Darrell to get back with some additional information on Agave Dodd to verify the Lat ID and Mktg Lat ID, but here's what I see so far:

Because they are receipt points, the GRI indicator set at NO is ok since it's only applicable to delivery points
The supply basin for both should be changed from West Texas to Central
Verify which templates these points may have been added to and correct (s/b CE9REC)

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Gentlemen,
 I need to schedule 2 hrs. down time ( zero flow ) for sta. 010169-01 TW / TransColorado I/C ( Blanco Hub receipt ). Starting at 09:00 MST on 3-19-02.
We are going change out a 12" turbine meter out, and visually inspect the meter tube. Rick Downey with Kinder Morgan is scheduling this with his people as well. We should be able to make up the noms. pretty easily, as they always have plenty of line pressure and lots of gas.
Thanks,
Blackie

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Darrell

I was speaking with Linda Ward and she mentioned that there is displacement on POI 8042 PEPL Hansford Cactus.
This point is not showing in Model Office because in PLE is a delivery point, but it is currently in production as a valid receipt because it is part of the Panhandle all receipt template in CBS.  Call us Monday morning if we should be including this point as displacement SP group Panhandle.

Thanks



Maggie

Due to the large number of moves recently, many locations and phones numbers are incorrect in Peoplefinder.  If your information is incorrect, our HR staff has sent the instructions below on how you can correct your data.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call us.

Mail stop - this is how your paycheck (if your pay method is hard copy) and other mail comes to you.  Updates should be e-mailed by the employee or a department administrative assistant to Kenneth Mathews along with the person's P number.  Here is a link to a mail stop listing so that you can choose the correct mail stop:

	http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp?cabinet_id=127   Select number 10. Mail Stop Listing.

Room Location - this is the room number that shows up in directories such as Peoplefinder.  Updates should be done by the each employee by logging in to eHRonline and choosing "Work Contact Information", make the change and save.

Work Address (street address) - this information is located on eHRonline under "Work Contact Information" but cannot be updated by employees; this address does not effect where you get your mail (the mail stop does).  However, it is being updated through HR by the ISC; it will be sometime next week before the ISC loads this information into SAP due to some other delays; this will change the address in eHRonline from 333 Clay to 1400 Smith

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

I will then look at each individual contract and determine where they are delivering the gas to determine our commodity 
impact.

Thanks!

This plant will be shutting down effective April 1, 2002.  I will be working with Duke and Gary Spraggins to reduce their OBA imbalance to zero before this date.  Current OBA imbalance is 62,052 dth due Duke.

FYI,

On 02/11, Palmyra would like to pull the #3 power piston for inspection and installing a recondition power cylinder head. The work should take about a day. They will check with Gas Control on Monday before they start to get the OK...

Randy Lord with building maintenance advised us that HL&P had a switch problem that caused the Enron building to lose all commercial power. The UPS systems switched to the auxillary generators and there was minimal impact to the computer rooms and Gas Control Center during the outage. The backup chiller on the roof did not kick in automatically and building maintenance performed the switch manually. The computer rooms warmed up a bit, but not enough to be a problem. They plan to bring contractors in tomorrow morning to determine what the problem was with the backup chiller. The Gas Logistics business systems did lose one server but there was minimal to no business impact. Gas Control was not impacted. 

We will check with Randy tomorrow morning to see if HL&P has determined the root cause of their equipment failure. Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Gary Kenagy and Scott Abshire

Terry stopped by to ask that all of us look at the Gas Plan -- the portion listing our points, the monthly imbalance and the cumulative imbalance.  

Probably this is Scott mostly -- Scott has the Oasis, EPNG, Lone Star group & Valero interconnects, Cara has PEPL, Robert has KN Pony Express, and Chris has Halley.  In any event, please take a look at this summary page of the Gas Plan.  We need to be aware DAILY if these numbers that are coming across are fairly correct -- are we in the ballpark, etc.  

The example we can look at is Oasis -- we don't see how we could be short 620,000 cumulative at Oasis yet that's the number that is being reflected.  Scott is already tackling this one.  Terry said we need to get in touch with Dale Ratliff to get the numbers corrected.  And, we need to do this today.  This is a high profile item that Dynegy will be looking at.

Terry has asked that we make sure Gary is always kept informed as well as the people who generally go to the meeting -- thanks.

Until further notice, Gas Control has informed me that the Demarc Numbers are not required at this time, as the temperature on the system are warming up. But be prepared when the temperature go back down, we will be required to start re-supplying the numbers back to Gas Control to report on. Thank you.

Team,

This is the latest info that I know about MOPS.

There is a leak in the 24inch line. The entire system had to be shut down so that the divers would have safe working conditions.

There are currently divers on the sight.  Over the weekend they were not able to make repairs due to the inclement weather.  The EARLIEST the MOPS system can be expected to be up and running is late Wednesday night. 

If customers inquire please direct them to the bulletin board. Please do not disclose volumes or answer probing questions.  (Telling them that we think that MOPS might be back late Wed. night is ok.)  If you are in doubt you can refer any questions to me (I will probably ask Sherry or Chris:) I will be out on comp days Thurs and Friday in my absence please contact Chris Greaney at extension 3-4826.

It is also very important that we continue to allocate the 6 MOPS delivery points with the force majeure code. All customer who request critical day notices receive notices when that code is either 1) set on the timely and 2) removed on any cycle once set on the timely.  If you are in doubt please ask. 

Cara

Tim, I know we have the budget crunch and meetings this week, but when you get time per our conversation yesterday, please provide the Project Tracking Number for the Citizens Griffith RTU modifications to the folks listed above.  As long as we have this number available before timesheets are due we should be alright.  

All, this number should be used to track all of your labor, traveling expenses and/or any material required for this project.

At this point the modifications continuing forward for a Friday morning installation.  Citizens has been advised of the schedule and Darryl Scoolcraft has been notified.  Scott and Russ, please make sure you contact the gas control desk just prior to implementing the changes so they can be standing by.  Citizens has notified El Paso of the planned changes and timeline so that they are prepared to make up any volumes should a problem occur.  Scott and/or Russ will provide gas control with the register number to access the variable pressure setpoint remotely.  Darryl has requested that we initially set the pressure control at no lower than 680 to 700#'s.     Let me know if anyone has questions.

FYI,

Mike Burnam gave me a call to visit about units 23 & 24. He wanted to make sure we new when lose either of those two units we lose about 5 mmcf of the volume we get from the Haskell Co. side. In the last month or so Oneok has been giving us a little more gas in that area.

 I will be distributing your individual vacation carryover report today.  It should match up with what shows on eHRonline. There are a few that show a negative carryover balance, subtract that from this year's allowed vacation hours. If you have a question give me a call and I will try my best to answer it.  Otherwise I will get an answer for you from Human Resources.

Your vacation carryover to 2002, if you have any, will not be reflected accurately in eHRonline until after January 31.  Next week I will run a 2001 off duty report for each of you so at least you can confirm the total vacation days recorded.

02/01/02 @ 08:35 a single pig was launched from Bloomfield Comp. Sta. @ 1145 psig and 865 mmcf/d rate.
09:43 pig past M.L. valve s108
10:10 Bisti Comp. Sta. taken down.
10:55 pig past Bisti Sta.
11:10 Bisti Comp. back on line.
11:54 pig past M.L. valve s110
13:50 pig received @ Gallup Comp. Sta. by some very competent techs. 752 psig approx. 1/2 gallon of yellow powder accompanied this pig. The suspicious powder was first thought to be an extremely rare strain of deadly yellow anthrax, but after further testing ( They made Wally taste it ), it was decided that it was just regular pipeline crud.

Trailblazer will have an outage starting Tuesday, Feb. 5th. for 4 to 8 days. They are only going to schedule firm on their side during this time which is 522,000 mmbtu/d. This is about 100,000 mmbtu/d less than their capacity.  Also their pressure will be running lower which will be around 625 #  maybe higher.

Ron you are correct.  The permitted horsepower forBloomfield is 5879.  We cant go over this value....without submitting a notification to the State of New Mexico and waiting for their approval....

This shows that with a 350 Hp increase per unit, we would still not exceed operational Hp even in the winter.  We max out about 4500 Hp in the summer on a good day and this winter TW had a one-hour peak of 5500 Hp.  Adding 5500 + 350 Hp still is below the 5879 Hp rating for emissions.  I'm copying Larry to be sure that the assumption the air permit was issued for 5879 Hp is true.  I'll verify with Larry ASAP.

guys, the turbines at Bloomfield are site rated at 5879 HP.  Solar rates the three units at sea level for around 7000, but due to the elevation impacts on the units they are derated to the 5879 number.

I received a call from Cornbelt Electric saying that on January 28, they want to limit the H. P. at Hubbard to 6000 from 0900 to 1600 for alliant to do line maintenance.  I have passed this information on to Pat and Pierre and Pierre said he will take care of it for us.

Greetings "Cruise Group,"

Below is the information from the travel agent concerning our June
cruise.  The agent's names is Virginia Book (281-293-3666).  She is
copied on this email if you need to email her as well.

It looks like, depending on what room you wanted, the price is $50 -
200/person more than what Robyn originally told you.  Robyn feels bad,
but I told her that's "chump change" to all you Rockefellers.  However,
if you want to downgrade your room (to "peasant" class with all the
Browns) to compensate for that increase, please contact Virginia
directly.

You need to contact Virginia concerning your deposit and specific
identification name by Sunday, Feb 10 which really means Friday, Feb. 8.
Don't forget or delay.  We'd hate to lose some of you.  We've got a good
group together.  Because of our group size, we're going to get some
discounts (See below).  Anything we get as a lump-sum discount, Robyn
and I will ensure it gets spread across the entire group.

Scooter/Kenny - Please provide this information to the friends you've
invited.  Also, I'm not sure my email address for Rusty is good, so make
sure he knows.

Virginia - There is a group of us interested in playing golf at one of
the disports.  Can you find out for me the possibilities of getting
tee-times (3) for about 10 folks to play?  It looks like the most likely
spots are Grand Cayman or Mexico.  Obviously, I don't have a feel for
course availability or timing requirements.  I would look to you to tell
me where my best spot is to get off the boat, play a round of golf on an
adequate course, and get back on the boat before I get left.  Please let
me know what my golfing options are.  Thanks.
************************************************************************
********************
I REALLY APPRECIATE TAKING CARE OF YOUR GROUP FOR THE GALVESTON SAILING
OF THE "RHAPSODY OF THE SEAS" June 9-16,2002.

The rates are as follows:

Category K (J not available)- 900 plus 139.00 and 21.55 taxes and fees
total 1060.55 each and 2121.10 per cabin

Category I- 1060 plus 139.00 and 21.55 taxes and fee total 1220.55 each
and 2441.10 per cabin

Category F- 1160 plus 139.00 and 21.55 taxes and fees total 1320.55 each
and 2641.10 per cabin

Category D- 1510 plus 139.00 and 21.55 taxes and fees total 1670.55 each
and 3341.10 per cabin

Deposit of 500.00 per cabin and exact passport or birth certificate
names are due on February 10.  Final payment is due by April 5. I will
need credit card(preferred) for payment or if paying by check need to
have checks here at least 7 days prior to payment dates.  There will be
a 50.00 per cabin discount at final payment.  Also, if all cabins booked
sail, there will be a tour conductor deduction of 1060.00 be divided
among all ten (cabins) of you at final payments.

Royal Caribbean does not sell cancellation insurance for groups, but it
is recommended at 99.00 each.  I will call Berkley Care, the company
that does their insurance, for you after deposit and names are
confirmed.  Berkley Care only takes checks.

You all will need a valid passport or Certified or original birth
certificate with raised seal and government I.D. ( like driver's
license).  Sometimes the ladies need their marriage certificate to show
the maiden name matching on birth certificate.  I will check on that for
you all.

He cancellation penalties are as follows:

>From 59-30 days 250.00 per person
>From 29-8 days 50 percent of total price
7 days or less - no refund.

This is so exciting and you all have a fine ship for your sailing
experience.
You are confirmed for second seating for meals but that can be changed
if you like.

Many thanks, Virginia

Here are two other points to update. Darrell told me that the BRI Jackrabbit poi # 500620 is active on TW, but not on Burlington's side. They are not set up to take the gas. It should be made inactive. Also poi 78161 & 500168 are the same point. We sum to poi 500168. So # 78161 should also be made not valid for Transport. 
Thanks Ramona

POI 500631 is an active, valid point in the San Juan Basin.  It has not started flowing as of yet.  It will stay in the groups it has been set up in until we are told otherwise by facility planning.

The Valero-Pecos point is available now but not as a bi-directional point. We can only flow  from Transwestern to Valero at this time, until El Paso decides what they want to do with the other run.

Ben, I understand the team collected pressure data at the mainline valves on the SJ lateral and forwarded to you all Tuesday.  Have you had the opportunity to calculate the current eff. following the dry pig run made last week?

Gallup, please provide digital pictures if possible and of course quantities of liquids and/or solids received.

Ben, I assume you be able to provide the post pigging effeciency on the lateral so we can continue to evaluate the timing of the DRA application?

I received  a high h2s alarm at the Westar Carson point and had Joe Martinez to check it out. The point is not flowing at this time, but he did say that we can ignore this alarm in the future because it is a default reading. He will talk to some people soon and get this removed. My understanding is that it used to be a split signal there that would measure the h2s at the kb and westar. But now it's just one signal monitor there that measures the kb and it's set up on 10 min increments. After it gives you an h2s reading on the kb, it automatically switches to westar and gives you a reading there.

Linda/Darrell:	I just talked to Jerry Ridge from the TW Artesia Team about the 4 Pecos Diamond points.  He has had a recent inquiry to possible re-actiivate these meters at the plant.  I would not remove any of the 4 points, because they might be needed in the near future.  The POI's are 9164, 9166, 9167 and 9168.  

Call with any questions, PT  3-0667.

The TMS testers entered a defect stating POI 9168, TW Yates Atoka Pecos Diamond PL 8 Inch, was inactive.  Please let Karen or myself know whether this point should be inactivated in PLE and as of what date.

Thanks

Jeanne,
In talking with Mark McConnell, Jerry Graves and Darrell Schoolcraft we think that if you can have David Duff pull the following point operational capacity out of TCI we can determine what Mark needs.  Please go back as far as you can in the database.  Some points may not exist because they were not in place back in 93 or 94, but pull as much history as you can. 
	Name			POI           
	SoCal - Topock		0056697
	SoCal - Needles		0010487
	PG&E - Topock		0056698
	S.W. Willow Valley	0013198
	N. Starsteel		0500383
	Mojave - Topock		0056696
	Citizen - Kingman	0056659
	Citizen - 89 North	0500046
	Citizen - Forest Branch	0500619
	Citizens - Flagstaff	0500134


Darrell, Jerry and I would like to validate the information prior to forwarding to Mark, so please send me the file and I will coordinate the review.  It might be helpful to know the field names in TCI if you can't find operational capacity.  We probably called it something different back then.

Thank you for your help.
Donna

Gentlemen,
 I need to schedule 2 hrs. down time ( zero flow ) for sta. 010169-01 TW / TransColorado I/C ( Blanco Hub receipt ). Starting at 09:00 MST on 3-19-02.
We are going change out a 12" turbine meter out, and visually inspect the meter tube. Rick Downey with Kinder Morgan is scheduling this with his people as well. We should be able to make up the noms. pretty easily, as they always have plenty of line pressure and lots of gas.
Thanks,
Blackie

Is this an official request to amend their contract, or will they send that later?

Subject:	Duke k#27579

During the Crawford outage scheduled for 3/5-7, Duke has requested to move its primary receipt point from Crawford to the Duke WT-1 receipt point.  Since there will be no flows from Crawford I think this should work.  The contract # is 27579 with an MDQ of 20,000/d.  Thanks.

Subject:	 MOPS Update



The South Central Team has been fielding several calls from customers regarding the status of MOPS, Cara and Chris were invited to conference with the Tivoli Area and the crew working on the leak.

The latest information as of 11:00 am Wednesday 2/13/02 is as follows:

Operations:
The earliest the MOPS system will be unavailable this Saturday 2/16/02 (  best estimate )

The diving crew has located the exact source of the leak, and they are continuing repairs.  Right now the weather condition's look favorable and the forecast predicts that the good conditions should continue.  The leak is located 160 feet below the surface which presents complications no matter the weather conditions.

At least one member of the South Central Team will listen in on the daily conference call (11:00 am Central Time) and will keep everyone updated; this should help improve the accuracy and timeliness of our information.

Scheduling:

Darrell will set the operational capacity to 0 through the 18th on the delivery locations. If the MOPS system come back on before that time the operational capacities can be brought up. This information is available on the bulletin board.

Remember to post as a FORCE MAJEURE on the allocations. If receipt points (ex:platform 762) update the point and their deliveries will be cut.  

Some customers have been calling and inquiring if they should nom. gas in the MOPS system. Noming gas is at the shippers discretion, as long as the system is down we will continue to confirm their gas to 0 and allocated the delivery points.   Please direct them to the bulletin board.  It is ok to let them know of our timeline, please stress that this is an estimate.  If you are not comfortable answering any question, please direct them to myself (5-2871), Chris (3-4826) Sherry (3-3063), or Bob Burleson (713-287-1049)

We will keep up updated as the MOPS situation continues. Cara will be on comp days Thurs and Friday-- Chris and Sherry will cover my desk and MOPS in my absence. 

Thanks,
Cara and Chris

FYI,
The Oasis point has been corrected to match what the imbalance should be.  Contract numbers were switched around and should be fixed for tomorrows morning meeting.  The cumulative imbalance for Valero Sprayberry is right around -620,000 dths. The other points on the sheet have also been updated with the correct contract numbers.
Thanks,
Scott

Subject:	Morning Meetings

Terry stopped by to ask that all of us look at the Gas Plan -- the portion listing our points, the monthly imbalance and the cumulative imbalance.  

Probably this is Scott mostly -- Scott has the Oasis, EPNG, Lone Star group & Valero interconnects, Cara has PEPL, Robert has KN Pony Express, and Chris has Halley.  In any event, please take a look at this summary page of the Gas Plan.  We need to be aware DAILY if these numbers that are coming across are fairly correct -- are we in the ballpark, etc.  

The example we can look at is Oasis -- we don't see how we could be short 620,000 cumulative at Oasis yet that's the number that is being reflected.  Scott is already tackling this one.  Terry said we need to get in touch with Dale Ratliff to get the numbers corrected.  And, we need to do this today.  This is a high profile item that Dynegy will be looking at.

Terry has asked that we make sure Gary is always kept informed as well as the people who generally go to the meeting -- thanks.

POI 78161 is not valid in both production and model office PLE and has been since 8/1/2001.  I'm not sure where you are seeing it valid but it is definitely not valid in PLE.

Linda,
Here are two other points to update. Darrell told me that the BRI Jackrabbit poi # 500620 is active on TW, but not on Burlington's side. They are not set up to take the gas. It should be made inactive. Also poi 78161 & 500168 are the same point. We sum to poi 500168. So # 78161 should also be made not valid for Transport. 
Thanks Ramona

POI 500631 is an active, valid point in the San Juan Basin.  It has not started flowing as of yet.  It will stay in the groups it has been set up in until we are told otherwise by facility planning.

   I received  a call from Randy Lebeau about hearing that Hemp. 3 volumes were going away Feb. 1st. I have since found out that it is true from Jerry knight with Oneok. They are diverting this gas over to one of their own gathering systems the 1st. of Feb. If marketing or the field has heard of any other gas being diverted off Northern please give me a call.

Thanks
Gary

All,

Attached below is the updated list of displacement points and Bidirectioanl points. I have made the changes for the Displacement SP group and the Displacement IT Groups. The points to be added to the Displacement SP group are valid as receipt points only and not as delivery points on  Supply pools.

Linda,
Can you let me know when these updates are made to PLE model office & Production?
I have also saved this file to the P drive under CMS projects.

Thanks Ramona

Gary Spraggins and Kay Threet have agreed to an OBA Payback of 5,000 dth at POI 158 - Tex Harvey (Delivery to them) and 
POI 152 - Reeves (Receipt back to NNG).  This is creates a "zero" net effect on the pipe.

The Payback at Reeves will increase from 5,000 to 10,000 dth with this payback.  The first 5,000 dth reflects a similiar payback agreement where the payback is at POI 1709 - Duke - Linam Ranch (Delivery to Duke).

This will have OneOk Westex's OBA's near zero by the end of the month.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Randy Janzen

The fuel valve replacement is scheduled for April 2nd, in order to accommodate everyone's schedule, contractors, Solar representatives, regional field engineers, etc..  This will coincide with our annual turnaround, which is scheduled for April 2nd through the 5th.  Unit A-102 is currently running in the normal solonox mode to prevent any compliance issues, but is being operated at a reduced RPM.  Hopefully this will satisfy all interests until repairs can be made.  If you have any questions, please call us @ (970) 259-8238.

I don't have an outage for fuel valve replacement yet. Would that need to be done during the scheduled turn around?

Has there been an outage scheduled to replace the fuel valve on unit 2 at La Plata?

Todd, where do we stand with the station control modifications?

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

POI 78161 is not valid in both production and model office PLE and has been since 8/1/2001.  I'm not sure where you are seeing it valid but it is definitely not valid in PLE.

Linda,
Here are two other points to update. Darrell told me that the BRI Jackrabbit poi # 500620 is active on TW, but not on Burlington's side. They are not set up to take the gas. It should be made inactive. Also poi 78161 & 500168 are the same point. We sum to poi 500168. So # 78161 should also be made not valid for Transport. 
Thanks Ramona

POI 500631 is an active, valid point in the San Juan Basin.  It has not started flowing as of yet.  It will stay in the groups it has been set up in until we are told otherwise by facility planning.

Your vacation carryover to 2002, if you have any, will not be reflected accurately in eHRonline until after January 31.  Next week I will run a 2001 off duty report for each of you so at least you can confirm the total vacation days recorded.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 2
>From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16
>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the "other" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says "empty deleted items folder upon exit".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call us at:

Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)

Corporate IT will be performing maintenance this weekend which may interrupt our connection to the R: drive which houses the INTERNAL ETS TMS  from the INTERNAL desktops ONLY.   If the maintenance does cause a problem with the R: script, weekend reps. will have to access TMS via the HotTap web (www.hottap.enron.com).    Please have weekend reps. call the HotTap Help Desk to ensure they know their ID and passwords to access HotTap via the web.

Thanks,
HotTap Help Desk
Kim Perez

P.S.   This should not affect HotTap RAS access which is different from HotTap.

We are ordering hard copies of the regs as you requested, but in the mean time, you can read the official text at the following web site:

		http://ops.dot.gov/cfr2000/part192.htm

For gas, OQ is addressed near the end of the file at 49CFR 192.801, Subpart N.



		http://ops.dot.gov/cfr2000/part195.htm

For oil, look for the OQ Rule at 49CFR 195.501, Subpart G - also near the end of the document.......

 -----Original Task-----
Subject:	Bloomfield Issues
Due date:	Fri 2/22/2002

Status:	Not Started
Attendees:	Licciardo, Jeanne; Betancourt, Ramona ; Trevino, Linda; Kedwaii, Hasan; Frazier, Perry; Feng, Wayne; Draemer, Mary ; Hermanek, Patty; Kuehl, Toby; Schoolcraft, Darrell; Resendez, Benito



Following decisions were reached in the meeting today:

1) CMS will continue with it's implementation of Bloomfield Compressor point and points behind it in Division and associated points pattern.
2) CMS will continue to assign volume to each point behind the compressor as well as the compressor itself.
3) CMS will pass to TMS the Bloomfield Compressor point as well as the points behind it along with their assigned volumes.
4) CMS will pass to CAS information regarding the Bloomfield Compressor point only.  This fits the current business pattern (Dennis Lee and Perry Frazier will validated this in model office).
5) Since there is no change to mechanism that will feed information to CAS, Information Posting for TW capacities (Unsubscribed and Operationally available) should not be impacted.  Toby Kuehl will validate this in model office.
6) Since there is no change to mechanism that will feed information to CAS, EDI for TW capacities should not be impacted.  Mary Draemer, working with Steve Plant, will validate this in model office.
7) TMS will fix the view that displays capacities at points to make it like current production. (Wayne)
8) Ramona will start testing the TMS allocation process
9) Jose will assess the impact on any TMS reports
10) David Duff will review the TW Batch reports for any impact

FYI,

John Sturn ran some numbers to see if we could put units 1&2 on for a test run. Here are the details. I told Kim at Tescott, to work with the Controllers to get the go ahead.

Subject:	Re: Test run Units #1 & #2

The configuration below should be fairly workable.  If tomorrow's demands come out about like they are looking, it could be done then.



Bushton bypass D-E to D-E and compresses about 200 MM/D of recompress to the D-E.  Tescott runs 1 and 2 with a common D-E suction to an E discharge and cracks to the D discharge.  This setup pretty well isolates all the changes to Tescott.  It does not involve a lot compression changes at other stations or moving pack around.  So it ought to be relatively easy to set up and take apart when the test is done.

Questions or comments, let me know.

Subject:	Test run Units #1 & #2

We would like to test units #1 and #2 to complete the Station debugging for these units.  We would like to do this, this week  or next week if possible as we are approaching warmer weather. To do this we would like to run the units for a several hours when the higher flows are needed then if we need to we can slip unit 5 on for unattended operations or take unit 5 down early and run unit #1 & #2 until not needed.  Please let us know what the outlook is so we can plan for this.

If you have any questions feel free to call 785-283-4225

San Juan/La Plata,  do you folks already have your required downtime (outage info) for 2002 turned in?  I know the date may well change since the Outage meeting with the customers up there will not occur until March 7th, in Houston but, your estimated required downtime per unit should be available.  Please provide the amount of downtime you need at each facility to myself, Jerry and Darryl asap..  Let me know if I can help or if you need claification.  Thanks

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

I'll be out of the office the rest of the week. We are doing some enhancements to the Interim Offsite at the Hangar today. The Hangar Offsite will
remain configured and available for use. I will be in Midland Thursday and Friday. I will be checking my phone mail and email. Don't hesitate to contact me via pager or cell if I'm needed.

Due to the President's Day Holiday on next Monday, February 18, Steve will hold his staff meeting on Tuesday, February 19, same time, same location.

As a courtesy to all attendees, Steve is asking, once again, that all participants arrive by 2:30 pm allowing for a prompt start time and for discussions to flow in an effective manner.    Your contributions to the discussions are crucial and deserve to be heard by all concerned.  Achieving this objective is why we ask your cooperation.

Because our attendee list has grown significantly in the past few months, arrangements have been made with facilities to have a standing order of chairs available for your convenience.

Please call if you have any concerns or questions.

The South Central Team has been fielding several calls from customers regarding the status of MOPS, Cara and Chris were invited to conference with the Tivoli Area and the crew working on the leak.

The latest information as of 11:00 am Wednesday 2/13/02 is as follows:

Operations:
The earliest the MOPS system will be unavailable this Saturday 2/16/02 (  best estimate )

The diving crew has located the exact source of the leak, and they are continuing repairs.  Right now the weather condition's look favorable and the forecast predicts that the good conditions should continue.  The leak is located 160 feet below the surface which presents complications no matter the weather conditions.

At least one member of the South Central Team will listen in on the daily conference call (11:00 am Central Time) and will keep everyone updated; this should help improve the accuracy and timeliness of our information.

Scheduling:

Darrell will set the operational capacity to 0 through the 18th on the delivery locations. If the MOPS system come back on before that time the operational capacities can be brought up. This information is available on the bulletin board.

Remember to post as a FORCE MAJEURE on the allocations. If receipt points (ex:platform 762) update the point and their deliveries will be cut.  

Some customers have been calling and inquiring if they should nom. gas in the MOPS system. Noming gas is at the shippers discretion, as long as the system is down we will continue to confirm their gas to 0 and allocated the delivery points.   Please direct them to the bulletin board.  It is ok to let them know of our timeline, please stress that this is an estimate.  If you are not comfortable answering any question, please direct them to myself (5-2871), Chris (3-4826) Sherry (3-3063), or Bob Burleson (713-287-1049)

We will keep up updated as the MOPS situation continues. Cara will be on comp days Thurs and Friday-- Chris and Sherry will cover my desk and MOPS in my absence. 

Thanks,
Cara and Chris

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

One more thing, if you are uncertain as to what allocation code to put on the point or group being allocated or the information was not relayed to you from one shift to another. Please ask or call one of the Gas Control Team Advisors or Scheduling Team Advisors prior to allocating. This will assure that all individuals are using the same code for all cycles. If you have questions, please ask. Thank you.

For the remainder of the Mops outage or until Gary or Darrell tell you otherwise, make sure that you select "FMJ" for every "CYCLE", while we are allocating. As this can and will cause confusion to the shippers and operators when they look at the posting on the EBB. As, we don't want the posting to be "Critical" one time and the next time "NOT Critical" the next. If you have questions, please ask. Thank you.

Amelia,
These are the dates we have blocked off for Dan's monthly Director meetings.
Can you reserve and block these dates for us?  Whichever conference room?  I would imagine a large conference room would work.  (15 - 20 capacity).  Is there anything like this on 45th or 46th floor in the Enron building?

This is Dan's all day staff meetings for the year 2002.  (7:00AM - 5:30PM)

All requested changes to points in the production PLE system must be sent to the PLE group by a TW business user (Facility Planning/Gas Control for physical points, Marketing for non-physical) via email in order for us to make the changes.  We cannot make changes to points based on testing defects.

Thanks

In visiting with the Canadian Team, they have informed me that we still have not ran a pig on the TW 24" Panhandle Lateral. It has been years since this pig has been run and we are sitting with a lot of high PH liquid in the line that is acidic. The last time a pig was run from Canadian River STation into P-3, they received approxamitly 1200 bbls and the station was flooded.

Due to the increase in pipeline safety and awareness, it is imperative that we set something up to run a pig on this line. We should run a pig quarterly or at least twice a year to maintain our pipeline integrity. Please let me know what you can get done on setting this up.

Thanks, 
Mickey

FYI,

They need to take a look at unit 103 & 102. Unit 103 is now for no demand so they are going to work on it first. When the get the bugs out of it, they will take 102 down. Which will probably be tomorrow or the next day.

Mary,

A list of OBA concerns for possible tariff revisions are as follows:

	1.  A mechanism to assure Operators remain within an acceptable tolerance (5%) on a daily basis, or receive a penalty.

	2.  A mechanism to require specific reconciliation periods ( Quarterly).

	3.  A mechanism to require specific periods to allow a final contract disposition to a "0"  balance, upon reconciliation.

The above suggestions would reduce the misuse of the OBA contacts.

Thanks


Robert

Due to Ramona being out Friday, I would like to keep this CAS overview scheduled for today, Thursday afternoon, from 1:30 to 3pm.  Ramona will be available for only a short time today.  Perry, if you don't mind, for today, could you show Jerry Skertich and I a CAS overview from your viewpoint.  Darrell, perhaps Jerry and I can get with you either tomorrow or sometime next week to get your viewpoint.  

Please let me know if everyone is okay with meeting today for about an hour.  I will see if I can get room 3907 for this afternoon.  Thx, Jim

It is imperative that the evening person make sure that Gary Spraggins receives a copy of the Demarc numbers that are generated during the allocation process of the evening cycle.
 If Shirley is on duty, she either needs to call and leave Gary a phone mail message with the Demarc numbers or Shirley should faxe a copy of the Demarc screen to the person in the office so they can leave it in Gary's chair. 


Thanks: John Buchanan

While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.
If you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned, or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies, please
call me 713 328-5139, or email lhinson@allianceworldwide.com

Here's what I noticed in researching the points listed below:

Point #	Point Name				Template 				Comment	

6828	NGPL Gray County 			Panhandle Receipts Delivery 		Already exists under PHDEL template
8143	TW/Seven M Gas Sherman CO. I/C	Panhandle ReceiptsDelivery		Already exists under PHDEL template
9028	Delhi Cheyenne				Panhandle Receipts			Point has term date of 11/18/98
9278	TW/NNG Hutchinson Cactus Lateral	Panhandle Receipts/Delivery		Already exists under PHDEL and PHREC template (as bi-directional pt)
12354	Dominion Gas/Tule Lake I/C		CE9Receipts				Already exists under CE9REC template
13855	Getty Fed "24" #1			West Texas Receipts			Point has term date of 11/18/98
15409	Jones Trust #44-565 CMP		Panhandle Receipts			Point has term date of 11/18/98
56943	Valero Ward				West Texas ReceiptsDelivery		Already exists under WTDEL template
57096	Northwest Bloomfield			San Juan Receipts			Is this point valid any longer?
58710	PNM Thompson				CE9ReceiptsDelivery			Already exists under CE9DEL template
500517	Delhi Ward I/C				West Texas ReceiptsDelivery		Already exists under WTDEL template
500540	El Paso Blanco I/C			San Juan 2 ReceiptsDelivery		Should not be added to a template since they were set up 
												as alt pt on each contract (until we move to new system)

3531	TW/NNG Beaver				Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template
500176	Dale Ferguson Tap			Panhandle Deliveries			Needs to be added to PHDEL template
500203	Continental Follette			Panhandle Deliveries			Needs to be added to PHDEL template
500390	Sum WTG Delivery Pt 			Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template

Lindy - Could you verify if POI #57096 is still valid for any reason?

Ramona - It appears that some of these points are available for displacement.  In the new system, Linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid.  I will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template (ie, if a delivery point allows displacement, then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template.  Nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles.).


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	TW Contract Template Clean-up

In cleaning up some template information, the following points were found to be on no templates. 

	1. Do they belong on a template?
	2. Is the template listed the correct one?

Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.

Rob called this afternoon and this procedure may actually take place this evening.  Rob will be e-mailing w/attachment to the reps on call so want to make sure everyone is on board with this.  The attachment should detail what the nom is -- PLEASE make sure you check for this first thing so this will schedule correctly for the final process.

I will be in town after all this weekend, so please call if any questions -- 281-376-2336.  Thanks!

Subject:	FW: USGT  after hours gas flow
Importance:	High


If the following occurs, USGT will put in a "Final" nom after confirming with all gas controls that we can physically make this happen.  Oasis and/or Transok will confirm prior to the confirmation online deadline for the final.  USGT will also fax the info to NNG's Gas Control and to the South Central team.

It is most likely that this nomination have the notation of  "invalid transaction" so we need to make sure with whoever is running the final they are aware of what's going on -- like the North team advises us of Minnegasco's changes when they occur.

Now that I've probably confused everyone, I am going home.  Let me know Thursday if anyone has any questions -- thanks.

Subject:	USGT  after hours gas flow



Since NNG is allocating storage you may get a call from USGT wanting to bring gas into NNG from Transok or Oasis going to TW. If they do they will  get all  parties on the phone and make sure everyone agrees to start flow real time at receipt and delivery point. Also USGT would need to fax a nomination into gas control the following morning so that it is accounted for. (Like we do with Minnigasco) Be sure and log this and let your relief know so that we don't miss it the next morning.

Jerry,
Attached is a revision to push the outage back one week.  In fact it would fit my schedule better this way.

Thanks

Randy, the time table you have for this outage  is 02/26 to 02/28 to replace a section of the exhaust header. If we have cold temps the first part of the week, can this outage be pushed back a few days? 

Jerry

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Gene Laurenson from Beatrice is scheduling Wednesday February the 6th to do measurement testing at the NGPL Trailblazer interconnect. They are bringing Don Mowrer (NNG specialist) and a specialist in from NGPL to perform the tests. They would like to see the flows stay about were they are at. (425 +) Also, he said it would be a bonus if some of the gas was being compressed up the C-line. (Currently compressing up the C & D and cracking into the B)

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

As of Sunday, January 20, 2002 
Griffith Power plant located off of TW's mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market.

Gas Control Issues:
Nominations:
Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements
between Duke and PPL.
You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics 
Team.

Flows:
We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations.  We will watch the noms this week to get a feel
of where and how much they may vary.  
As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella, We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your
going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order.(If this looks like it is going to be
small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers.)  
Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 (TW primary)  
When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 (El Paso primary), and flow the gas until accumed
and switch back to 1 (TW primary). 
If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it.  Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the
Site from Gas Control.
The only time we should get the Citizens people involved with the I/C is if we have a problem with Primary switches or pressure
problems.  Please refer to the call out sheet on the Console for Citizens.

Please don't hesitate to call if you need help.

Thanks DS

We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

Stan

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Feb 27
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will block all ICMP messages from all Internet routers.  These changes will be made on the Houston, Ardmore EIN, and Omaha Internet routers.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 27
>From 9:00 - 10:00 p.m., the Messaging team will upgrade Nahou-MSBES01P, Nahou-MSBES02P and Nahou-MSBES03P to SP2 and apply a hotfix.  This change will result in a five minute delay sending and receiving Blackberry messages.

Feb 28
>From 7:00 p.m. through 3/1 at 1:00 a.m., the Unix team will upgrade the ftp.enron.com server from existing Ultar2 to E450 as well as upgrade ftp to Proftp ver. 1.2. This maintenance will result in a total outage of the ftp.enron.com site.  The old sites moby.enron.com and sparky.enron.com will no longer exist after this change.  Support staff should ensure jobs going to the enron ftp server use ftp.enron.com.  Any questions about this maintenance, contact me at 713-853-3381 or 713-859-6676.

Mar. 6
At 12:00 p.m., the Gas Measurement team will decommission the MIPS server (IP address 192.168.175.62).  All users and processing should be pointing to PGAS as the MIPS system is not longer being updated. The MIPS server will be powered off at this time but the equipment will not be moved until later.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Cliff gave many years of dedicated service to the company and his spirit and wit will be remembered.  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Cliff's wife, Carol, and his two children, J.C and Lauren.

We know many of you will want to do something for Cliff's family.  We will notify you as soon as possible about the Baxter's wishes.

Hey guys here is some more information for you to digest. If everyone would like to stay at the same hotel we can get a block of rooms for a cheaper rate (about $150), I just need the names of those people, or you can make you own plans. Hotels further away from the downtown area are a little cheaper, but it might be worth the price not to fight the traffic on Thursday morning. All three of these hotels are within walking distance to the office. (One to two blocks)

Downtown Hotels
Hyatt  713-654-1234
Rate - $220 per night
Doubletree  713 -759-0202
Rate - $245

Jerry, regarding the station #8 outage request #37 on outage report dated 01-17-2002.  We requested an outage to block in the mainline at  station 8 to replace a leaking scrubber valve.  After further research we found that we can change this valve without blocking in the main line.  Therefore that outage request may be eliminated.
Thanks
Mick  Becker
Station#8

The Operator Qualification (OQ) Rule, 49 CFR 192.801 requires that all pipelines develop a qualification program to evaluate individual's ability to perform covered tasks.  Each gas controller must complete the qualification program no later than June 1, 2002.  Each task must be completed in the presence of a trained Verifier in order to be qualified for that covered task.  The successful completion of a task must be documented and sent to the Training Group.  An individual may ask to be verified on a task as many times as necessary to successfully complete the task and receive a "Qualified" status.

At the November gas control staff meeting each gas controller was given a copy of the Skills Qualification Manual (SQM) and the Training and Verification Guide (TV Guide) to review.  I will be receiving the official personalized SQM this week and verification can begin at any time after that.  Steve January will assign you to one of the verifiers listed below:

Jerry Graves
Dale Ratliff
Darrell Schoolcraft
Gary Spraggins 

Verification and qualification will take place on days and at the control board.  Your team members will be responsible for operating your position and answering the phone during this process.  It is very important to keep interruptions at minimum.  You can verify on all or any part of the SQM when you feel you are ready. 

We are required by law to document that you can perform the task in the SQM. Remember this is your job, you do this everyday, and you do it very well.  If you have any questions call me at 713-853-1534

During the Crawford outage scheduled for 3/5-7, Duke has requested to move its primary receipt point from Crawford to the Duke WT-1 receipt point.  Since there will be no flows from Crawford I think this should work.  The contract # is 27579 with an MDQ of 20,000/d.  Thanks.

Earl, we noted in a weekly report that this IC was approved for construction with a May 1st startup date.  We gave a heads up to Jerry and Darryl that a potential interruption to flow could occur in the near future as a result of tie-ins for this IC.  Jerry and Darryl then requested that the tie-ins be made during our LaPlata outage which is a three day outage during April 2nd, 3rd, & 4th.  I asked that Jerry and Darryl discuss the time frame of tie-ins for Questar with you, as I could not say one way or the other if you could mobilize by then. 

Jerry/Darryl, I did however, discuss with the Team to determine if the tie-ins occured during the same time frame as the La Plata outage, what would be the impact to manpower and scheduling of tasks at La Plata.  The Team committed to the tie-ins during the same time frame but will be asking for 4 days of down time at La Plata now versus the 3 days origianlly requested.  They will look at options such as contract labor, support team, etc... to see if they can squeeze this back to three days, but it will be a few weeks before that information is communicated.  

Chris Gaston will be the team point of contact for the Questar tie-ins...  Blackie Foutz will be the Team point person for measurment related issues related to design/installation.

Earl, can you provide the team with the work order number so that payroll can be charged as they become involved?   Also, can you provide the tentative date of commissioning the interconnect so that we can insure George Kniesley is available to participate along with the team.  
 
Team, charge time to the work order only as support is requested from E&C and/or is necessary as part of start up and commissioning.  

If I can do anything to help, please give me a call...

Subject:	Questar IC

Jack Ohearn with Questar and Roswell E&C will meet at the Bloomfield station on 2-20-02 @ 8:00 am to determine where the interconnect will be located, TW or Questar right of way. All of the details of the IC are being worked out and TW is to own and operate at this time. Locations, design, who is to construct and equipment are issues being resolved at this time. 
If you have any questions, please let me know next week. 
I'm not sure of who the team contact will be on this project, but if the team or contact has other commitments, this meeting is to resolve the location and the team's impute is welcome. 

Thanks

Darrell - has Burlington disconnected from TW?  If not could gas flow at any time at this point?

Linda,
Here are two other points to update. Darrell told me that the BRI Jackrabbit poi # 500620 is active on TW, but not on Burlington's side. They are not set up to take the gas. It should be made inactive. Also poi 78161 & 500168 are the same point. We sum to poi 500168. So # 78161 should also be made not valid for Transport. 
Thanks Ramona

POI 500631 is an active, valid point in the San Juan Basin.  It has not started flowing as of yet.  It will stay in the groups it has been set up in until we are told otherwise by facility planning.

Are you OK on the other changes Maggie noted or do we need to get with you?

Karen - do you have anything on POI 500168?  It is set up as a delivery only in PLE.

500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  Karen was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active
       status.
If any other questions please call

DS

POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The following points need updating in PLE

1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas
500168 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE as such to be picked up in TMS

This shows that with a 350 Hp increase per unit, we would still not exceed operational Hp even in the winter.  We max out about 4500 Hp in the summer on a good day and this winter TW had a one-hour peak of 5500 Hp.  Adding 5500 + 350 Hp still is below the 5879 Hp rating for emissions.  I'm copying Larry to be sure that the assumption the air permit was issued for 5879 Hp is true.  I'll verify with Larry ASAP.

guys, the turbines at Bloomfield are site rated at 5879 HP.  Solar rates the three units at sea level for around 7000, but due to the elevation impacts on the units they are derated to the 5879 number.

I had sent you an email in regards to pigging on the TW 24" Panhandle Lateral and the TW 12" Leedey Lateral. I haven't heard anything and wanted to make sure you are still the person that we need to visit with on getting these task resolved. If not, please let me know who we need to talk to.

The problem is we haven't ran a pig on these lines in years. In order to insure our pipeline integrity, we need to work through these obstacles and get something resolved. We know we have lots of liquid in these lines and need to proceed with pigging.

Please let me know what we need to do to get this accomplished.

Thanks,
Mickey

Problems in accessing mailman.enron.com does not mean external mail is not working.  We are sending notices currently.   Maybe we should sent an external email to test this portion vs. accessing the admin application for external ID's.  I believe sending an email to our skytel (Blackberrys) accounts would work for the test.  

 If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks.  Jean

Your vacation carryover to 2002, if you have any, will not be reflected accurately in eHRonline until after January 31.  Next week I will run a 2001 off duty report for each of you so at least you can confirm the total vacation days recorded.

	Just talked with Mark McConnell and Lonestar rejected (AGAIN) our lastest proposal
	on the new OBA language.  We are starting to get to a point where
	our customers are being impacted by imbalance issues.  Therefore we
	need to put closure to this issue.

	Mark and Bill Rapp are working on the Volumetric OBA and will try to
	turn this around as quickly as possible.  Mark and I agreed we would continue
	monitoring this point on a daily basis as we have done in the past.
	
	I appreciate everyone's help in trying to resolve this issue.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Problems in accessing mailman.enron.com does not mean external mail is not working.  We are sending notices currently.   Maybe we should sent an external email to test this portion vs. accessing the admin application for external ID's.  I believe sending an email to our skytel (Blackberrys) accounts would work for the test.  

 If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks.  Jean

All testing was completed, but we encountered problems with accessing mailman.enron.com.  We opened a problem ticket with the Resolution Center, and they are looking into it.  They will update us as they have more information.   We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 11	
>From 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m., the Envision team will perform hardware maintenance on the Envision system.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16

>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

Tiny, you are correct. At this time I have nothing in the outage report for this. Ben, if something comes up, please let me know, so we can make plans for it.

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

                                           Brian with the Bloomfield Team called to let us know that when the flow gets to fluctuating up and down we are starting to fight for the gas against TransColorado,and El Paso.   (El Paso usually has the lowest pressure )   whoever has the lowest pressure at the time gets the gas. Then the control valve starts to fluctuate up and down trying to control.  Usually it will settle out if you lower the setpt. 2-3 mil.  IF you have any  QUESTIONS talk to BLACKIE FOUTZ w/ Bloomfield Team.

Hi Shelley,

Through these stressful times of people moving around and the company restructuring and splitting out the pipelines, I strongly recommend that Darrell Schoolcraft remain with the TW pipeline group as manager/director of this pipeline group. He is very knowledgeable and very professional  in his duties as a coordinator and certainly would make an excellent  manager/director under any new restructuring plan. He's also been very helpful to me and others in maintaining a solid pipeline as well as keeping the lines of communication open between ourselves and our customers. Shelley, for whatever this is worth, he comes strongly recommended for this positon under any type of restructuring plan. Thanks.

All testing was completed, but we encountered problems during the Flow Gas testing.  The Business Objects on-call was notified, and they are looking into the problem.  They will update us as they have more information.   We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.

I've arranged for Debbie Midgley from VeriForce to provide the training on January 31 from 8AM until 5PM.  This class is for the personnel who will evaluate the skills of other personnel.  Maximum class size is 10.  Please let me know if I've missed Houston or Midland based personnel in the distribution list.




Dale,
Can you reserve a conference room on your floor for the day?  We've called 3 people and can't seem to connect with the person in charge!
Thanks

David, 
Here is our efficiency analysis from the online model.  This is just for the Bisti to Gallup section. The other sections have comparable results.
You can see that before the pigging the average efficiency were at 1.005 and after the pigging it rose to 1.04. Thus, a 4% increase in efficiency. However I see a gradual decreasing trend towards 1.035 just less than a week after the pigging.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ben, I understand the team collected pressure data at the mainline valves on the SJ lateral and forwarded to you all Tuesday.  Have you had the opportunity to calculate the current eff. following the dry pig run made last week?

Gallup, please provide digital pictures if possible and of course quantities of liquids and/or solids received.

Ben, I assume you be able to provide the post pigging effeciency on the lateral so we can continue to evaluate the timing of the DRA application?

I think I have finally decided what to do with these...

Let's keep all of these reports in a separate pile from the Blanco reports as long as there is no other downstream gas being scheduled (ie @ Blanco or Window Rock)  In that case we will have to break the reports down by Point Number, ie, Griffith is 288615 on El Paso.

At the end of the gas day, whe filing away reports, please leave the Griffith reports on my desk, I will file them away myself.

I wasn't quite sure how to deal with these, but I have concluded that as EAMR, agent for Citizens, we should be keeping a separate file as this function.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Thanks!
Amy

Darrell,

POI 56943 has never been bi-directional in the system?  It has always been an out.  Is there another point number that was used as the receipt?
As far as Jackrabbit the field needs to call in that the point is inactive and should be abandoned.  We can inactivate the point to keep people from noming if you want to do that.

56943 TW-NNG Ward-- We need to leave as Bi-directional.  Will Fernandes called back and said they were mistaken and there
                                   are still one 8" orfice run dedicated to flow gas back to TW.  They apologize for the confussion.
Burlington Jackrabbit-- Olivia with Burlington called and the point does no longer exist on their side and will not ever be using it.
                                  Does this mean we can inactivate it on TW?

500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  Karen was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active
       status.
If any other questions please call

POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The following points need updating in PLE

1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas

FYI,

Mike Burnam gave me a call to visit about units 23 & 24. He wanted to make sure we new when lose either of those two units we lose about 5 mmcf of the volume we get from the Haskell Co. side. In the last month or so Oneok has been giving us a little more gas in that area.

Currently the Northend temperatures show to drop from mid 30's Saturday to 19 degrees Sunday and 10 degrees for system weighted temperature for Monday and start back up into the high 20's and low 30's by Friday of next week. With these kind of temperatures and Redfield withdrawals falling off it is going to starting requiring more flow coming up from the south.I would recommend that we hold off and see what the end of next week looks like.

Randy, the time table you have for this outage  is 02/26 to 02/28 to replace a section of the exhaust header. If we have cold temps the first part of the week, can this outage be pushed back a few days?

It was reported in the morning meeting today that NGPL Trailblazer will be having an outage April 9,10&11, at which time there will be no gas available to flow at the  trailblazer interconnect. Jerry would you check with Beatrice and see if there is anything we need to plan on our side at this time.

Thanks 
Gary

Darrell,

Who are we physically receiving gas from at POI 59927, the GPM Zia Plant.  Is it GPM or Conoco?   I found a letter from GPM requesting Conoco to be their agent at this point so I need to know if this is GPM's point and Conoco is only the agent or is Conoco actually the physical operator.  Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks

Linda

    Thursday, February 7, 2002 Issue 46   EDITORIAL  The hottest topic in t=
he energy industry this week remains the Enron disaster...    ...with Mr. L=
ay not showing up to testify in front of Congress, and attempting to dodge =
a subpoena.  The Enron fallout continues to threaten not only the wholesale=
 energy trading sector but the energy sector as a whole as companies retren=

If the following occurs, USGT will put in a "Final" nom after confirming with all gas controls that we can physically make this happen.  Oasis and/or Transok will confirm prior to the confirmation online deadline for the final.  USGT will also fax the info to NNG's Gas Control and to the South Central team.

It is most likely that this nomination have the notation of  "invalid transaction" so we need to make sure with whoever is running the final they are aware of what's going on -- like the North team advises us of Minnegasco's changes when they occur.

Now that I've probably confused everyone, I am going home.  Let me know Thursday if anyone has any questions -- thanks.

Since NNG is allocating storage you may get a call from USGT wanting to bring gas into NNG from Transok or Oasis going to TW. If they do they will  get all  parties on the phone and make sure everyone agrees to start flow real time at receipt and delivery point. Also USGT would need to fax a nomination into gas control the following morning so that it is accounted for. (Like we do with Minnigasco) Be sure and log this and let your relief know so that we don't miss it the next morning.

There is an OBA Payback nomination at two points, POI 1709 Linam Ranch and POI 152 Reeves.  The payback is for 5,000 dth/day at both points.  One is a receipt to NNG (Reeves) and the other is a delivery to Duke (Linam Ranch).  Since NNG controls Reeves there should not be any problems there, but at Linam Ranch, Duke operates the point.  Please give me or someone on the South Central team a call if Linam Ranch is running over their order so we can call the scheduler and have them make corrections to their volumes.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Randy Janzen


New scheduler for Duke is Wayne Hawkins - 915-620-4214,

Charlie & Wayne,
I did get some more displacement points from Gas Control today so here is the  updated list.
I wanted to be sure the TMS validations for the displacement groups is added in your coding. We will set up the displacement group. Call it "Dispacement IT Group" which should be a valid receipt and delivery group for IT contrcts. The other Displacement group is called Displacement SP Group. This group will need to follow the same rules and validations for pools(point is only valid for the basin that it belongs to). Also, this group is only valid as a receipt group for SP contracts. 

The Bi-dierctional points will not need a list since TMS will read the point flow indicator of "B" & allow both receipts & deliveries to be nominated for "IT" contracts. Any Bi-directional points on Firm  will have the points tied directly to the contract or be in a group that is ties to the Firm contract.

Linda & Darrell, please review this list & make sure it is correct
 

Thanks Ramona

Ramona,

We are only tying point groups to firm contracts, IT contracts will validate against PLE.  I think we need to set up a displacement group for Charlie to validate any contract against for displacement puposes.  If this is not what is happening or we need to discuss further please let me know.

Thanks

All,
I have completed the review of the TW Displacement points and the Bi-Directional pts. and have attached a file with the points.
When reviewing the data, I have found the all points are tied to the current "All Receipts Pt. Template" correctly. My file also indicated that TW only set up this process for "IT" Interruptible contracts. If we show all the points today on the All receipt point group and the "IT" contracts have that group attached, then we should not need a new group. This would still allow marketing the flexability to allow  firm contracts to use  diplacement points or bi-directional points as alternates on a case by case and point by point basis if needed by amending the firm to add a new specific alternate point to the contract.

Thanks Ramona

How are we doing in setting up displacement point group? We would need that for the alternate point testing.

Udate on MOPS continued: 
The repairs are on hold for now until weather conditions improve. currently there are rough seas off shore. The crew is on sight and will contintue work as weather permits. It is highly unlikely that the MOPS system will be back up and running this weekend. according to the conference call the marine forecast will continue to be rough through the weekend.

Subject:	 MOPS Update



The South Central Team has been fielding several calls from customers regarding the status of MOPS, Cara and Chris were invited to conference with the Tivoli Area and the crew working on the leak.

The latest information as of 11:00 am Wednesday 2/13/02 is as follows:

Operations:
The earliest the MOPS system will be unavailable this Saturday 2/16/02 (  best estimate )

The diving crew has located the exact source of the leak, and they are continuing repairs.  Right now the weather condition's look favorable and the forecast predicts that the good conditions should continue.  The leak is located 160 feet below the surface which presents complications no matter the weather conditions.

At least one member of the South Central Team will listen in on the daily conference call (11:00 am Central Time) and will keep everyone updated; this should help improve the accuracy and timeliness of our information.

Scheduling:

Darrell will set the operational capacity to 0 through the 18th on the delivery locations. If the MOPS system come back on before that time the operational capacities can be brought up. This information is available on the bulletin board.

Remember to post as a FORCE MAJEURE on the allocations. If receipt points (ex:platform 762) update the point and their deliveries will be cut.  

Some customers have been calling and inquiring if they should nom. gas in the MOPS system. Noming gas is at the shippers discretion, as long as the system is down we will continue to confirm their gas to 0 and allocated the delivery points.   Please direct them to the bulletin board.  It is ok to let them know of our timeline, please stress that this is an estimate.  If you are not comfortable answering any question, please direct them to myself (5-2871), Chris (3-4826) Sherry (3-3063), or Bob Burleson (713-287-1049)

We will keep up updated as the MOPS situation continues. Cara will be on comp days Thurs and Friday-- Chris and Sherry will cover my desk and MOPS in my absence. 

Thanks,
Cara and Chris

I have been working closely with OneOk Westex this month in order to balance their OBA at Reeves and to date we are still approximately 17,000 dth over delivered to them.  

Gary Spraggins approved and OneOk agreed to NNG set the flow control to them at 2,000 dth less that their scheduled to make this up for rest of the month.

Roy Armitage in NNG Gas Control was contacted and has made the adjustments.

Any questions, please call.

	FYI.  I would still like the On Call TW Scheduler to dial in at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday
	and Sunday to review status of the computer systems and any major concerns.
	If there are major concerns, we will probably not discuss them until the NNG 
	meeting is over and the NNG Marketers are off the phone line.  At that time
	we can call the On Call TW Marketing Rep if needed.  

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

As many of you know, yesterday we closed on Dynegy's option to acquire Northern Natural.  Shortly, a more comprehensive message will be distributed about that transaction and what it means for all of us.  

One important requirement under that transaction is that Enron Operations Services Company has agreed to continue providing certain services to Northern consistent with our past operations.  Northern will be billed for those services, and we will be required to demonstrate the basis for those billings.  

Effective, Feb. 1, all employees in the ETS family of companies that perform any services for Northern or related to Northern's operations in any way should keep timesheets documenting the amount of time spent on Northern projects or supporting personnel and activities related to Northern projects.  

If there are any questions about this requirement, please communicate with your department head or with me.  Thanks for your help in implementing this important requirement.  

Jim

All testing was completed, but we encountered problems with accessing the Flow Gas testing.  We have notified the Business Objects On-call, and we will provide an update as it's available.  We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.

I received a call from Darrel Belt with the South Sioux team, he said that Terra Chemical's chromatograph has quit working and they are needing to know what the BTU is running for their operation.  We can give them the reading at South Sioux City from stream 2050, which is the Hooper C line.  They will be calling for this reading every 3 hours until Monday best estimate for repairs.  The easiest way to find it is NORTH REGION CHROMATOGRAPH then it is the first one on the list.

Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

Once all the cost associated with this project role up....  I would ask that you provide the detail and total of that role up so that I can proceed with the information to marketing (Mark McConnel) who will be charged with communicating/billing to Citizens.  Also, how/when will I know that the Kingman Team is credited with this billing?

Tim, I know we have the budget crunch and meetings this week, but when you get time per our conversation yesterday, please provide the Project Tracking Number for the Citizens Griffith RTU modifications to the folks listed above.  As long as we have this number available before timesheets are due we should be alright.  

All, this number should be used to track all of your labor, traveling expenses and/or any material required for this project.

At this point the modifications continuing forward for a Friday morning installation.  Citizens has been advised of the schedule and Darryl Scoolcraft has been notified.  Scott and Russ, please make sure you contact the gas control desk just prior to implementing the changes so they can be standing by.  Citizens has notified El Paso of the planned changes and timeline so that they are prepared to make up any volumes should a problem occur.  Scott and/or Russ will provide gas control with the register number to access the variable pressure setpoint remotely.  Darryl has requested that we initially set the pressure control at no lower than 680 to 700#'s.     Let me know if anyone has questions.

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.  

Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.

Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.  

As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Questions or concerns????

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

The Telephony Team performed maintenance over the weekend which impacted the user voicemail that moved from 3AC.  Although the Telephony Group is working on restoring the voicemail the problem may not be resolved before Friday.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

On January 29, 2002, Enron named Stephen F. Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. To keep employees informed about developments, Mr. Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January 29 and February 8.   Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcripts of those messages.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Friday, February 8, 2002

Hi everybody.  This is Steve Cooper.  It's about 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock Houston time, Friday afternoon.  It's been a pretty hectic week, but I'd like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with what's gone on this last week.

Beginning last weekend, the Board's special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report - in fact it's about 200 odd pages, and it's fairly pointed and blunt.  The report was troubling, and as I'm sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week, its findings have further dented our corporate history.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job I'm paid to do, and hopefully, the job all of you are getting paid to do, is to look forward and proceed that way at 100 percent full speed.  I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to.

The committee and the report didn't offer any specific recommendations.  Rather, it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years.  Enron's board, management and Creditors' Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports' findings and take whatever action is required.  I, like many of you, am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company, we're going to have to have a management team in place that is credible, that's committed to moving forward for the future, that is trusted by our outside constituents, and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work.  Next week, after the Board meeting, I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company.

The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing.  And obviously, this has been translated into the daily headlines.  Hopefully, these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron.  And with this, I'm sure we'll be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward - not only for Enron - but for other corporations.  This situation, I believe, will have a national impact.

It's going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business - in fact it already has.
It's going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules.
It's going to put more teeth into the SEC,.
ARISA is going to be modified.
There's not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites.

During the last week I've spent almost all my time dealing with the company's Creditors' Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking, concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda, a free flow of information, a free flow of communications, and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron.  As I continue to look at our various businesses, I'm as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us, if everybody is reasonable and responsible, and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized.

In any event, I'll continue to keep you updated as we move forward.  In the meantime, if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else that's on your mind, don't hesitate to either send me an e-mail or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible.  If my response isn't satisfactory the first time around - just buzz me again.

Listen everyone, have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston.  Bye-bye.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Tuesday, January 29, 2002

Good morning everyone, this is Steve Cooper ? it's the morning of January 29th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enron's interim CEO.  My firm, Zolfo Cooper, my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process.  I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward.

I can't imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you.  I'm sure it's been incredibly difficult, particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched.  In that environment, I've got to believe it's difficult, if not impossible, for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization.

I'm not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning, however, I'd like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this.

It's been the experience of myself, my firm, my partners, that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy, we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings.  Those metrics are typically the organization, the asset base that the company has to bring to bear, customer base, and liquidity.  From what I've been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here, Enron has a very, very bright, very capable, very committed, hardworking and dedicated organization.  All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize, restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy.

Number 2, the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here.  The regulated assets, the pipelines, the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around.

Third, loyal customers.  Most of Enron's customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis.

And fourth, liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand, the cash it expects to generate in the near term, and with the backstop of the DIP financing, it doesn't appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward.

With those four resources nicely in place, I'm very confident that we can successfully restructure this company.  I don't want to leave the impression that it will be easy.  It's going to be an enormous amount of work.  There will be upsets, issues, and concerns along the way.  But I can tell you that I've seen companies in bankruptcy that don't have nearly as strong a position as this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy, and I'm certain Enron will also.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and I'm very pleased to be here.  Jeff, Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward.  If there are any thoughts, concerns, issues that you would like to bring to my attention, please don't hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to working with all of you.

Cornbelt called and said they have an outage on Friday the 8th. They would like for us to limit Hubbard to 4000 hp from 9am to 16pm. Pierre will go out and put the limits into the program. Also, all the Waterloo units are available, however, if unit # 6 is needed they need to balance the power cylinders.

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Thanks
Mike

Bisti was down for 55 min, and the pig went by Bisti @ 10:26 MST.  Data at each valve site retreved off RTUs.   If you have any questions or comments, please call.
                              
                                                                                                             Thanks,     -Brian-

Randy, the time table you have for this outage  is 02/26 to 02/28 to replace a section of the exhaust header. If we have cold temps the first part of the week, can this outage be pushed back a few days? 

Jerry

The decision has been made based on the latest smartpig results that the operating pressure for the pipeline section from Station 8 to Station 6 is not to exceed 939 psi until the actual status of the pipeline can be evaluated based upon the smartpig information and any necessary repairs can be made.

Additionally, a conference call for Friday (2-15) at 2:PM CST has been established to initiate discussions regarding excavations and possible repairs that may be needed.  Conference number is 877-795-3687 Code 724709.

Everyone plz try to participate in this call if at all possible.

Max, 
I'll put all of these on the outage list, and we'll keep an eye on them as they get closer. I not sure we want to have the digs in the same time frame as our San Juan outages, Bisti, Gallop, LaPlata, and Bloomfield turn arounds, (4/2 to 4/13). I'm going to visit with Darrell and see if we want to move them out of that time frame.

Jerry

David, 
Here is our efficiency analysis from the online model.  This is just for the Bisti to Gallup section. The other sections have comparable results.
You can see that before the pigging the average efficiency were at 1.005 and after the pigging it rose to 1.04. Thus, a 4% increase in efficiency. However I see a gradual decreasing trend towards 1.035 just less than a week after the pigging.
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
ben

Ben, I understand the team collected pressure data at the mainline valves on the SJ lateral and forwarded to you all Tuesday.  Have you had the opportunity to calculate the current eff. following the dry pig run made last week?

Gallup, please provide digital pictures if possible and of course quantities of liquids and/or solids received.

Ben, I assume you be able to provide the post pigging effeciency on the lateral so we can continue to evaluate the timing of the DRA application?

Thanks for the detailed info Earl.  

One question,, 702#'s for welding?  In speaking with Darryl I got the impression that we would have the Ignacio Lateral at a "0" flow rate for the tie-ins.  (So I assumed a cut out)  Since we will be Hot Tapping, are you comfortable with no flow during the welding?  If not, I guess we can vent gas at the hub during the welding.  Either way we will probably have a minimum of two team members on location while welding and tapping is occuring.  (These men are the impact to the work force at LaPlata that Operations will be working around)  However, this is NOT a problem.  It just may impact the current work plan at La Plata... 

Unless I am confused, I don't know that we can get the pressure down to 702#'s on this line unless we shut in the customers and go to "0" flow?  Am I missing something Team or Darryl?  

Again, thanks for the quick feedback...

Subject:	Re: Questar IC

Earl, we noted in a weekly report that this IC was approved for construction with a May 1st startup date.  [Chanley, Earl]  David, the IC has not been approved to date, a PA has been submitted and is being routed for approvals.   We gave a heads up to Jerry and Darryl that a potential interruption to flow could occur in the near future as a result of tie-ins for this IC.  Jerry and Darryl then requested that the tie-ins be made during our LaPlata outage which is a three day outage during April 2nd, 3rd, & 4th.   [Chanley, Earl]   Talked with Darrel and the Hot tap date will coordinate with other outage of April 2, 2002. Line pressure has to be lowered to 702# for welding.  I asked that Jerry and Darryl discuss the time frame of tie-ins for Questar with you, as I could not say one way or the other if you could mobilize by then.  [Chanley, Earl]   trying to get material ASAP for tap. Working on details of who buys material for the IC. Will know more next week.  

Jerry/Darryl, I did however, discuss with the Team to determine if the tie-ins occured during the same time frame as the La Plata outage, what would be the impact to manpower and scheduling of tasks at La Plata.  The Team committed to the tie-ins during the same time frame but will be asking for 4 days of down time at La Plata now versus the 3 days origianlly requested.  They will look at options such as contract labor, support team, etc... to see if they can squeeze this back to three days, but it will be a few weeks before that information is communicated.   [Chanley, Earl]  David, E&C will have the contract crews, Inspector and others in place to lessen the impact to their schedule.   [Chanley, Earl]  The team choice to extend the outage should not be based on the tap as E&C will supply any support needed, if the team has concerns, contact me and we will work them out.  

Chris Gaston will be the team point of contact for the Questar tie-ins...  Blackie Foutz will be the Team point person for measurment related issues related to design/installation.

Earl, can you provide the team with the work order number so that payroll can be charged as they become involved?   [Chanley, Earl]  As soon as it is approved and funded.  Also, can you provide the tentative date of commissioning the interconnect so that we can insure George Kniesley is available to participate along with the team.   [Chanley, Earl]  IN service is requested for May 1, 02, but will know more after meeting with Questar on who will purchase material and build.  
 
Team, charge time to the work order only as support is requested from E&C and/or is necessary as part of start up and commissioning.  

If I can do anything to help, please give me a call...

Jack Ohearn with Questar and Roswell E&C will meet at the Bloomfield station on 2-20-02 @ 8:00 am to determine where the interconnect will be located, TW or Questar right of way. All of the details of the IC are being worked out and TW is to own and operate at this time. Locations, design, who is to construct and equipment are issues being resolved at this time. 
If you have any questions, please let me know next week. 
I'm not sure of who the team contact will be on this project, but if the team or contact has other commitments, this meeting is to resolve the location and the team's impute is welcome. 

Thanks

Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.

 




Note:

Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.  The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.

This difference is mainly due to the following:
$10.0m   -   negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
$ 2.7m   -    SoCal rate issue - $not collected
$ 1.8m   -    additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.  

Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

Please call me at x36709 if there are questions

thanks,
richard

Karen - do you have anything on POI 500168?  It is set up as a delivery only in PLE.

500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  Karen was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active
       status.
If any other questions please call

POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The following points need updating in PLE

1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas
500168 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE as such to be picked up in TMS

I spoke with Paul Haas with Kinder Morgan (NGPL) today about this.  He said it is not NGPL's intention to ever shut this point in if TW is overdelivering, only to cut the point back to rate.  He pledged their continued cooperation and as a followup, Darrell Schoolcraft and I have a conference call with Paul and Darrell's countepart scheduled for Tuesday, 2/19 to discuss the operation of TW/NGPL points and possible payback of volumes on the OBA.

Randy - if you have anything in particular that you would like us to bring up during the call, please call Darrell.  Thanks.

Lorraine,

Would you please have a conversation with KMI about Randy's concern of KMI shutting in the Gray I/C w/o notifying us and the problems it would cause at P-3.  Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.

Thanks, Kim.

I've just been included in some discussion about this interconnect.  Apparently Kinder-Morgan wants to put a control valve downstream of our measurement point.  They want to do this to have some control of deliveries off TW onto their system.  They have some concern about over-deliveries.  I understand that this happened on a couple of occassions in the past (possibly due to a malfunction with our valve).  They assure us that this control valve is only to provide them with the protection against over delivery.
It would be set to flow at a rate equal to their nomination, I guess.  
As I said, they intend to set this valve downstream of measurement, on their pipe.  Since it will be installed on their pipe, I don't think there's much we can do about it.
However, we were wondering if there can be some wording or agreement formalized that says they would not shut this point in before contacting our field personnel and/or gas control.  I don't think this is their intention, but if they did shut in without notification, it would cause problems at our P-3 station.
We've tried to talk them out of this installation, but they seem adamant to proceed.
I wasn't sure who to contact about this.  Could you let me know if this is a major concern with marketing and scheduling?
Thanks

All
Per Darrell and Jerry's comments below, we can proceed with the unloader installation at any time. I talked to Ed and had a message from Jon. Jon is tied up in Florida through the 22nd, probably. He can be at Station 8 the week of the 25th. He'll check and confirm that.

Gene and I talked and we'll plan on doing the install on both units (one at a time) the week of the 25th.

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Thanks
Mike

POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The following points need updating in PLE

1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas
500168 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE as such to be picked up in TMS

Hey Bud, if we wait until March before dry pigging and then give it two weeks before considering a re-application, it's cutting it awfully close to do something in April.  If you would, stay on top of this one for us and let me or the Team know if you see a window for a one hour outage at Bisti to allow the dry pigging to proceed in February.  I understand the tariff situation and I sure as heck don't want to get you in a bind... Just keep your eyes open for an opportunity.. Thanks

Also, the outage info for SJ/La Plata & Bisti was received today.  The current plan included total outages at each station.  Although this is probably OK for Bisti and La Plata, I did ask that the Team speak directly with you and get your thoughts on how you would like to stager the Bloomfield units given that you may not want all equipment down at one time, even if the outage only took 3 days with this approach.  Tempting isn't it?  I will get with you and the Team again Friday afternoon if the tentative schedule has not been resolved by that time.  Thanks.....

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

The estimated throughput affected (at the pig speed of 5-7 mph) was about 600mmcfd. The run time was 18 hrs for the DRA.
But we will monitor the efficiencies for two weeks after the pigging before considering the DRA re-application. I suggest we probably prepare for that in case we have do it.
Thx

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.  

Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.

Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.  

As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Questions or concerns????

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

Ben, I assume you be able to provide the post pigging effeciency on the lateral so we can continue to evaluate the timing of the DRA application?

I don't have an outage for fuel valve replacement yet. Would that need to be done during the scheduled turn around?

Has there been an outage scheduled to replace the fuel valve on unit 2 at La Plata?

Todd, where do we stand with the station control modifications?

Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)

What better time to make this request.  For those of you that wish, the Albuquerque Region is taking up a collection to give Rich a Grand going away gift.  There are 70 plus employees in the Region and our goal is to collect enough in donations to get Rich a "______", (can't tell you just yet.  Wouldn't want it to leak out and get back to Rich)  Besides, depending on the generousity of your donation we may or may not be able to meet our objective.. 

Please make collections at each work location for those interested in donating and have your checks or cash mailed to the Flagstaff Team office by Friday, January 25th.  Mail to the attention of David Roensch or Tracy Kuehl.

I don't mind giving you a overview of the unsubsribed CAS process, this afternoon.  I would suggest we have the meeting in my office at EB 4082, so I can demo the screens.  Buzz, if you are free it might be a meeting you would want to attend.

Due to Ramona being out Friday, I would like to keep this CAS overview scheduled for today, Thursday afternoon, from 1:30 to 3pm.  Ramona will be available for only a short time today.  Perry, if you don't mind, for today, could you show Jerry Skertich and I a CAS overview from your viewpoint.  Darrell, perhaps Jerry and I can get with you either tomorrow or sometime next week to get your viewpoint.  

Please let me know if everyone is okay with meeting today for about an hour.  I will see if I can get room 3907 for this afternoon.  Thx, Jim

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

Larry Bertholf at Holcomb called today saying that this point was running 22# of water at about 1,000 mmbtu/d flow rate. He has notified the contract pumper that it will be shut-in tomorrow if it is not fixed. I have notified Jerry Knight (Oneok) and he will get a hold of his contacts with the supplier. Oneok is buying the gas at this point. I have already set the capacity at zero if he does shut it in Friday.

It is with sincere sadness that I inform you of a tragedy that occurred.  Doug Hammer, an Enron Northern Natural Gas senior operations and maintenance technician located at the LNG facility in Wrenshall, Minnesota, died earlier this week.  Doug gave many years of dedicated service to EOTT and most recently Northern Natural Gas.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Doug's family.
 
Recognizing this is a difficult time for us all, the Enron Employee Assistance Program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Please call 713.853.6057, or 1.800.345.1391 for assistance.  

Additional information about the program is also available via the Enron intranet site at: <http://hrweb.enron.com/employeeServices/workLife/resourcesReferrals.asp>

Jeanne,
In talking with Mark McConnell, Jerry Graves and Darrell Schoolcraft we think that if you can have David Duff pull the following point operational capacity out of TCI we can determine what Mark needs.  Please go back as far as you can in the database.  Some points may not exist because they were not in place back in 93 or 94, but pull as much history as you can. 
	Name			POI           
	SoCal - Topock		0056697
	SoCal - Needles		0010487
	PG&E - Topock		0056698
	S.W. Willow Valley	0013198
	N. Starsteel		0500383
	Mojave - Topock		0056696
	Citizen - Kingman	0056659
	Citizen - 89 North	0500046
	Citizen - Forest Branch	0500619
	Citizens - Flagstaff	0500134


Darrell, Jerry and I would like to validate the information prior to forwarding to Mark, so please send me the file and I will coordinate the review.  It might be helpful to know the field names in TCI if you can't find operational capacity.  We probably called it something different back then.

Thank you for your help.
Donna

All
Per Darrell and Jerry's comments below, we can proceed with the unloader installation at any time. I talked to Ed and had a message from Jon. Jon is tied up in Florida through the 22nd, probably. He can be at Station 8 the week of the 25th. He'll check and confirm that.

Gene and I talked and we'll plan on doing the install on both units (one at a time) the week of the 25th.

Thanks
Mike

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Thanks
Mike

I am having Dale set alarm limits on TBS gas temperatures. Several heaters blew out due to high winds in Minnesota today. Minnegasco noticed the low gas temps and reported them to the Field. The low alarm will be set at 20 degrees and the low low at 10 degrees. You should call the Field if you get a low alarm and if the gas temperature keeps trending down. Also, in the future, if Minnegasco notices low gas temperatures, they will call in to Gas Control, and we will make the call out to the Field. thanks. sj

3,000/day is being schedule at Wolf Creek and we are not receiving volume thus increasing Continental's imbalance.

Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled?

Hello everyone, I am putting together a few things for the meeting on March 7. I need to get a head count on who will be attending the meeting, joining us for dinner and also who will be joining us for the golf outing. If you need hotel suggestions please let me know. We will have the golf outing on the 6th followed by dinner. The outage meeting will still be on the 7th.

Please let me know ASAP and I will be sending out additional information the end of this week or early next week.
Thank you

Dan,
We will have pipeline repairs to do on the mainline in sections 7 & 8,  bet=
ween Stations 6 and 8.  PII is running a LAPA program on the smart pig resu=
lts from the pigs ran last September.  Once the LAPA results are complete, =
probably within the next 2 weeks, Earl Chanley will put together a scope an=
d estimate of work.  We don't have a date for the work yet, but probably wi=
ll be in the May/June time frame.  These smart pig runs are a part of Trans=
western's Risk Management Demo Project with OPS.  We will probably have to =
take the mainline to 60% MAOP for repairs, so there is a possibility for fl=
ow restrictions. =20
We also have budgeted to smart pig the Crawford Lateral this year.  Regulat=
ing flow for the proper pig speed may cause flow restrictions.  We don't ha=
ve a date for this pig run yet.  I'll work with Jeff, Max Brown, Darrell Sc=
hoolcraft, and Earl Chanley to schedule this and the pipeline repairs in se=
ction 7 & 8.
Thanks,  Arnie

John
Starting Feb. 1 the GPM Tekas Bradshaw volumes (15,000 mmbtu/d) have gone away. I understand that GPM is trying to reroute this gas to another plant. So at this point this gas may or may not come back into NNG. Currently CIG has an order of 37,000 mmbtu/d. What affect will this have on Oneok Bushton processing (if any) with the Tekas gas going away?

Thanks Gary

The excavation has started at the red rock tie-in point at Station 1 (Kingman) for the new compressor. Depending on flows out west, we need to try and hold the suction pressure at station 1 under 806 with a differential no greater than 190lbs. Plant personnel and Gas Control will be monitoring the pressure during the day hours. After hours, until 5:00 pm and on Week-ends.  Gas Control will need to contact Larry Meeks who is the contractor on site and his number is 928-753-7145.

Thanks for relaying this again.........Just make them aware this is sending out several Critical e-mails for each point every time they forget to change the reason code.

One more thing, if you are uncertain as to what allocation code to put on the point or group being allocated or the information was not relayed to you from one shift to another. Please ask or call one of the Gas Control Team Advisors or Scheduling Team Advisors prior to allocating. This will assure that all individuals are using the same code for all cycles. If you have questions, please ask. Thank you.

For the remainder of the Mops outage or until Gary or Darrell tell you otherwise, make sure that you select "FMJ" for every "CYCLE", while we are allocating. As this can and will cause confusion to the shippers and operators when they look at the posting on the EBB. As, we don't want the posting to be "Critical" one time and the next time "NOT Critical" the next. If you have questions, please ask. Thank you.

Darrell,

I have two questons for you.  First of all, New Mexico Natural Gas is disputing the allocation and stating some operational reasons, and they would like to talk to you.  Also, Phillips is interested in our Park service, and would like some information.  I know where the rates are posted on the web site, but is there other information I should give them?  

Thanks,
Christine

I contacted Jamie Scnorf this morning, she forgot to send the daily burn order via email yesterday. She tried to send it this morning but for some reason it was returned to her. Per Jamie there is no change to the 60,000 order,  evidently there is a problem with the internet as she has tried to send this out several times this morning and we still haven't received it. (We'll probably get them all at once)

Jerry ,  I would like to tentatively schedule an outage to tie in the station surge control at P3.  We will need 2 days.  We will need to remove some material that we are going to reuse and test it before we can make our tie-ins.  We would like to schedule this for Tuesday, Feb. 19 at 8:00 a.m. and ending Wed. Feb. 20 at 5:00 p.m., 2002. 

The Pampa Team will be sending you an outage report.

The estimated throughput affected (at the pig speed of 5-7 mph) was about 600mmcfd. The run time was 18 hrs for the DRA.
But we will monitor the efficiencies for two weeks after the pigging before considering the DRA re-application. I suggest we probably prepare for that in case we have do it.
Thx

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.  

Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.

Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.  

As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Questions or concerns????

Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)

The fuel valve replacement is scheduled for April 2nd, in order to accommodate everyone's schedule, contractors, Solar representatives, regional field engineers, etc..  This will coincide with our annual turnaround, which is scheduled for April 2nd through the 5th.  Unit A-102 is currently running in the normal solonox mode to prevent any compliance issues, but is being operated at a reduced RPM.  Hopefully this will satisfy all interests until repairs can be made.  If you have any questions, please call us @ (970) 259-8238.

I don't have an outage for fuel valve replacement yet. Would that need to be done during the scheduled turn around?

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.  Each block of numbers will experience an outage of a few minutes during which calls made to an affected number will not go through and will not roll to voice mail.  The numbers affected are: 345-5000...6999; 713-646-6000...6599; 713-646-7000...7999; 713-646-8200...8399; 713-646-8600..8699; 713-646-9700...9799; 713-345-0200...2999.  The number 713-345-7000 to access voice mail will not be affected by this maintenance.  However, any number within these maintenance groups will be affected regardless of whether it was moved from 3AC.  This change will impact ETS users.

Earlier today, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message.

------------------------------------------------------
Voicemail Transcript - Steve Cooper
February 14, 2002

Hi everybody, this is Steve Cooper.  It is February 14, so Happy Valentine's Day to everybody. I just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - I want to make sure that I keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what's going on.

First of all, I want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails.  They've been very supportive and I thank you for that.  I do intend to get back to everybody personally -- I've just been busy and jammed up this week, but I do want you to know I really appreciate it.  It's been a little hectic this week, so I do apologize for the delay in getting back to you.

Anyway, a couple of things have happened this week and I just want to make sure everybody understands what they are.  Number one is the result of the special investigative report.  We're beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result Rick Buy and Rick Causey's employment with the company has been terminated.  To the extent that there are any additional changes, obviously I'll keep you up to speed.

We're also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the Board.  Six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days.  We're initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors, which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted.

At the Board meeting this week, I reiterated that it's my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor's committee by the second quarter, and nothing that I see today leads me conclude that we can't make that schedule.  I continue to believe that there is a very nice re-organizable platform here, so that the company can move forward.

There was some bad news with respect to Enron stock.  As far as I can tell, the claims base here - that is bank debt, bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward.  As a result, it's not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders.  That's not good news.  It's an unfortunate result of this problem, and I wish it was different.  But I don't want you to be misled and I don't want any of you to believe that there is value there, because I don't think there will be.  In particular I don't want you to continue to invest your earnings in Enron stock without being aware of, at least in my view, shareholder value at the end of the day.

The media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation.  I don't believe that will be the case here.  I think we have a tough road to hoe.  I think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team.  None the less, I do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here, and I'm absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen.

A couple of other things that I want you to be aware of:  as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team, we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles, responsibilities are.

We are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program, which I know is important to all of you.  As that gets cemented, I will provide you with additional updates.  

And another thing, I've asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid-March, an employee meeting at one of these local hotels.  It will, more likely than not, be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go.  What I thought we would do is give everybody, in a plain vanilla way, a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there.  Then we will have a giant question and answer session, so that if any of you have concerns, issues, problems, or upsets, we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things.

That's where we stand as of Valentine's Day.  Once again, I would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support. Again, I apologize that I haven't been able to get back to you as quickly as I would like, but I promise you I will and I hope everybody has a great day.

If you have any questions or issues, send me an email, give me a buzz or drop by my office.  I would be more than happy to have a chat with you.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Thanks again so much and I'll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible.

Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These "5" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate "5" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.

Attached in the NNG Measurement Log for Feb. 2002.  I have only attached the Log items for Feb. 02 to see this will try and eliminate the trouble some field locations are having opening the complete file.  Please let me know if this helps.  In the future I will try and only send current month activity and any other open items.  If needed a copy of the entire file can be sent.  Please review and provide any comments.

Tim, I know we have the budget crunch and meetings this week, but when you get time per our conversation yesterday, please provide the Project Tracking Number for the Citizens Griffith RTU modifications to the folks listed above.  As long as we have this number available before timesheets are due we should be alright.  

All, this number should be used to track all of your labor, traveling expenses and/or any material required for this project.

At this point the modifications continuing forward for a Friday morning installation.  Citizens has been advised of the schedule and Darryl Scoolcraft has been notified.  Scott and Russ, please make sure you contact the gas control desk just prior to implementing the changes so they can be standing by.  Citizens has notified El Paso of the planned changes and timeline so that they are prepared to make up any volumes should a problem occur.  Scott and/or Russ will provide gas control with the register number to access the variable pressure setpoint remotely.  Darryl has requested that we initially set the pressure control at no lower than 680 to 700#'s.     Let me know if anyone has questions.
