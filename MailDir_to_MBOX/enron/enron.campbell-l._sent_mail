The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine 
replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount 
levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality 
Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty 
to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are 
on this.

The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the 
State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity 
generators of hazardous waste in Arizona.

Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New 
Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico.

A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to 
discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like 
for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to 
substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the 
State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy 
all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract 
attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue. 

Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be 
made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine 
status of permit compliance with each air permit.

  Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson

  Due to the great consternation caused by the
  revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my
  obligation to give an explanation to the
  population for my act of copulation.

  I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of
  sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through
  masturbation, resulted in my fornication.
   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with
  excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and
  liberation.

  She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I
  wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for
  duplication but I insisted upon
  termination, in spite of her fascination with
  variation.

  This has caused me great aggravation, and the
  agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in
  my humiliation, denigration, and
  degradation. My wife is considering castration, which
  would require my hospitalization.

  Pray that this matter will find culmination in my
  sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for
  nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in
  revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation
  has provided illumination and verification and will
  prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

  Sincerely,
  The Rev. Jesse Jackson

 Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20
status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 9=
8%=20
complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the=
=20
month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20
Region.  However, until the site visits are completed, this should give you=
 a=20
good idea of the status of the EOTT pipeline tanks stand with respect to ai=
r=20
compliance. =20

1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tan=
ks=20
at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EO=
TT=20
Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise=20
listed in error, were removed (and saved in another file).  Of the 106 tank=
s=20
listed, 80 are active, 12 are inactive, 10 are permanently out-of-service,=
=20
and 4 are abandoned in place.

=20
2. Permit issues.=20
Federal

a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps a=
re=20
the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the=20
tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit)=
. =20
This statement is based on =01&worst case=018 calculations using EPA TANKS =
4.0=20
which indicated that in a:

5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 7=
20=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 t=
py=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 9 tons (6 tpy breathing loss, 3 tpy=
=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e.,=
=20
255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3=
=20
tpy working loss).=20


State=20

b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) o=
f=20
the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or=20
reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long=
=20
as throughputs do not significantly change. =20

All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed=
=20
after 1971 and equipped with a floating roof are exempt under Standard=20
Exemption 86, currently known as Permit-by-Rule 106.478.   None of the tank=
s=20
store material with a true vapor pressure above 11.0 psia, and total actual=
=20
VOC emissions authorized under exemption from any site does not exceed the =
30=20
TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary=
,=20
since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone.

New Mexico=01,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being=20
developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT=
=20
tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalize=
d,=20
the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent=
=20
than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floati=
ng=20
roof would be authorized to store petroleum product with a true vapor=20
pressure up to 11.0 psia.   Only the four fixed roof tanks at Maljamar and=
=20
the one at Loco Hills could be affected.=20

4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no=20
requirements. For tanks subject to NSPS Subpart K, only capacity data is=20
required.  Tanks subject to Ka and Kb require inspection, repairs if=20
warranted, and recordkeeping. =20

Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer=01,s=
=20
identification plate or=20
strapping table is available.  I would suggest that we pursue a records=20
search of old EOTT files to verify construction dates.  I dont know where t=
o=20
start on this.

5. Specific compliance/requirements summary.  The tabled information=20
identifies the following:

Federal
- 2 tanks (McElroy 58005, Loco Hills 4602) may not be meeting NSPS control=
=20
requirements
- 4 tanks (Maljamar 1519-1522)  may not be meeting NSPS control requirement=
s

(All are cone tanks,  subject to Ka/Kb.  Based on a capacity > 472 bbls and=

Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be 
meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement 
or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for 
employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the 
Foundation.  

Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the 
facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification 
report submittals.

Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff 
teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of 
hazardous waste.

Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, 
for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred 
in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and 
assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was 
Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a 
larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components 
(inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically 
adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern 
received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine 
capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, 
EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding 
as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to 
review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
request another hearing.

Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit 
issue:

[Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.]

I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to 
another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly 
suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, 
Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ 
compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back 
from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, 
tomorrow.

Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to 
have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air 
permits:

 all earthwork
 trench construction and piping tie ins
 all foundation and building construction
 installation of ancillary equipment

This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may 
allow us to do.

The EPA contact for the Sta. 3 and 4 air permits: permit engineer  Roger 
Cohn      (415) 744-1238
      Supervisor  Geraldo Rios    (415) 744-1259

The ADEQ contact for Sta. 1 and 2 air permit permit engineer  Shudeish 
Mahadev (?)   (602) 207-2323
      Director   Nancy Wrona

Roger, thats great that the public notice for station 3 and 4 air permits 
will initiate on October 4.  I really appreciate your work and effort on 
this. I will be looking forward to reviewing the rough draft for both of the 
permits during the first week of October.....

Larry,

An advertisement in the Navajo Times on October 4 will start the 30-day
public comment period for the Leupp and Klagetoh permit mods.  We will send
you copies of the draft permits and statements of basis, which you should
receive a day or two before October 4.

I will be out of the office until October 22.  If you have any questions
about these permits in my absence, please call Gerardo Rios at

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which 
we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal 
with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

Larry, per our phone conversation tonight.  I found this article interesting, 
especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.  Note the section 
below in bold Red text.  Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just 
across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff 
off Interstate 15.  This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW's 
but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving 
these areas.....   Anyhow, fyi...  (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust & The 
Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)  



New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter
07/29/2001

  |
Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's "crown jewels" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

"We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community," said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. "Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands."

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

"We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund."

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

"In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us."

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

"State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education," the
document reads. "... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools."

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

"I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent."

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

"It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community," Smith said. "Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them."

The State of New Mexico conducted a surprise air inspection of the TW Atoka 
No.3 C/S.  The agency found no non compliance issues or violoations during 
the inspection.

The second quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee meeting was 
held this week.  Transwestern's share of the PCB management and disposal 
activities on the SoCal system for the quarter was $125,950.00.

The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine 
replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  The original amount levied against 
Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this 
issue for more than 4 years without resolution, they reassessed the penalty 
to be $162,770.   A conference call will be set up to discuss Transwestern's 
next course of action.

The summary report for due diligence conducted in Portland Ore. was completed 
and submitted to Environmental Affairs in Houston.

Jerry, I have not cancelled the Station 4 air permit.  I have spoken to Roger 
Kohn,EPA permit engineer,  about the possibility of not doing the turbine 
installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market 
commitment.  My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the 
EPA issue the station 4 permit.  If we do not initiate any construction 
pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt 
apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued 
about 2 years ago.  In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will 
happern then?  By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be  OK.  
If we decide to do the turbine project  within the period of time that the 
permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.  If not, and a more firm 
decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and 
request termination of the permit.  Usually, the agency places a caveot that 
if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit 
automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions 
of the existing permit for the facility..

Subject: RE: FW: Red Rock Expansion Station 4

John, I agree with your points.  Has EPA already been notified?  If not, we 
should put the proper spin on it, which, in my opinion, should come from 
Marketing.  Something like, "we tried hard, and continue to try hard, to sell 
more capacity, but the market has not cooperated, so we must defer (not 
cancel) the station for now.  We haven't even told FERC yet, so you are the 
first to know."

Jerry

Larry,
(Caveat: The following is just an observation at this point and the view 
expressed is my own).  What concerns me most about this scenario is that we 
pressured the EPA Region IX quite a lot to get this permit and now we are 
just going to let a portion of it go "null and void".  At least, the portion 
applicable to Station 4.  I know we didn't lean on the EPA as hard as we did 
the AZDEQ, but we did repeatedly call them.  Even the FERC Environmental 
Staff was calling Region IX asking when were they going to get the draft out 
- because the FERC was under the assumption that we needed all or none.  

At a time when Enron's veracity has come into question all across America, 
its too bad there isn't a better way to handle this.  Don't be surprised the 
next time you go in asking for expedited treatment on a federal air permit, 
if the regulators look at you with a "question" mark.  I wouldn't say we 
"burned bridges", but we definitely used some "green stamps".  There are only 
so many "green stamps" that we can use with an agency and we used a bundle on 
this one - and now we don't need it.  John

Arnold, I take care of cancelling the air permit for Station 4.  Based upon 
other EPA permits that TW has withdrawn, if the construction activity does 
not take place, the permit by itself becomes null and void.  I have a call 
into the EPA permit engineer to verify this.  Ill let you know......

THIS MAKES IT OFFICIAL..

Larry - It looks like we will not accept the air permit at station 4 and
will withdraw the application.    Is this correct?

Donna - what about FERC?

Subject:  Red Rock Expansion Station 4

This is to confirm our conversation today, the Transwestern Red Rock
expansion currently is scheduled to replace the existing units at Station
1, 2, 3 and 4 with a new unit at each station.  Due to market conditions,
Marketing and Operations have agreed to officially remove Station 4 from
the Red Rock expansion.  We will need to prepare (overhaul) the existing
units at Station 4 to flow the new incremental 120 mmcf/d.
With this information Environmental Affairs can withdrawal the air permit
application for Station 4 and Regulatory Affairs can make necessary
filings.
Thanks for your help.
Dan

I spoke with Debbie Flynn this afternoon to acquire June usage information
for our customers on ELZ.  She said that she has faxed and mailed this
information to you.  Can you please let us know asap if you have that
information?  We only have two days left this month to invoice the

Thanks!

Due to internal issues, the BTU factor, previously reported to the marketers

The correct BTU factor for August 2000 is 1.029.

Any questions may be directed to my attention.

John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why  
Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air 
permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to 
ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information 
required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a 
September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that 
energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I 
phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we 
approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional 
time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else 
could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.

NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY

Submitted Title V Permit Renewal for Mullinville Compressor to the KDHE.

Submittal of standard exemption documention for the NNG Kermit, Plainview, 
Seminole and Brownfield C/S's were submitted to the TNRCC.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY

A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion 
issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which 
are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before 
the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to 
respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of 
the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological 
assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.

A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities 
Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the 
air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a 
normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to 
be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's 
management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.  
On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction 
activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation 
construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant 
underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock 
construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

Larry- Thanks for the update. I am glad that the operating hours in the 
alternative scenario for BOTH STATIONS are agreeable to Transwestern. I will 
be sending the permits to EPA review today with a request for an expedited 
review.

The public notice period starts today, so i trust that the notice signs are 
posted outside your facilities.

Shudeish, the spreadsheets look great.  I spoke to the project engineer
about an hour ago and he told me that we can live with the numbers you have
given us in the permits for Stations 1 and 2 under the alternate operating
scenerio.  He has been in Boliva for the past 2 weeks and was unavailable
for comments.  Please accept my gratitude for all the extra work and effort
you have put in on this issue of operating hour under the alternative
operating scenerio.  We are going to accept the hours as stated in the
permits.  Thanks very much

John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera 
to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug 
Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's 
existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route 
that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then 
heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics 
would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold 
promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas 
of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, 
population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you 
shortly after the trip...

Subject: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes


	

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the "fatal-flaw" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we would need the=

permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September=20
permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy=20

both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule and =

date, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I was=

Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the 
Midland Region.

A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality 
Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.  Transwestern presented letters 
from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the 
AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.  The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate 
the new evidence which had been given to them.  They indicated that they 
would be contacting us after they had reviewed this new data and information.

Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of 
New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise 
inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along 
with them.... 

Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns 
when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to 
an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed 
ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species 
Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing 
happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the 
status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The 
permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air 
group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I 
told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that 
the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken 
care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation 
verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station 
sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the 
Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a 
call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys 
with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as 
to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would 
schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to 
do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping 
authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without 
Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to 
whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo 
Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these 
types of issues. 

Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first 
became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay 
issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from 
the EPA.

Subject: FW: question on Transwestern

Larry -Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting 
a T&E survey at Stations 3 & 4 prior to issuing air permits.  Don't know if 
you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process, but Steve Burns sent 
the following message to me (which I thought I had forwarded to you-sorry 
looks like I didn't).  Any way, I don't know if he could help push the 
process along or not or if the permits he is talking about are ROW only....if 
so, give him a call.

Thanks, Donna.
The reason I ask is that we've been fighting a long political/policy issue 
here in Washington on rights-of-way across federal lands.  
Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications (EBS and fiber optic 
cables).  The agencies we've been pitted against are the BLM and Forest 
Service, and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW 
fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of 
companies.
The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables 
they'll also do to pipelines.  
Two weeks ago, I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this 
issue.  El Paso pipelines told me they've had a tough time getting 
compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion 
into California.
My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the 
Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rights-of-way, and you think you 
might need some help, please feel free to let me know.  We meet regularly 
with Dept of Agriculture senior staff, and should soon meet with the new 
Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth.  We could help if you have any problems.
(Can't help you with the Navajo Nation, though!  But seriously, we'd always 
like to learn if you have problems on Indian lands as well.)

Yes -Stations 2, 3 & 4 are on federal land.  Station 2 is on national forest 
land and Stations 3 & 4 is leased to the Navajo Nation.   Questions, let me

I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to 
submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make 
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held 
this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for 
$120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating 
expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air 
permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns 
brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email 
was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added 
to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the 
draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for 
Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from 
the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of 
this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance 
monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by 
PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last 
several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and 
proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002.

Ill call you today or tomorrow concerning  your possible suggestions and recommendations for dinner, blocking the rooms and the time for the event....the group had originally planned on blocking out 70 rooms.  Enough for the field DES's, safety specialists, env. and safety group in Houston, Danny Pribbles direct reports, Rich Jolly and his advisors, plus guests and speakers.......anyone else?

Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of "fun" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

I think that I might have seen that face somewhere before, in fact that
could be one of our faces.  I found out last week that I didn't get drawn
for the deer/hog hunt that I have gone on the last two years.  Are you going
to take Ryan hunting?  If so when and where.  Right now Daniel is tied up
with being football manager and we don't get to do much.  Thanks for the air
force song that you sent, I got a big kick out of it.  I have been going to
a seminar call "Making your children mind without loosing yours" by a man
named Kevin Leman.  It has been really good and is Biblically based.  He has
a book out by the same name that I would highly recommend.

Later,
Randy

Just to keep all permit information together, I spoke to Roger Kohn and he 
has sent to me the station 3 and 4 air permits.  We are now free to initiate 
construction at these two sites....

Subject: ADEQ permits: public hearing


As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night 
in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had copies 
of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. 
Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as 
Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, 
which is trying to start an air group in Arizona.
I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. 
He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the 
comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments 
postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both 
permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he 
had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. 
Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not 
seem to be any difficulty.
I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when 
the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment 
period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also 
must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it 
was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what 
should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a 
Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than 
the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me.
I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are 
issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving 
quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance 
starts dragging.
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held 
this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 
(86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses 
for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph 
Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their 
system and are presented below:

SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on 
portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these 
portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to 
declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal 
system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the 
fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor 
stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot 
California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, 
it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline 
areas.    

SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss 
the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides 
natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location 
of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.

Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 
interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern 
supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 
2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated 
that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of 
note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side 
of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each 
separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on 
to Transwestern at 86%.

In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for 
the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site 
visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the 
spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance:

Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am

Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am

Jal team  August 8 8:00 am

Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am

I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office 
on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each 
tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and 
assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a 
conflict arises, give me a call at (505) 625-8022.

Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.

I don't have an expense account.  I guess I'll let the money sit until I

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002.

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

Subject: ENSR Cashflow Estimate Through Construction of Project Sundevil


Lady and Gentlemen,

As the Subject line would lead you to believe, I am attaching a further
refinement of our cost estimate, spread out over the life of the project.  I
know that you, Dave, requested a breakdown by personnel and hours, but I am
going to have to go home and pack for my trip.  We certainly can break this
down by personnel and hours, but I cannot do it tonight.  I apologize for
any inconvenience this may cause any of you.  Please remember that you can
contact Jon Alstad in my absence (cc'ed).  I will be back in the office on
October 1st.  Scott

Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the 
MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have 
been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.

A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V 
facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All 
Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.

Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air 
permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an 
endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted 
and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a 
new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered 
Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian 
Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the 
EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.  

Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to 
an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed 
project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.

Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th 
NFL meeting in MIdland.

John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the 
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation 
partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what 
opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that 
will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to 
be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and 
the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress.

Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron 
employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can 
"advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
with the RMEF?

Markets Committee Members:  A meeting of the Working Group of the Markets
Committee has been scheduled for Wednesday, December 13, 2000 from 9:00 a.m.
to 3:00 p.m. at the Holiday Inn in Holyoke, MA.  The meeting's agenda
consists of two items, both of which involve MR 17: (1) Transmission
Congestion Compensation and (2) Structural Screen for OP-4 (bid cap) type of
conditions.

Attached is a file containing two exhibits that provide congestion
information that, hopefully, will aid in the group's discussion on the first
item.  With respect to the second item, we will forward to you any materials
we receive.  If you can not make the meeting in person we have arranged for
a conference call.  The dial-in number is as follows:

Telephone Number:  (212) 293-3100
Passcode:  7837367

Thank you.

Don.

Also, attached is the directions to the ISO which show where the Holyoke
Holiday Inn is located.  As you get off 91 North you will see it on your
left just past the gas station at the corner of Whiting Farms Road and Lower
Holyoke Road.  To your right is Holyoke Mall.  If you should have any
questions, please give Susan Dumond a call at (413) 535-4097.

Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting=
 activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits an=
d has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, t=
he permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this=
 e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is comple=
te, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prio=
r to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on Octob=
er 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  =
The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov=
. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is locat=
ed approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is =
the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have b=
een no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review proc=
ess, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for meas=
uring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fu=
el monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced t=
hem otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur anal=
yzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There wa=
s also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter =
emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer f=
or the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has =
also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  T=
here are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public c=
omment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this dat=
e, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign=
 off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As=
 of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the per=
mits for station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had 
a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.  I 
have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of 
finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.  Take a look at the document and 
let me know what you think.  After your review we can make the necessary 
changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that 
each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a 
separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will 
undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this.

Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is 
because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management. 
They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The 
new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him 
next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New 
Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in 
a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in 
Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and 
regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is 
placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the 
partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the 
Foundations new CEO........

Larry  - Sorry for the delay, but with PRC, life in HR has been pretty
intense.  I also made some initial contacts with the RMEF and have only
managed to play phone tag with the people I really needed to talk to.
Sounds like you've had better luck.

My approach was to look at a way to partner with the RMEF with their land
and habitat conservation programs on a national level rather than focusing
on any particular state.  Hopefully this would encourage broad based Enron
employee support and not foster any state biased partisanship.

Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation contact I tried is:

     Tony Schoonen
     VP Marketing
     Missoula, MT
     406/523-3432

Other Enron Employees I discussed this endeavor with and have indicated
their support are: Ken Crowl (Omaha), Virgil Pfennig (Iowa), & Ty McNeil
(Clifton, KS).

Others that might be interested are: Bob Besecker (Hugoton, KS), Roger Buck
(South Omaha), Andy Gieser (Omaha), Bill Sugg (Glasgow, MT), Ray Knox
(Clifton, KS), Joe Hill (Wolf Point, MT), Ron Omsberg (Mandan, ND), John
Nelson (North Branch, MN), Don Keller (Beatrice, NE), Larry Lottman
(Beatrice, NE), Steve Stedman (Beatrice, NE), Dale Johns (Palmyra, NE),
Kurt Weber (Beatrice, NE), Scott Finkbiner (Glasgow, MT), Bob Hopkins (Wolf
Point, MT), Roger Westfall (Omaha), & Jeff Boyce (Glen Ullin, ND).

All these are from my previous experience in North Operations.  As I
develop relationships as HR Rep for SE Operations, I am sure I will find
more interested employees.

Let me know what you think we should do from here.

Ivan, I had an opportunity to make contact with the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation.  I have contacted the Montana office, which is  the national
headquarters and they have steered me to contacts in New Mexico and
Arizona.  I have met with the New Mexico RMEF contact and he is extremely
interested in GPG involvement and assistance.  I plan on meeting the
Arizona contact in the near future.  If you will steer me on to the states
you and other Enron employees would be interested in providing some
volunteer time and efforts, Id be glad to do the initial RMEF contact for
you.  Let me know at your convenience.....

   Randy, about a month ago, you passed along a name to me of an employee
   that had expressed an interest in developing a partnership with the
   RMEF.  During the conversation with him, he was supposed to check with
   his relatives for a contact name for the RMEF.  I havent heard from him
   since that conversation.  Would you please help me out with his name and
   telephone number.  I want to check with him and see if he is still
   interested.  If not, Im going to pursue a partnership effort  through
   the New Mexico and Arizona chapters of the foundation.

   Thanks for your help.

Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting 
activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and 
has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the 
permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e 
mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, 
but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to 
the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 
and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ 
plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in 
Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 
30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council 
Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no 
responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, 
they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring 
sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel 
monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them 
otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer 
for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also 
an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions 
from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for 
the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also 
approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There 
are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment 
period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it 
will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on 
the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this 
date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for 
station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

Hi Larry,

      We had to change your logon this morning. With the new release of
our software, the "&" does not translate well on your logon.

      Effective 8/30/00 your new logon is:

      PGEES-TE

      The password has been changed to match.

thanks

Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week?

John, I look forward to you being there, hopefully,  for both days.  Your 
presence and participation shows the field teams the environmental commitment 
from Houston. 

Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.  The second 
moring will be devoted to a  "surprise" participation at a local compressor 
station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.  I havent spread this around yet, 
except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but  I plan on dividing the guys into 
groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor 
station.  I plan on setting and hiding  some placebo environmental issues the 
night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other 
housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.  We will then convine 
back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they 
would address the issues identified.  The group that identifies the most 
issues, will get a small gift.  Do I need your approval on the spending of 
some $$$ for a gift?  I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for 
the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they 
want.  The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental 
situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole 
group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams. 
thoughts comments......

Dear Larry,

I have talked to Kent Rylander, our ornithologist, about the bird nest, and
he expressed the opinion that it was either a Swainson's hawk or a
roadrunner.  I have adjusted the report appropriately.  Are there other
issues or does the attached report meet your needs?

Robert

Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool :
South GA. VAldosta
Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool
 will be under a Demand Mismatch Order.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth 
for under deliveries to AGLC's system.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.
If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call 
Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477.

Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in 
fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask 
is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix 
D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other 
compressor station locations and have been approved to use "stain tubes" or 
total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can 
send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help.  
If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below 
referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be 
possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we 
have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us?

Subject: Sulfur Content Test Method



Larry,

I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31,
which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing
everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the
comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer.
Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I
would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP,
there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in
Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know
some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks.

2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual
sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the
sulfur
content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, "Standard Test Method for Total
Sulfur in Fuel Gases", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) "Standard
Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and
Radiometric Colorimetry," ASTM D5504-94 "Standard Test Method for
Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by
Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence," or ASTM D3246-81
(Reapproved 1987) "Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By
Oxidative Microcoulometry" (incorporated by reference under
o  75.6).

Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the 
time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and 
Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the 
permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will 
do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to 
initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an 
expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.

Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.

Transwestern Pipeline Company

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.

John, in response to you questions below, im da man.  Ill call you today or 
tomorrow concerning  your possible suggestions and recommendations for 
dinner, blocking the rooms and the time for the event....the group had 
originally planned on blocking out 70 rooms.  Enough for the field DES's, 
safety specialists, env. and safety group in Houston, Danny Pribbles direct 
reports, Rich Jolly and his advisors, plus guests and speakers.......anyone 
else?

Subject: RE: Draft, Flagstaff Spring meeting


Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of "fun" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

Demand charge for July:  .60

The swing rate will be on the July invoice which is scheduled to go out,
along
with June, in about 2 weeks.
May's invoice should go out next week.

Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits 
which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.

Subject: NYISO Newsflash: External load a good deal



All,
?
You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting 
that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO 
LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the 
impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices 
there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In 
this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid 
$1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound 
congestion).
?
As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be 
expected to be less  negative.
?
Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, 
when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the 
difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered.
?
NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today.
?
Scott

John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA=
=20
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours=
=20
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation=
=20
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that=
=20
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that=
=20
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t=
he=20
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need=
=20
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon=
g=20
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin=
g=20
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th=
e=20
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro=
l=20
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know=
=20
time is of the essence.

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=
=20
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr=
=20
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=
vd=20
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, =
at=20
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are=
=20
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we=
=20
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we=
=20
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented=
=20
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads=
=20
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with=
=20
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou=
ld=20
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

Subject: Con Edison's Capacity Release/Delivery Service Programs for the 2=
=20
000/2001 Winter Season



As a result of feedback received at the July 6 reliability collaborative,
Con Edison has made the following changes to its capacity release/delivery
service programs for the 2000/2001 winter season.

First, to assist you in meeting your primary point obligations relating to
the firm load on our system that you are serving, Con Edison will make
available to Marketers 25,000 dt/day on Transco.  Your allocation based on
active customers in your group as of July 1, 2000 is
511 dt/day in the form of either:

  (a) a capacity release of Transco capacity at the
Transco maximum
   rate for the 12-month period November 2000 through
October 2001,
   or

  (b) a bundled citygate sale for November 2000 through
March 2001 priced
   as follows:

*  Inside F.E.R.C.=01,s first of the month index price at
    Transco/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt.

 or;

  (c) a combination of the two adding up to 511 dt per
day.


Second, in addition to the above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day
during March 2001 as a bundled citygate sale on the same terms as set forth
above.

Third, with respect to the balance of capacity that you may require to meet
your primary point obligations,

  (a) There will be no citygate allocation requirements
for this winter, except for the 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you
may deliver     all of your gas to any of the
following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to
Texas Eastern.

       Transco (Receipt
Point: 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach)

       Tennessee (Receipt
Point:  White Plains)

  (b) We will permit you to meet the primary point
requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load
Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service)
during November instead of the Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during
the remaining four winter months.

  (c) Prior to the winter, you can trade all or part of
your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to another marketer, so long as
the aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all
marketers remains below 25% of the combined total allocation.

Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, July 28, 2000
which, if any, of the above-described services you are interested in.

NOTES:
1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a
result of actions taken by other marketers.
2. Bundled sales service is subject to the execution of a written
agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment
and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.

I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter 
that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting 
Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been 
indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue 
at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a 
couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to 
discuss the issue with Arco.
I will keep everyone apprised on the progress.
