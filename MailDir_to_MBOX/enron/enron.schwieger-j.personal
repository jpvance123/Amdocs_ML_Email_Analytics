Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

Hey Jim,

How's it going?  It's that time of year again.  Please don't forget me should 
you have any leftover rodeo tickets.  I will be forever greatful as with all 
the other times.  I see one that I am particularly interested in (Def 
Leppard).  I'd like to get four for that one if you happen to come across 
any.  Sorry to be such a bug already.  I feel bad asking since I'm not part 
of the group anymore.  Well, let me know if you should have any leftovers 
that you just can't seem to get rid of at the last minute.  Thanks bud!  
Sorry to write only when I want something.

-Brenda

John:

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss=

f the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution=
.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t=
ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str=
uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations =
of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o=
f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr=
on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde=
d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h=
ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa=
irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan=
 so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s=
olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny =
an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un=
der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of =
the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!

For 50 years, the Harvard Law School Forum has been sponsoring speeches by
luminaries ranging from Fidel Castro to Gerald Ford to Dr. Ruth. Sometimes
the speeches have generated a bit of media coverage, sometimes not. But one
given last month by Charlton Heston has taken on a life of its own. Heston,
the actor and conservative activist, delivered a stem-winder to about 200
listeners about "a cultural war that's about to hijack your birthright to
think and say what resides in your heart." 

 

"He knew he was coming to a liberal environment, and clearly a group of his
listeners was conservative and another was more liberal," said David
Christopherson, president of the forum. "About half respectfully challenged
him during the questions. It generated a lot of debate around the campus.
But what happened caught us off-guard." What happened was Rush Limbaugh's
radio talk show. On March 15, Limbaugh read the entire speech on the air,
only to find himself bombarded with thousands of requests for a copy of it.
The same thing happened at Harvard Law. "We couldn't keep up with all the
requests," said Mike Chmura at Harvard. "It really didn't have legs and
might have been forgotten if Mr. Limbaugh hadn't decided to deliver it."


 

 

 

'Winning the Cultural War' Charlton Heston's Speech to the Harvard Law
School Forum, Feb 16, 1999: 

 

I remember my son when he was five, explaining to his kindergarten class
what his father did for a living. "My Daddy," he said, "pretends to be
people." There have been quite a few of them. Prophets from the Old and New
Testaments, a couple of Christian saints, generals of various nationalities
and different centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. 

 

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my Creator gave me the gift
to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men, then I want to
use that same gift now to reconnect you with your own sense of liberty of
your own freedom of thought ... your own compass for what is right. 

 

Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, "We
are now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure." Those words are true
again. I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war, a cultural
war that's about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in
your heart. I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty
inside you...the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the
miracle that it is. 

 

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle
Association, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. I ran for
office, I was elected, and now I serve...I serve as a moving target for the
media who've called me everything from "ridiculous" and "duped" to a
rain-injured, senile, crazy old man." I know...I'm pretty old...but I sure,
Lord, ain't senile. 

 

As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment
freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much,
much bigger than that.  I've come to understand that a cultural war is
raging across our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated. 

 

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 - long before
Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an audience last year that
white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone else's
pride, they called me a racist. I've worked with brilliantly talented
homosexuals all my life. But when I told an audience that gay rights should
extend no further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe. 

 

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a speech, when
I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out
innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite. Everyone I know knows I
would never raise a closed fist against my country. But when I asked an
audience to oppose this cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy
McVeigh. 

 

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially saying,
"Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are using language not authorized
for public consumption!" But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in
political correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to
the British crown. 

 

In his book, "The End of Sanity," Martin Gross writes that "blatantly
irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every
area of human endeavor. There seem to be new customs, new rules, new
anti-intellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction.
Underneath, the nation is broiling. Americans know something without a name
is undermining the nation, turning the mind mushy when it comes to
separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong. And they don't like
it." 

 

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men seeking
intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step of the process
from kissing to petting to final copulation ... all clearly spelled out in a
printed college directive. 

 

In New Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had been
infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the state commissioner
announced that health providers who are HIV-positive need not ..... need not
.. ... tell their patients that they are infected. 

 

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the school team
"The Tribe" because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians, only to
learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name. 

 

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights of
transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for transsexuals to have
separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery. 

 

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been placed in
bilingual classes to learn their three R's in Spanish solely because their
last names sound Hispanic. 

 

At the University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died at
Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college officially set up
segregated dormitory space for black students. Yeah, I know that's out of
bounds now. 

 

Dr. King said "Negroes." Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said
"black." But it's a no-no now. For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ...
particularly "Native-American." I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I
also happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On my
wife's side, my grandson is a thirteenth generation Native American ... with
a capital letter on "American." 

 

Finally, just last month ... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C.
Office of Public Advocate, used the word "niggardly" while talking to
colleagues about budgetary matters. Of course, "niggardly" means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign.
As columnist Tony Snow wrote: "David Howard got fired because some people in
public employ were morons who  (a) didn't know the meaning of niggardly, (b)
didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning, and (c)
actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance." 

 

What does all of this mean? It means that telling us what to think has
evolved into telling us what to say, so telling us what to do can't be far
behind. Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses? And why do you
continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed to debate ideas,
surrender to their suppression? 

 

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they really
believe? It scares me to death, and should scare you too, that the
superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason. You are the
best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle of American
academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles River, you are the
cream. But I submit that you, and your counterparts across the land, are the
most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord
Bridge. And as long as you validate that...and abide it ... you are by your
grandfathers' standards cowards. 

 

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major university, Second
Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their
findings or they'll lose their jobs. Why? Because their research findings
would undermine big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seeks to extort
hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers. I don't care
what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked at that, am shocked at
you. Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who
will defend the core value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free
thought and expression lay down your arms and plead, "Don't shoot me." 

 

If you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you see
distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a sexist. If you
think critically about a denomination, it does not make you anti-religion.
If you accept but don't celebrate homosexuality, it does not make you a
homophobe. Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. 

 

But what can you do? How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social
subjugation? The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, standing with Dr.
Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand people. You simply ... disobey.
Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of course. Nonviolently, absolutely. 

 

But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave, we don't. We
disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom. I
learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who learned it
from Gandhi, and Thoreau, and Jesus, and every other great man who led those
in the right against those with the might.

 

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that disobedient
spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor that sent Thoreau to jail, that
refused to sit in the back of the bus, that protested a war in Viet Nam. In
that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with
massive disobedience of rogue authority, social directives and onerous laws
that weaken personal freedom. But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience
demands that you put yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies.
You must be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water cannons at Selma. You must be
willing to experience discomfort. I'm not complaining, but my own decades of
social activism have taken their toll on me. 

 

Let me tell you a story. A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T
who was selling a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and murdering
police officers. It was being marketed by none other than Time/Warner, the
biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world. Police across the country
were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one had been murdered. But Time/Warner
was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media were
tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black. I heard Time/Warner had a
stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills. I owned some shares at the
time, so I decided to attend. What I did there was against the advice of my
family and colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a thousand
average American stockholders, I simply read the full lyrics of "Cop
Killer"- every vicious, vulgar, instructional word. 

 

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF. I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF. I'M 

ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF. I'M ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..." 

 

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But trust me,
the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched faces. The Time/Warner
executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes. They hated me
for that. Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old nieces of Al
and Tipper Gore. 

 

"SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...." 

 

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I left the
room in echoing silence. When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps,
one of them said "We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but
Time/Warner's selling it." Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's
contract. I'll never be offered another film by Warner's, or get a good
review from Time magazine.  But disobedience means you must be willing to
act, not just talk.

 

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam the
switchboard of the district attorney's office. 

 

When your university is pressured to lower standards until 80% of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of regents. 

 

When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the playground and gets
hauled into court for sexual harassment march on that school and block its
doorways. 

 

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you...
petition them, oust them, banish them. 

 

When Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott their magazine
and the products it advertises. 

 

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the hallowed
footsteps of the great disobedience's of history that freed exiles, founded
religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the hands of an aroused rabble in
arms and a few great men, by God's grace, built this country.  If Dr. King
were here, I think he would agree.

Hi Jim. Here are some picture of the Daytona and the Daytona 2.  Also here
is a picture of a new Gauntlet legends game that I think your kids would
really enjoy.  It's a 4-player showcase cabinet that looks great.  We have
them at a special price of 2195.00 They were over 3500 when they first came
out.  I am assuming you want them all set on "free play".  You can email me
back.

Thanks,

Lutz

 and might call the police before he reached the teller window.  So he left
 the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. After waiting a
 few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller.  He read
 it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn't the brightest
 light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his stickup note
 because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would
 either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of
 America.  Looking somewhat defeated, the man said "OK" and left.  He was
 arrested a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of

 said, "Because I don't believe you are over 21." The robber said he was, but
 the clerk still refused to give it to him because he didn't believe him.  At
 this point the robber took his driver's license out of his wallet and gave
 it to the clerk.  The clerk looked it over, and agreed that the man was in
 fact over 21 and he put the scotch in the bag.  The robber then ran from the
 store with his loot.  The cashier promptly called the police and gave the

For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit th=
at I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a=
nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem=
ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el=
se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior=
 Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati=
on the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such a=
s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten=
ded to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these v=
alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som=
ething just the opposite.

I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n=
ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha=
ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in=
 the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t=
he statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue"  implies to me that this ind=
ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa=
inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga=
me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen=
t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua=
ting values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn=
ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini=
tion of the word "HEDGE".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an=
d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski=
ng customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure En=
ron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?

I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i=
n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse=
d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I=
 will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the=
 Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say=
 " do as I say not as I do"? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se=
nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as =
their word?

The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t=
ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and =
took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin=
ion is "CRIMINAL".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp=
etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals=
 have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne=
ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h=
aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders =
have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we=
re hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther =
down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve=
d and to institute criminal charges.  =20

I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not =
think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we=
 trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a th=
orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what=
 actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor=
mance to date.=20

I checked this out. It's not a virus and is OK to run.

I thought this was the funniest election joke yet.

Coaches,


I still need to get volunteer information from most of you.   As the
Commissioner for Bleyl and Hancock I am responsible for getting the
volunteer information turned in ASAP from each coach.  Pleas get this
information to me quickly since time is already running short. Thanks.

Louis Martinez

Hi everyone,

Well I have volunteered to schedule all the volunteers for the NIT
tournament. I drafted Ashley Wagner to help with this task.  I need all the
School Commissioners to contact your coaches and ask them to email me their
3 volunteers asap.  If they do not have email access would you please get
the names and email them to me? Those of you who have the names and have
just been waiting to find out what to do with them, now can unload them on
me.

Ashley Wagner and myself will start calling them (so please include a phone
number!) to see when they would like to work.  The first names we get will
be the first we call so they will get the best choice of fields and times.
So do them a favor and get them in soon!!!

Thanks for your help on this.

space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.

Thanks a lot. It is difficult to find a better example example of commitment 
to Enron and to professional excellence

The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.  
Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization 
that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group 
comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from 
Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job 
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The 
greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.  
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were 
moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve 
an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would 
stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our 
success.

 Thanks,  Jim Schwieger

This article was written by Tamim Ansary, an Afghani-American writer. 
Here is his take on Afghanistan and the mess we are in.
Please read it to the end.  The last paragraphs are the most important. 



I've been hearing a lot of talk about "bombing Afghanistan back to the
Stone Age." Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, conceded that this would
mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this
atrocity.  "But we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What else
can we do?" Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether or not 
"we have the belly to do what must be done."  

I have thought especially hard about the issues being raised because 
I am from Afghanistan.  And even though I've lived here for 35 years, 
I've never lost track of what's going on there. 

So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm
standing.  

I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. 
There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the
atrocity
in New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters. 
But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. 
They're not even the government of Afghanistan. 

The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in
1997. 
Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan. 
When you think Taliban, think Nazis. 
When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. 
And when you think "the people of Afghanistan" think "the Jews in the
concentration camps." 

It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity. 
They were also the first victims of the perpetrators. 
They would rejoice if someone would come in, take out the Taliban, 
and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their
country.  

Some say, "why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban?" 
The answer is: they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering.  
A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000 
disabled orphans in Afghanistan -- a country with no economy, no food.  
There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has been burying these widows
alive 
in mass graves. The soil is littered with land mines, and the farms were all
destroyed by the Soviets. 
This is why the people of Afghan have not overthrown the Taliban.  

We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age.  
Trouble is, that's already been done. 
The Soviets took care of that already.  
Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. 
Level their houses? Done.  
Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done. 
Eradicate their hospitals? Done. 
Destroy their infrastructure? 
Cut them off from medicine and health care? 
Too late.
The Russians already did all that. 
New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. 
Would the bombs at least get the Taliban? Not likely. 
In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban eat, only they have the means to
move around.
They would slip away and hide. 
Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans ... they don't move
too fast.  
They don't even have wheelchairs. 
Flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't be a strike against the
criminals who did this horrific thing. 
Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban -- by raping
once again 
the people they've been raping all this time.  

So what else is there? What can be done? 

Let me now speak with true fear and trembling. 
The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops. 
When people speak of "having the belly to do what needs to be done," 
they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many people as
needed ... 
having the belly to overcome the moral qualms of killing innocent people. 
Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's actually on the table is
Americans dying. 
And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through
Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout.  

It's much bigger than that folks.  Because to get any troops to Afghanistan,

we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. 
The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. 
Will other Muslim nations just stand by? 

You see where I'm going? 

We're flirting with a world war between Islam and the West.

And guess what: 
THAT IS BIN LADEN'S PROGRAM!.  
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS!
THAT IS WHY HE DID THIS! 

Read his speeches and statements.  It's all right there. 
He really believes Islam would beat the west. 

It might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into 
Islam vs. the West, then he has a billion soldiers. 
If the west wreaks a holocaust on those lands, then that's a billion
people with nothing left to lose ... and that's even better from Bin Laden's
point
of view. 

He's probably wrong.  In the end the west would probably win.  Whatever that
would mean. 

But the war would last for years, and millions would die, not just theirs
but ours. 

Who has the belly for that? 

Bin Laden does.  

Anyone else?

Good Morning!
Hope your teeth aren't too sore today.  :)

Mark and I talked about when to come to Houston.

The ideal would be for the 3 of us (Mark, Linda, Anna) to fly down late
morning on Sat. the 30th.  Ben would need a late afternoon flight on Monday
July 2nd,(he is suppose to pull in from the bus at noon, so late afternoon
would give him some buffer time).  All 4 of us could fly back on Sunday July
8th, late morning or what ever is available.  We are flexible.

Thanks a bunch!!!!
We are looking forward to a great visit.

Love and Hugs,
Linda

Hi Jim,

The dimensions for the game are 68lx81Hx75.5w The Daytona twin is $4,999 for
both units and 4295 for the Daytona 2 single seat. I originally quoted you
44-4500 for the Daytona and was reading off the wrong line, I apologize for
that.  To ship the Galaga/Ms Pacman is 275 to your door.  Keep in mind that
the units breakdown and should fit through a 34 - 36 door.

Thanks,

Lutz

This picture is supposedly from a camera found in the wreckage of the WTC, 
developed by the FBI for evidence and released on the net today.
The guy still has no name and is missing.

You have to listen to this one very funny -- It's clean (no really it is)
For those of you who are using 1972 computers and don't have speakers

Gentlemen,

Please take a moment to review the attached document that has been sent in
to the coordinator of the CFSA Tournament volunteers.  As you will see we
are still in need of a volunteer list from most of you.  For those of you
who have turned in your list, thank you very much, your prompt attention to
this request is greatly appreciated. I know Spring Break did not help
matters much but I need to get a completed list turned in ASAP. The longer
you wait the less of a chance you will have of getting your choice.
Remember CFSA is operated on a volunteer basis.  This means the organization
will only be as good as the people that volunteer.

Hey gang, just wanted to drop everyone a note and wish you a happy memorial day - summer is here and Grenada is
just around the corner.  I suggest we all try to pick a day in June to get together.  We need to decide if we want to
sign up for a tour with Mandoo and on what day (not you Jim since you are coming in Saturday night!).

Anyway, email me back and let me know what day would be good for you for happy hour and if you want to sign up
for a tour on Friday or Saturday in Grenada or just wing it on our own!

Later,
Kim

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim

> Our new affiliation with USSSA also offers post season play with a tiered

> POST SEASON PONY BASEBALL
> *	Divisions/Teams/Players that CFSA registered with Pony and that are
> eligible to participate
> 		Bronco Maroon Division
> 		CFSA Bronco Co-Op Teams
> 		Triple A 12 & 11 year old Division
> 		Pony Maroon Division
> 		CFSA Pony Co-Op Teams
> 		Pre-High Division
> *	All-Star teams selected from league players using CFSA guidelines
> *	Maroon, Co-Op, and Triple A Teams were registered by CFSA and
> eligible
> *	Graduated advancement to higher levels of competition; District,
> Section, Regional, State, Zone, Nationals on a weekly basis (Similar to
> Little League)
> *	One entry fee covers all events your team advances to
> *	Typically only one or two teams form per division
> *	Tournament Divisions:
> *		Bronco 11 (Local -2 level Tournament)
> *		Bronco 11 & 12 (National Tournament)
> *		Pony 13 (Statewide)
> *		Pony 13 & 14 (National)
> Teams my play in tact with their roster or may form an All-Star Team.
> Applications for All-Star coaching positions are available on our web
> site. Complete the application and provide it to the Upper Division
> Baseball Commissioner.
> CFSA Triple A and Sunday Co-op Teams are automatically qualified for Pony
> tournaments. These teams must submit a roster by 2/24/01 that will remain
> frozen (for Pony purposes) until all division All-Star teams have been
> chosen. These teams may also play in the division Round Robin, but will
> not participate for seeding, nor are their players at risk in the draft.

> advance to the World Series)
> CFSA/USSSA Post Season
> *	Double A: This level of competition is for teams who participate in
> the CFSA league and who are not on a Triple A League team. A player may be
> on a Sunday Co-op team and still be eligible to play on a Double A
> tournament team. USSSA will allow 1 berth to the State tournament for

After more years than I care to mention, I am leaving Enron tomorrow as part of the team that's going to AEP with the sale of Houston Pipe Line Company.

I just wanted to say thanks to as many people as I could remember that helped make the time at Enron pass so quickly.  It's been great working with you!!

Best wishes

Lee

    I thought all you non-Floridians might like to see the new crop
    of bumper stickers floating around Florida these days ...
    from those who put the "DUH" in "Floriduh"!


    FLORIDA: If you think we can't vote, wait till you see us drive.

    FLORIDA: We count more than you do.

    FLORIDA: If you don't like the way we count then take I-95 and
    visit one of  the other 56 states.

    FLORIDA: We've been Gored by the bull of politics and we're
    Bushed.

    FLORIDA: Relax, Retire, Revote.

    FLORIDA: Where your vote counts and counts and counts.

    FLORIDA: This is what you get for taking Elian away from us!

    FLORIDA: We're number one! Wait! Recount!

    Palm Beach County:  If you're nice, we'll let you vote twice.

    Palm Beach County: We put the "duh" in Florida.

    Sign on I-95 : Florida this way 2 miles , no, that way  5 miles,
    no, wait 10...

    Pro-electorate's choice: Abort the pregnant chads.

    We, the people,  have spoken. Now shut up and listen while the
         lawyers tell us what we said.

    FLORIDA: We can't vote, but you should see us handle 15 bingo
    cards!

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, "We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?"  
"Sure," said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, "Now go out and play."  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What religion do you think we are?"  
The oldest one said, "We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you."  
The littlest one said, "Didn't you smell that water?"  
"Yes. What do you think that means?"  
"That means we're Pisscopalians"

Called the number you gave me about 7:40 PM but it was your pager not your cell phone. (713-415-4571)
I figured you were pretty tired and just sleeping, which was the best thing for you anyway.
I went over to the Kinder Morgan party.  

You missed a great weekend.
Saturday was a little cool up at the lake, but Sunday was fantastic.

I hope you feel better before your trip to the spa.
Don't work so much!

Here is an update of the playoff  schedule.  In the Gray Consolation round we will take the games as we can  get them played.  A huge number of school activity conflicts is making it  difficult for the teams to play an orderly bracket by dates.  We will  finish when we finish and I will update the information as I go.
 
An All Star will be coached by the 1st  place Maroon coach's team the Labay Braves.  His name is Brent Mann and  more information about try outs and schedule will be coming.  Next e-mail  will have the equipment turn in time.  Thanks,  Fred

Coaches,

As you can see we are still in need of the volunteers for this years
tournament.  Please respond to me ASAP with the three names choices of your
volunteers.  Thanks,

Louis Martinez


Hi everyone,

Well I have volunteered to schedule all the volunteers for the NIT
tournament. I drafted Ashley Wagner to help with this task.  I need all the
School Commissioners to contact your coaches and ask them to email me their
3 volunteers asap.  If they do not have email access would you please get
the names and email them to me? Those of you who have the names and have
just been waiting to find out what to do with them, now can unload them on
me.

Ashley Wagner and myself will start calling them (so please include a phone
number!) to see when they would like to work.  The first names we get will
be the first we call so they will get the best choice of fields and times.
So do them a favor and get them in soon!!!

Thanks for your help on this.

Hi Jim,
Here's another thought on games.  If you get our Ultracade system you'll get
24 games installed and a new cabinet for 3599.99.  Any word on the Galaga or
Daytona?  Here's a link to it:
http://www.arcadeequipmentwarehouse.com/Ultracade/ultracade.html also look
through our used video list, it hasn't been updated recently but most of
what's on there is still available.  It shows we have 3 sets of Daytona's
available but we only have one and one Daytona 2 set.  Also we currently
have 2 of the Galaga/Pacman games in stock.
Let me know,
Lutz

Jim,
David and I wanted to let you know that Phillip has broken his arm over the
weekend and he will be out of sports for a while.  He has an appt with an
orthopedic surgeon on Friday and we should know more after that with regards 
to
exactly how long he has to be in a cast.  Needless to say, Phillip is very
disappointed.  We will keep you posted.

Thanks,
David and Carolyn Warnick

OK Coaches and other concerned  people,
 
Here is the latest update on  reschedules.  But first, I apologize for trying to reschedule 4 games at  one field on one night.  This is the correction of that mess and most of  the other messes in the reschedule.  There are two games on the list that  have not been rescheduled yet but they are on the list to let you know that I  know that it needs to be done.
 
Now, what I need from you is scores that  have not been called in and I need future scores called in on time.  It's  getting late in the season I need information on a timely basis.  I don't  want to enforce the 24 hour rule, but some of you are waiting a week or  more.  After tomorrow, if you wait a week or more to call in a score you  will forfeit the game.  Please help me get this stuff done on time as we  come to the close of the season.  I am working hard to make it so we can  end on time, but I can't do it without some help.  Currently I am missing  scores for games 1212, 1229, 1235, 1236, 1237, 1238 and from teh Gray Div. 1067,  1070, 1100, 1136, 1141.  Thanks.

Per your conversation with Pat Dowd, please find attached two versions of the 
performance figures for your accounts.  We ran the return numbers two ways; 
Sheet 1 was calculated by subracting the ending balance from the beginning 
balance, (less deposits and withdrawals) then divided by the beginning 
balance.  Sheet 2 was calculated by dividing the earnings by the total 
investment.  You'll also find the historical performance of the indices that 
you requested at the end of each sheet.

Feel free to modify the sheets to fit your needs - let us know if you require 
any further information.  I will forward you the physical backup (statements, 
etc) to follow.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame 
or "cover our backsides";  however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine 
breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the 
desk.  As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white 
issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executives 
of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to 
ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.  
Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this 
divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into 
the overall framework of ENA.

I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading 
floor.

I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas 
business.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Bammel Storage Cushion Gas Issue.

I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the 
HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated 
to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas 
that would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to set 
the record straight in the spirit of "Facts Are Friendly".  

First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six - 
eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of 
Wes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year 
end to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not a 
problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just 
the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:  
1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.  
2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31, 
2000. 
 1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF 
was made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based on
         the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several 
years proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice, 
the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period the 
Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the 
physical           capabilities of the facility.  
 2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with 
anything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included 
the         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.  
This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.  
In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left 
in the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it 
could be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.
It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up 
irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I was 
dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level 
involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.  

>From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if 
I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the 
cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated 
to and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with other 
issues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring 
around to cover their backside.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

We just got some more information in the mail yesterday on the College
Savings Plan.  We will study it some more, and let you know how good or bad
it sounds.  Some good may be that YOU could deduct the amount you give on
YOUR income tax (there doesn't seem to be a cap on deducting the amount you
give if you make big bucks).  The initial bad I see is the $24/year fee plus
.6% of earnings.  Anyway, we will look it over in more detail.  They do not
restrict you to only go to Nebraska colleges, and you do not have to be a
Nebraska resident to open up an account.   Josh and Jarrod could each have
an account, with annual contributions up to $165,000 (tax deferred), and
when you take the money out, it is taxed at Josh and Jarrods tax rate.

Please remind me/reassure me about the Educational IRA.  It is similar to a
Roth IRA in that taxes are paid (by you in this case)on the money prior to
putting it into the account.  I don't list it anywhere on my income tax
forms until we start taking the money out.  In essence it is as if we are
putting $500 of our own money (taxes already paid) into the account, right?

There is no school again today.  Ice on the roads and more ice and snow to
come later today. I think this is the 5th or 6th day they have missed.  They
have to make it up at the end of the school year.

Mom said your house on the lake is all done being remodeled.  Bet it looks
nice.

Have a great day!

Love,
Linda

Linda and Mark:
I would like you guys to decide what to do and let me know.  Ben and Anna
will more than likely go to Nebraska so it make sense.  We still have to
make the 2001 contribution so if you want me to send it to the Nebraska
fund let me know.

Jim,

This was just passed by the Nebraska legislature, and thought it might be a
better plan than the educational IRA.

Let us know what you think.

Love and Hugs,
Linda

P.S. I worked on the Ameritrade "stuff" (Schedule D) some more.  Hopefully
I
plugged in the right #'s.  I might mail a copy to you just to be sure.  Too
bad we don't have a scanner here at home.

Hello Jim,

I work for Jeanie as a generalist.  She asked me to gather some information for you on your retirement options.  Here is some general information that you will need to know about when considering retirement:

Also, if you want more information on your Medical Coverage Plan Options please contact Tony Jarrett at x37829.

Jim,
I got a notice from the dentist yesterday that Jarrod has a dental cleaning 
scheduled for February 28 at 4:30.  I have a doctors appointment that day at 
3:30 and cannot take him - can you?  If not, let me know and I'll reschedule 
his appointment.

Also, I am scheduled to have the boys the weekend of April 21-22, and would 
like to switch with you if possible.  Let me know what would work for you.  
Thanks,
Joan

Coaches,


I still need to get volunteer information from most of you.   As the
Commissioner for Bleyl and Hancock I am responsible for getting the
volunteer information turned in ASAP from each coach.  Pleas get this
information to me quickly since time is already running short. Thanks.

Louis Martinez

Hi everyone,

Well I have volunteered to schedule all the volunteers for the NIT
tournament. I drafted Ashley Wagner to help with this task.  I need all the
School Commissioners to contact your coaches and ask them to email me their
3 volunteers asap.  If they do not have email access would you please get
the names and email them to me? Those of you who have the names and have
just been waiting to find out what to do with them, now can unload them on
me.

Ashley Wagner and myself will start calling them (so please include a phone
number!) to see when they would like to work.  The first names we get will
be the first we call so they will get the best choice of fields and times.
So do them a favor and get them in soon!!!

Thanks for your help on this.

cannot be transferred until the previous balance is paid in full.

Q. I=01,m not currently a Road Runner customer. What is the process?

A. Your address will be checked to verify Road Runner serviceability. If=20

Q. Are there any installation charges?

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?	A "How to Exercise Options" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Please take time to review this material.  It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative.

>From the comments I've heard no one is trying to make you the scape goat.  If 
your feeling victimized by someone, give me a call and lets talk about it.  
There was a breakdown in communication between the deal team, trading and 
accounting on this issue.  Its not a good thing that it happened, and now we 
have to deal with it. 

The bottom line is that the PRM unwind cost is $203 cost plus the 5.5 bcf 
re-injection cost (based on the fact that we have been representing 65.5 bcf 
of pad gas since we began the process).   As you mention in your note, your 
use of 5.5 bcf of pad gas over the past years is independent of the balance 
sheet, and has been a great way to optimize the Bammel asset. 

Since we didn't adjust the pad gas volume we represented on the balance 
sheet, we are obligated to deliver 65.5 bcf and therefore must include a 5.5 
bcf re-injection assumption as part of the unwind cost.   What we need to do 
know is decide the best way to hedge this obligation, given the forward price 
curve and the uncertainty as to when Closing will occur.

Regards,
Brian

Subject: Bammel Storage Cushion Gas Issue.

I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the 
HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated 
to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas 
that would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to set 
the record straight in the spirit of "Facts Are Friendly".  

First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six - 
eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of 
Wes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year 
end to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not a 
problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just 
the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:  
1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.  
2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31, 
2000. 
 1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF 
was made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based on
         the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several 
years proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice, 
the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period the 
Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the 
physical           capabilities of the facility.  
 2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with 
anything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included 
the         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.  
This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.  
In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left 
in the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it 
could be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.
It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up 
irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I was 
dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level 
involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.  

>From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if 
I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the 
cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated 
to and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with other 
issues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring 
around to cover their backside.

Welcome Back!
Mom said you weren't feeling so great all week because of your sinus
problems and a sore throat.  NO FUN!!  Hope you're better now.  If you are
at work today, you are probably swamped with things to catch up on.

You make it pretty hard to give you a thank-you.  I write you an e-mail
thanking you for great stuff you've done, and you come back with more stuff
to give us.  :)

Coming to Houston for the 4th of July sounds good to us.  WE APPRECIATE THE
OFFER TO PAY FOR AIRFARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We had been thinking of
renting a van to drive the whole way.

The tricky thing again this year is figuring out how to get Ben there.  He
has another church event the week of June 25th-July 2nd.  We thought about
having him ride back on the bus to Omaha (so he doesn't miss out on the fun
stuff they do on the way back), arriving Monday the 2nd around noon, and
then we all fly out together on the afternoon of the 2nd or... Mark Anna and
I leave on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th, and have Marlyss and Gary
help Ben catch a flight Monday the 2nd or Tuesday the 3rd.  Mark should be
able to take the whole week off.

The other tricky thing in the whole deal has to do with whether Ben will
have to take summer school.  He has been told that if he flunks a class this
semester, he will have to retake it in summer school.  We won't know for
sure if he is going to flunk until the middle or end of May.  If he has to
take summer school, he will not go on the church event or come to Houston
with us because summer school is only offered the first part of June through
July 13th.  If reservations are made for Ben, we would not be able to use
it.  Let me know your thoughts.

I did look up information again about the educational IRA.  According to
page 27 of the 1040 instruction book, you cannot deduct contributions to an
educational IRA (just like you cannot deduct contributions to a Roth).

Mark and I haven't decided anything about the NE fund.

You probably realize this but the kids educational IRA's are not doing well.
Your $1,000 contribution is now down to $843.  I know you say for the long
run we shouldn't worry, but since Ben will graduate in 3 years, I'm
wondering if it is still the best place to be.  Let me know what you think.

Love and Hugs,
Linda

Linda:

Thanks for the note!
have you guys decided about the Nebr. Fund!
Your one previous "e" mail about the Education IRA bothers me.  Im not sure
if I replied to you or not, but you and Mark should be deducting the $1,000
( $500 for Ben & $500 for Anna) on your tax return.  Im not positive about
the deduction but there is something you need to fill out Im sure.  I can
not make the contribution myself because my income is over the limit
allowed.  That is why I deposit cash so it looks like you and Mark have
done it!  If you get a chance look into this for me for your 2000 taxes.

Don't worry about $$$$$$.  Like I told Mom money is not something the
Schieger Family should have to worry about for a long time.  The FORCE has
been good.
You just need to communicate with me!

The boys and I are leaving for Colorado to go skiing this Friday.  We will
be there until Saturday March 17.   Brent & Chad Daniel are going with us
so Josh & Jarrod will have company and I can relax.

I would like you & Mark to start thinking about the fourth of July this
year.  I thought it would be nice to give Donna a break and have everyone
down here this July.
I realize the fourth is on a Wednesday which might take some maneuvering
for Mark.  One idea is to take the whole week off as vacation and you guys
could stay at the lake house the whole week.  It would be like Minnesota
just alot warmer.  There would be a ski boat, two wave runners, fishing
etc.  If you are interested let me know as soon as possible.  I will pay
for the airfare for the four of you so the sooner you decide the more time
the travel agent has to find good deals.

Ya quite bitching about me paying for the airfare.  Get over it!

     Love Ya,   Swig

Just wanted to say thanks for all you do for us.  I think about it a lot, I
just don't tell you enough.

I really appreciate our van, knowing we paid so little for it.

I am very thankful for our windows, siding and roof, and knowing what a
deal
you have given us makes it even better.

It is comforting to know we will have some money for the kids education.

Etc. Etc. Etc.

Linda

Hi Jim,

The shipping quote to your door is 269.00/game. There was know price break
on two or more because they had to be but on individual pallets.  Here are
some pictures of what I have available in the classic games. I almost forgot
to tell you.  We have a brand new gauntlet Legends 4 player in a dedicated
Cabinet available for only 2,195.00 this game was 3995 new a year ago.  It
is brand new and never been used.  It's a great buy if you like action
adventures games.  I think your kids will like it.  Also 4 players can play
at the same time.  It a great game with lots of hidden treasures and secret
doors.  We only have two units left and I think the skating rink in League
City, TX is going to get one.  Also would you want us to set them on free
play for you or do you want to use quarters to make them work.  It's your
choice.  It's the last picture title Gauntletebay.jpg

Let me know if you have made any decisions

Thanks,

Lutz

Congradulations Men you have finished the  regular season.  Playoff schedules are in the attachements.  Some are  finished some are only through the first round.  Those of you who did not  come to the manditory coaches meeting on Sunday PM you need to make arrangements  with me to pick up game balls.
 
Those of you who showed up to playoff  games Monday night to find that they had been cancelled so the regular season  could end have only yourselves to blame.  You could not have found out the  playoff schedule without reading the e-mail which informed you of the manditory  meeting.  Only at the meeting could we sort out wht needed to happen.   If your parents are upset, you should appologize.
 
Please call or let me know if you have any  questions.   Fred

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Jim, I talked to Joan today and she said that you were still here.  Our group reduced staff by over 50% but I am still here.  The direction of this group will be changing as we go into a bankruptcy mode.

	Take care and keep in touch.

Hi Tammy!  Thanks for asking about me!
I'm doing fine.  I have been very fortunate over the last year with this whole mess.
It just hurts to know so much pain has been created needlessly. 
I thought that things were supposed to make more sense as you grow older?

How about you and Mike?  
I hope all is well!  If there is anything I can do please let me know?

Gentlemen,

Please take a moment to review the attached document that has been sent in
to the coordinator of the CFSA Tournament volunteers.  As you will see we
are still in need of a volunteer list from most of you.  For those of you
who have turned in your list, thank you very much, your prompt attention to
this request is greatly appreciated. I know Spring Break did not help
matters much but I need to get a completed list turned in ASAP. The longer
you wait the less of a chance you will have of getting your choice.
Remember CFSA is operated on a volunteer basis.  This means the organization
will only be as good as the people that volunteer.

<FW: [Fwd: Fwd: The importance of typing your email
addresses correctly]>>
           
It seems there was this couple from Minneapolis who decided
to go to Florida for a few days to thaw out during this particularly
cold winter.
Since both spouses worked, they had difficulty coordinating their
schedules, so the decision was made to have the husband leave
for Florida on a certain day, with the wife following him one day
later.
The man made it down to Florida and arrived at his hotel.
Upon getting to his room, he decided to open his laptop and
send his wife back in Minneapolis an email. However, he left off one
letter in typing his wife's email address and sent the email off without
realizing his error.  
In another part of the country, a widow had just returned from the
funeral of her husband, a Methodist pastor of many years, who had
been called to glory just a few days earlier. She decided to check her
email because she was expecting to hear from her husband's relatives
and friends. Upon reading the first email, she let out a loud scream,
fainted and fell to the floor. 
The woman's son rushed into the room and found his
mother on the floor. He glanced up at the computer screen and saw
the following email message:

To My Loving Wife:
I've just been checked in. Everything has been prepared for your
arrival here tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then.

Your Devoted Husband.

P.S. Sure is hot down here.
