Ladies and Gentlemen:

The Resources Subcommittee has posted Appendix 1D, "Time Error
Correction Procedures," Version 2 for Operating Committee ballot.  The
OC is will consider this Appendix at its July 11-12, 2001 meeting.

Because this document is quite short, I have attached it to this e-mail
note along with existing Version 1 for reference.  These documents are
also on the NERC web site at http://www.nerc.com/~oc/standards/

1) IND-F Fiberglass Single and Extension Ladders
Certified and tested to 500 lb. load capacity, constructed of non-conductive fiberglass side rails for protection from electrical circuits and more. -- Carbis, Inc., Florence, SC
http://www.poweronline.com/read/nl20010601/433146

2) Alkalinity (hydrate)
Hydrate alkalinity or causticity is a component of total alkalinity. Boiler operators must maintain relatively high hydrate alkalinity levels when phosphate cycle treatments are used to ensure the formation of softer, more easily removable deposits. This specific test for hydrate alkalinity provides a more accurate value than the calculation method used by most operators. -- CHEMetrics, Inc., Calverton, VA

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, June 6.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
A day after upbeat profit forecasts lifted stocks, a couple
of earnings warnings knocked them back down. J.P. Morgan
Chase and Hewlett-Packard -- two members of the Dow Jones
industrials -- both projected difficult business conditions
in the quarters ahead.

J.P Morgan Chase fell 3.4 percent after warning of lower
trading revenue, and H-P shares dipped 4.5 percent after
the company said the global technology slowdown could
persist for some time. Other financial and computer stocks
fell in sympathy.

Their losses helped drag the Dow down 106, or 0.9 percent,
to 11,070. More broadly, the Nasdaq Composite fell 16 to
2,218 and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 14 to 1,270.

Energy stocks lost ground thanks to news that U.S.
inventories of crude oil and gasoline rose sharply in the
latest week. The weekly update from the American Petroleum
Institute showed a 3.4-million-barrel increase in crude
stocks and led prices of both gas and oil lower.

Exxon-Mobil shares fell 2.3 percent to 89.40, accounting
for about 13 Dow index points. Oil drillers, natural-gas
producers and refiners all saw their share prices decline.

Fewer than a third of S&P industry groups posted gains
Wednesday, and those that rose generally advanced 2 percent
or less. Health care companies, defense stocks,
consumer-products makers and electronics retailers did best.

Dear scott,

June is the time to celebrate Dads and Grads! We want to remind you that gifts from eVineyard are the perfect choice for both of them.   Of course there's our tasteful selection of more than 5,000 premium wines. Here are just two of our favorites:

Canoe Ridge 1998 Merlot, Columbia Valley, Washington
This Merlot has soft plum and chocolate flavors, a smooth feel, and an excellent finish.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247d

Piper Sonoma NV Brut, California
We like this Brut for its crisp and bright character, berry-apple fruit and faint vanilla flavors.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247f

Maybe the Dads and Grads on your list are adventure-lovers. Open the world of wine exploration to them with our Wine Clubs. Choose from five distinctive clubs, each one a trip around the world without ever leaving home. Wine Odyssey is a fun and easy way to learn about wine by tasting a carefully selected variety of premium imported and domestic labels. Our TasteTour(tm) Wine Course(tm) is a comprehensive education in wine, guided by Chief Wine Officer, Ronn Wiegand. Ronn's expertise provides just the kind of "inside information" to make a wine lover into a connoisseur.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247h

Impress everyone with your thoughtfulness and include the Insta-pull Wine Operator, the world's fastest corkscrew, with your wine gift. A gentle pull of the handle lifts any cork from its bottle instantly. You'll find many clever gifts like this in eVineyard's collection of unique wine accessories.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247m

Still stumped? Let them choose for themselves! With eVineyard Gift Certificates, Dads and Grads can handpick their own gifts from everything we offer. Fun for them, easy for you. Let the celebration begin!
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247n



Cheers,
Michael

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Thursday, June 7.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
The vagaries of semiconductor supply and demand once again
drove stock trading -- this time to the delight of
chip-stock investors. Thanks to a positive profit spin from
National Semiconductor, stocks of companies that make chips
and chip equipment soared.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1 percent, climbing 46 to
2,264. The Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500
closed fractionally higher.

But shares in the semiconductor sector jumped more than 6
percent after National Semi, despite reporting a quarterly
loss, projected better sales in the months ahead. The chip
maker pointed out that its clients' semiconductor
inventories have plummeted, suggesting they'll need to bump
up their orders sometime soon. National Semi shares surged
11 percent to 31.04, while sector heavyweight Intel climbed
4.5 percent and Applied Micro Devices rose 6.7 percent.

Chip makers' gains spread cheer to other corners of the
technology arena. Computer networkers jumped 5 percent,
propelled by a 5.1-percent gain in Cisco shares, and makers
of electronic instruments rose 3.3 percent.

About half of S&P industry groups advanced. Among the
biggest decliners were tobacco stocks, defense contractors
and photo-imaging companies. Shares of the most widely held
companies generally rose, except for modest declines in
International Business Machines, AOL TimeWarner, and
Citigroup. Overall trading volume was light.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Tuesday, June 5.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Optimistic profit reports powered technology shares
Tuesday, carrying a broad swath of the stock market higher.
Upbeat news from chip maker Xilinx, software company
Comverse Technology and even telecom-equipment pariah
Lucent inspired the kind of Nasdaq euphoria rarely seen in
recent months.

Near day's end, the Nasdaq Composite stood 3.6 percent
higher, up 78 to 2,233. Blue chips rose less markedly but
still put on a good show. The Dow Jones industrial average
climbed 114 to 11,176, largely on the strength of its
technology components (Microsoft and IBM both jumped more
than 2.5 percent). More broadly, the Standard & Poor's 500
rose 16 to 1,284.

Chip stocks and computer networkers stole the show.

Xilinx climbed 9.7 percent after the company affirmed its
earlier profit forecasts and said order cancellations were
slowing. Other makers of chips and related equipment also
rose strongly. Intel climbed 4.3 percent, Advanced Micro
Devices rose 4.7 percent and KLA Tencor advanced 7.2
percent. Many of these stocks were rebounding from big
declines Monday sparked by a worrisome April chip-sales
report.

Lucent shares surged 6 percent to 8.48 after the company
forecast improving quarterly sales figures. More than 20
million shares of Lucent changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, making it the day's most active NYSE-listed
stock. Other makers of telecom components and network
equipment fared similarly. Cisco rose 9.2 percent,
Cabletron Systems climbed 8.1 percent and Juniper Networks
rose 4.8 percent.

Among the most widely held names, only a handul of stocks
lost ground. Pfizer, Walt Disney and CNBC parent General
Electric tallied modest declines, while most other widely
recognized companies enjoyed gains.

More broadly, utilities, construction companies,
photo-imaging stocks and tobacco were among a small group
of S&P sectors posting losses on the day.

Dear Outpost.com customer,

As you may recall, I sent you an email about five weeks ago about the
tough times for dot-com companies and the tough times we were
experiencing here at Outpost.com. Amazingly, about 7,000 of you sent
us, well, they were pretty close to love letters, in response. Today
I am thrilled to be able to tell you that it now appears that, like
The Rolling Stones, we will indeed be here forever.

We have just announced that our friends at PC Connection have agreed
to acquire your favorite company, Outpost.com. The best part is that
we will remain Outpost.com and we will remain in our gorgeous
headquarters town of Kent, Connecticut. Thus, we will continue to do
business with you as we always have, with a deep commitment to you,
our customers, with our rather healthy sense of humor, and with the
enormous resources that will now be available to us through the PC
Connection family. And yes, the gerbil stays. We wouldn't have it any
other way.

The most immediate impact this will have on our business is that,
effective immediately, we have access to tens of millions of dollars
of inventory on a daily basis. This will help us speed your orders on
their way to you much sooner. The gerbil brought in some of his
buddies to work in the warehouse, so we now have many more hands
(paws?) available there as well.

Needless to say, we are awfully excited about this. PC Connection is
a company we have long admired, and to say that this is a good fit is
quite an understatement. So, the bottom line is that you are stuck
with us. We just won't go away and we plan on finding new and even
more clever ways to entertain you as you shop for a very long time to
come. As a matter of fact, we would really appreciate it if you could
help us name this silly gerbil as we are all getting tired of calling
him, "Gerbil". You can do this at:

http://www.outpost.com/template/contest/gerbil/index/

Thanks again for all your support over the past six years. It has
been an honor serving you and getting to know you.


Darryl Peck
Founder, CEO & President
Outpost.com (forever, really!)

> REVIEW: 'MOULIN ROUGE' DAZZLING, ELECTRIFYING


"Moulin Rouge" is, quite simply, a spectacular reinvention of the movie
musical. It's a movie full of color, and song, and a lot of panache. All that
style doesn't always work -- and at times things get too frantic and the
editing becomes too fragmented -- but as a whole this ambitious project flies
off the screen.



.... http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/31/review.moulin.rouge/index.html

> REVIEW: 'WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?' YES, IT IS


The title of Martin Lawrence's new picture, "What's the Worst That Could
Happen?", is meant as a rhetorical question. But it only takes about 10 minutes
of Lawrence lumbering around in especially heavy-lidded, thick-tongued style
before the unavoidable answer strikes you: The worst that could happen is this
crummy movie.

party.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Monday, June 4.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Stocks shuffled aimlessly Monday in quiet trading,
eventually closing slightly higher across the board.
Neither a healthy inflation outlook from the Federal
Reserve chairman nor a bleak semiconductor sales report
seemed to excite investors.

Blue chips sported the biggest gains as the Dow Jones
industrial average rose a whopping 0.6 percent, gaining 71
points to 11,062. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 7 to 2,156
and the Standard & Poor's 500 climbed 6 to 1,267.

Overnight, Fed chief Alan Greenspan told a Singapore
monetary-policy conference that U.S. inflation is under
control, at least as far as consumers are concerned.
Normally, that would be something to shout about. But
Greenspan blunted any optimistic response by pointing out
the reason inflation remains at bay: In order to fend off
competition and keep you and me as customers, companies are
accepting slimmer profit margins instead of raising prices.

Greenspan's comments inspired an early pop that quickly
fizzled.

The other big piece of before-the-bell news -- the
Semiconductor Industry Association's April sales report --
exerted a more lasting influence, but only on chip stocks.
The SIA said chip sales slumped 4.7 percent in April from
March. In response, producers of both chips and chip-making
equipment lost ground. Applied Micro Devices fell more than
6 percent and Applied Materials lost about 2.5 percent.
Industry giant Intel was little changed, while shares of
Cypress Semiconductor actually rose, despite the company's
profit warning.

Oil-related shares rose as crude prices bubbled higher,
this time in response to more threats of supply disruption
from Iraq. The S&P oil-drilling group climbed 2.3 percent,
while the more diversified oil-and-gas group rose 1.5
percent. Triton Energy, meanwhile, surged more than 15
percent after the company announced a huge oilfield
discovery off the African coast.

More broadly, about two-thirds of S&P industry groups
tallied gains, although nothing moved particularly fast or
far.

SCOUTING REPORT: TUESDAY
Late spring can feel an awful lot like summer. A light
economic calendar and slow trickle of earnings reports
could spell -- say it with me -- quiet trading. Of course,
making that prediction leaves one vulnerable to all sorts
of surprises. So tomorrow looks slow, but that could change
with the morning headlines.


ECONOMIC CALENDAR:
*April factory orders, forecast: -2.7 percent
*Revised Q1 productivity, forecast: -0.7 percent


STOCKS
* AOL Still Spells Growth *
Most analysts like AOL Time Warner's prospects for growing
its bottomline.
http://www.cnbc.com/010604mcreynolds-stocks.html?ReferrerID=MM

* Pick of the Week: Alliant *
Alliant Techsystems may be the best defense industry stock
to buy now, analysts say.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Thursday, May 31.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Bargain hunters made a comeback try today, but all three
major indexes are still down four days out of the past six.
Recall that only a week ago, we toasted the Nasdaq
Composite's sixth straight higher close. That was 200
points ago.

Investors initially bid stocks sharply higher Thursday,
snapping up shares beaten down in Wednesday's selloff. But
their stamina failed before a serious attempt at last
week's summit could be mounted.

Only the Nasdaq Composite managed a significant move. It
climbed 26 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,111. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 39 to 10,912 and the Standard &
Poor's 500 edged up 8 points to 1,256 -- fractional
advances for both.

One hitch might have been this morning's report on weekly
unemployment claims. The government says initial jobless
filings rose for a third straight week, while a measure of
ongoing claims hit a seven-and-a-half-year high. Stocks
usually brush off these erratic weekly labor figures. But
it's hard to ignore bad news three weeks straight.

Adding to economic concerns, a survey of Chicago-region
purchasing managers showed factory activity at
recession-esque levels in May. That's another hint recovery
could be further off than any of us would like to think.

But check your portfolio before you get start feeling too
negative. About two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks rose today,
led by those of cellular-phone companies,
photographic-products firms and health care providers.

Among the biggest losers were publishers, insurance
brokers, restaurants and precious-metals miners.

MAJOR INDEXES AND VOLUMES

SCOUTING REPORT: FRIDAY
Brace yourself for some bad news. Those weekly jobless
claims figures that have been sliding of late are about to
get backed up by another weak monthly employment report.
Forecasters think the economy lost about 90,000 jobs in
May, and they expect the unemployment rate to tick up to
4.6 percent. These numbers probably are priced into the
market already, so don't expect the bottom to fall out --
unless the forecasts prove optimistic.

ECONOMIC CALENDAR
*Nonfarm payrolls for May, forecast: -90,000.
*Unemployment rate for May, forecast: 4.6 percent.
*Average hourly wage for May, forecast: +0.3 percent.
*NAPM manufacturing index for May, forecast: 43.7.

STOCKS
* Technical Analysis Mailbag *
Given recent bearish action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 could
see more downside.

MEMORIES
"My father coached me in Little League baseball, he was a member of the
booster club. He was always very involved, and he would come to all the
games in high school and college, no matter where we were playing. He was my
toughest critic, but also my biggest supporter. My fondest memory was during
my sophomore year in college. I went down and worked out at the Phillies
complex in Florida before the Mount Union baseball team went down there for
our spring trip. My father went down and spent the whole week with me. He
loved baseball and to enjoy that atmosphere with him was very meaningful."
-- Texans Coach Dom Capers on his relationship with his father

"My dad and I are very different people, and about the only thing we have in
common is our love of sports. He calls me every week, and we talk for about
an hour. Probably 80 percent to 90 percent of what we talk about is
football. Anybody who overhears our conversations must think we're nuts. I'm
looking forward to the Texans playing next year, so my dad and I can start
going to a couple of Texans games a year at Reliant."
-- Posted in the Texans message boards by Columbia

it in the message boards!

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) is seeking comments, from
all interested parties, on proposed OASIS Business Practices and issues

The ESC's goal is to file with the FERC, the "Standardized" Business
Practices that are necessary to support the implementation of OASIS
Phase II as required by the FERC ANOPR {Docket No. RM00-10-000}.  These
standardized business practices will be filed with the FERC on August
31, 2001.

This summer, the ESC will conduct three rounds of public comment
postings.  This is the first posting and will run from May 25 through
June 11.  The ESC will compile, and respond in general, to the comments.
The ESC responses to the comments will be posted, with revisions to the
documents, at the next round of public postings.  The next two postings
are tentatively scheduled for June 26, 2001 and July 31, 2001.

The above referenced documents are available for review, and comment, on
the NERC web site: www.nerc.com <http://www.nerc.com>.  From NERC Fast

Issues Summary document before commenting.  Comments will only be
accepted on the comment form provided.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

1. LOOKING FORWARD
Our Take: Waiting Period

Economic and Market Outlook:

Two months of upswing and hesitation has crept back into the markets.  Analysts are busy downgrading sectors and stocks, stating that prices have risen too much - unsupported by the fundamentals. It is true that  industry problems are too deep rooted to be miraculously solved overnight.  The markets' rise is more likely due to a change in investor sentiment - an attitude of "enough is enough" - rather than an elimination of the problems.

However, it is also true that recovery is on its way. Inventories are  improving and  rate cuts are  spurring consumer spending. The production lines will start rolling again. The only hitch is a lengthy wait for consumer demand to translate into capital spending and a resolution of  overcapacity. The Fed is doing its best: patience is the name of the game. Till then, volatility in the market is inevitable.

Economic data expected next week includes factory orders, construction spending, NAPM services index, wholesale inventories and consumer credit.

Economic Calendar: http://www.123jump.com/econ_cal_live.htm

Earnings Outlook:

There is still a month before earnings season, but warnings season has begun. If the latest warnings are any sample of what has yet to come, investors have a right to be wary.

Name                           Date     Est EPS  Whispers
Comverse Technology (CMVT)     6/4/01    0.42     0.43

IPO Outlook:

It is heartening to finally see some activity in the IPO market.  Two months of rally have raised the spirits of aspiring firms, encouraging them to step up to the debut plate.

2. LAST WEEK

Economic and Market Update:

Following a lackluster Friday, even the Memorial Day holiday weekend  couldn't revitalize the bulls. Stocks headed steadily downward until Tuesday evening, troubled by earnings warnings, analyst downgrades and acquisition news. Tech stocks were worst hit. Wednesday was, however, a different story - investors flocked back to the stock market to buy anything from tech to Old Economy.

Networking, semiconductor, fiber-optic, software and Internet stocks were hurt most in the tech sector. Other sectors that took a beating were utilities, biotech, retail and finance. Sectors that showed strength for the first half of the week included drug, medical, insurance, chemical and paper stocks.

On the economic front, consumer confidence rose to 115.5 in May from a revised 109.9 in April. Aggressive rate cuts by the Fed and renewed strength in the stock markets have boosted the spirits of consumers. This infused hope that consumer spending may rebound.

Personal income and spending figures showed that U.S. personal spending rose faster than income. Income rose 0.3%, while spending rose 0.4% in April, in synch with analyst estimates. Weekly jobless claims rose yet again - to 419,000 last week from 407,000 the prior week.

Consumer confidence: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11666

Economic Calendar: http://www.123jump.com/econ_cal_live.htm

Company Highlights:

Mergers:
- Talks between Alcatel SA (ALA) and Lucent Technologies (LU) broke down on Wednesday amidst speculation that Lucent would accept a $23.5 billion offer that would not bring any premium to its investors. http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11681
- Conoco Inc. (COC), the fifth-biggest U.S. oil company has agreed to buy rival Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (GOU) for $6.3 billion in cash and assumed debt.
- Tyco International Ltd. (TYC), the second-biggest maker of health-care supplies, will buy C.R. Bard Inc. for about $3.2 billion. http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11691

- Morgan Stanley downgraded the networking sector saying that it may be third quarter of 2002 by the time  it turns around.
- Lehman Brothers downgraded the semi sector.

Earnings Update:

Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) posted a full-year loss for the first time.  Although earnings increased by 28% for the year, charges relating to acquisitions, especially that of Mannesmann AG,  depressed its bottom line. The stock plunged 3.7% to 188 pence on the announcement.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, May 30.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Technology stocks, including Sun Microsystems, led most
other stocks on a mass march to the downside on Wednesday.
Profit warnings, coupled with thin trading and a lack of
buyers, caused most industry groups and shares to decline.

Investors are beginning to question the widely held view
that economic growth and corporate profits are poised to
rebound by the second half of this year, analysts say.

The Nasdaq Composite Index ended down 91 points, or 4.2
percent, to 2085. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 20
points, or 1.6 percent, to 1248. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 167, or 1.5 percent, to 10,872.

The focal point of the trading day was Sun.

Sun closed down 13.8 percent at 16.10. The maker of
computer servers warned that its earnings in its fourth
quarter will be less than previously expected. It said
customers are buying less than anticipated, citing Europe
as particularly weak. The news hurt other tech companies.
Cisco, Oracle, IBM, and others also fell.

The most troubling aspect of the sell off was it touched
almost every corner of the market. Energy was the only
major industry group that managed to post a gain, which was
minimal.

Some analysts say investors should take the long-term view
when investing this summer.

SCOUTING REPORT: THURSDAY
The long wait for marguee economic data continues Thursday.
With the May jobs report looming on Friday, the help-wanted
index and Chicago purchasing managers' index should have
little impact. Earnings are nearly done but early warnings
are possible from here on out. In thin trading, funny
things can happen.

> WOODS STREAKS TO THIRD STRAIGHT MEMORIAL TITLE


Any chance Paul Azinger had of beating Tiger Woods had long since faded as the
two walked together down the soggy 17th fairway. There wasn't much to talk
about, but something still needed to be said. Azinger had entered the final
round of the Memorial Tournament with the lead, but was now seven shots behind.
Now, he thought Woods looked almost bored as he romped to his third straight
Memorial win. "I'm sorry I wasn't a better player for you today," Azinger told
Woods.

> DIAGNOSIS: AIDS THEN AND NOW



While scientists concede they may be far from a cure, today's AIDS drugs "are
nothing short of miraculous," says Dr. Jim Curran, head of the first government
task force on what was later called AIDS. Diagnosis of AIDS in the 1980s was
most often associated with quick death. It took more than a decade for
scientists to make real progress in prolonging and improving the lives of

Is current storage fill giving us 
a false sense of security? 
It's May. And those AGA storage numbers might have us feeling pretty secure about the future. But a lot can happen in a few short months. Consider these likely scenarios:
This summer hot or hotter than last summer? Predictions abound. 
Record number of new gas fired electric generation units on-line this summer, increasing demand and the draw on storage. 
Severe drought affecting hydropower, the lowest output in 30 years. 
Natural gas supply availability virtually unchanged from last year's levels.                        Fact or fiction?

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Friday, June 1.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Confused investors staged a two-act play Friday.

First, they scrambled to react to confusing reports on
labor conditions and manufacturing. U.S. companies cut
fewer jobs last month than anticipated while activity at
factories slumped further. The manufacturing figures are
roughly in line with other recent factory readings, but the
jobs release is a head-scratcher -- and that's why major
indexes bounced up and down in a tight range much of
Friday.

But sometime after lunch, investors began to bid up key
stocks and the major indexes followed.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 78 points at
10,990. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 39 to close out
the week at 2149. The S&P 500 ended up 5 at 1261.

Optimism has resurfaced that perhaps the worst is over for
technology stocks. Intel, Microsoft and Oracle advanced.
Novellus and Flextronics affirmed that their earnings would
fulfill current expectations, and shares of both companies
jumped more than 5 percent. (Sometimes "poor visibility"
turns out okay. Just keep your guard up -- second-quarter
confessionals are starting to roll in.)

Perhaps short-term money should head for the beach and
leave stock picking to the folks looking ahead six to 12
months, or longer. Surely there are bargains ready to pop,
but finding them has never been tougher.

SCOUTING REPORT: MONDAY

Next week's calendar is devoid of economic reports that
will matter five minutes after they hit the tape.
Amazon.com talks to analysts on Tuesday -- keep an eye on
that. And look for a little craziness in small-caps in
coming days. The Russell 2000 index gets its annual reset
on July 1, based on market caps as of May 31. Could be a
little scramble to front-run the indexed fund managers who
have to buy the new kids on the block.
