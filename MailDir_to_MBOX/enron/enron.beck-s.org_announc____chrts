activities.  She played a key role in making 1999 a successful year at ENA.

Wes Colwell will join ENA to lead both the planning and reporting and the=
=20
transaction support accounting functions.  Wes joined Enron in 1999 and mad=

team which assists each of Enron=01,s business units on critical issues and=
=20
deals.

Rodney Faldyn rejoins Enron from Azurix to continue to build the corporate=

Enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned=20
subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide.  Historically, the Company ha=
s=20
conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented, decentralized manner=20
allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their=20
requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance.  Today, however,=
=20
with the implementation of SAP and the profound explosion in=20
internet/intranet-based technologies, we believe the Company should change=
=20
its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategical=
ly=20
sourcing these requirements on a global basis.  We believe that there are=
=20
significant cash savings to be extracted by the Company and also commercial=
=20
potential for the formation of a highly profitable, business-to-business=20
e-Commerce venture.

Effective February 1, 2000, Enron will form a new Global Strategic Sourcing=
=20
unit.  This new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic=20
sourcing initiatives underway in the Gas Pipeline Group, Global Asset=20
Operations and Enron Corp.  Initially, Global Strategic Sourcing will focus=
=20
on aggregating Enron=01,s internal, joint venture and business partner dema=
nd=20
for products and services with the objective of creating a future=20
business-to-business e-Commerce venture.

It gives us great pleasure to announce that George Wasaff, Managing Directo=
r,=20
will lead this new global initiative.  George will report directly to Mike=
=20
McConnell, Chief Executive Officer for Global Technology.

George has been with Enron for fourteen years and has held many senior=20
executive positions, the most recent of which was Managing Director of ENRO=
N=20
South America's Wholesale Operations.  George was also the Interim Chief=20
Executive Officer of Elektro from July 1998 through June 1999 and Chief=20
Executive Officer of Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. ("TGS") from June=
=20
1995 through February 1998.  George has also held numerous commercial=20
positions including Vice President and Country Manager, Mexico for Enron=20
International and Vice President of Marketing for Transwestern Pipeline=20
Company.

Please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating=
=20
George in his new role with the Company.

Given the evolution of a number of our businesses, we have decided to make =
an=20
organizational change.  The change is in response to a number of factors. =
=20
First, as a part of our new initiative in Enron Net Works, it is becoming=
=20
clear that we have the opportunity to quickly expand Enron=01,s underlying=
=20
business model to other commodity markets.  Such an expansion requires a=20
coordinated focus on strategy as we select and develop these opportunities.=
 =20
Second, the success of EnronOnline and the continued expansion of our=20
wholesale activities in North America and Europe have increased the=20
coordination requirements across our North American and European operations=
. =20
As a result of these two factors, we are making the following organizationa=
l=20
changes effective immediately:

Cliff Baxter will move from Enron North America to Enron Corp. as Executive=
=20
Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.
Mark Frevert will become Chairman and CEO of North America, replacing Cliff=
. =20
In addition, Mark will remain Chairman of Enron Europe.=20
John Sherriff will become President and CEO of Enron Europe.

We are confident that these changes will increase the effectiveness of our=
=20
organization.  Please join us in congratulating Cliff, Mark and John on the=
ir=20
new responsibilities.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20
McConnell, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff McMahon, Chief Commercial=20
Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20
Works.  It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did =
as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=
=20
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms.

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=
=20
be a part of Enron Net Works.  The success of EnronOnLine enables us to=20
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets. In addition, the=
=20
following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their=20
current eCommerce initiatives: Harry Arora, Public Financial Securities; Ja=
y=20
Fitzgerald, New Markets Identification; Bruce Garner, Metals; and Greg Pipe=
r,=20
Pulp and Paper.

Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational=20
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business=20
opportunity.

Enron Freight
This new group under the leadership of Dan Reck is developing a business in=
=20
the inter-modal transportation area in the United States.  Shawn Cumberland=

egion.

focus and momentum we need to deliver a record performance in 2001.

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignments.

draft

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, we'd like to 
outline the following organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions, and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets, 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  
Still under consideration - The Enron Corporate Insurance group under Jim 
Bouillion will now report into the corporate organization under  George 
Wasaff.

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President and Chief 
Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to 
Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron 
Corp.  He will be responsible to Sally Beck for the business operations areas 
of the businesses.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila 
Glover, business controller for Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business 
controller for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global 
liquids and coal.  In addition, Tom Myers as Director of Accounting.  Brent 
and his team are responsible for all accounting and position reporting issues 
for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=

European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=

and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=

Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=

basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20

Draft - for your review...not sure who to say to 'report to'......although 
obviously it's you.


We are pleased to announce that Barry Pearce, Vice President, will be joining 
Enron Broadband Services as Global Controller of Trading Support Operations. 
Barry, who will be based in Houston and report functionally to both Jim 
Fallon and John Echols, will assume responsibility for the on-going 
day-to-day control and development of EBS's trading support infra-structure.

Recognizing that EBS's increasing trading operations worldwide are ever 
expanding, there is a need to insure outstanding internal controls are in 
place for all trading and risk management activities, regardless of location. 
Barry's responsibilities with regard to Global Trading Support Operations 
will mirror those of other Controller functions throughout Enron. In this 
role, Barry will work closely with Sally Beck's Global Risk Management Group 
to insure that EBS is focused on best practice throughout the front and back 
office functions, including Risk Book Management, Deal Capture, Contract 
Administration, Contract Settlements and Trading Accounting. Barry's group 
will also help ensure operational systems are developed to facilitate the 
timely and accurate reporting of all trading activities and that key 
operational procedures and processes are implemented.   

Barry has been with Enron since 1992, when he joined the company from Arthur 
Andersen. Barry has spent the last five years in London playing an integral 
part in the development and success of the support operations of ECT Europe. 
He moves to EBS from his current job as VP, European Gas and Power Trading 
Support Operations. 

Please join us in wishing Barry  success in his new role.

The New Power Company, the first national residential and small business 
energy service provider in deregulated
markets was launched today with strategic investors and partners including 
Enron, IBM and America Online.

H. Eugene Lockhart has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of 
the company.  He was formerly President
of AT&T Consumer Services and Chief Marketing Officer of AT&T, as well as 
President of Bank America's Global Retail
Bank and President and CEO of MasterCard International.  Lockhart is joined 
by a number of high-level executives from
the telecommunications and financial services sectors as well as several 
former Enron executives specializing in energy
commodity pricing, marketing, risk management and government regulatory 
affairs.   

The former Enron employees include Jim Badum, formerly Managing Director of 
Consumer Services at EES, John Henderson, 
formerly Vice President of Retail Risk Management for EES, Dave Eichinger, 
formerly Vice President of Corporate Development
for Enron Corp., and Kathleen Magruder, formerly Vice President of Government 
Affairs for Enron Corp.  Lou Pai, Chairman and
CEO for EES will serve as non-executive Chairman of The New Power Company. 

Enron will provide The New Power Company with energy commodity pricing, risk 
management, and government/
regulatory affairs.  Ken Lay is quoted in the news release, "We've studied 
the residential and small business market
for several years and believe this is the optimal way to provide value to 
these customers.  By assisting in setting up
an independent company, Enron is able to leverage its core competencies of 
energy and risk management, while
partnering with other industry leaders to give The New Power Company 
extraordinary and immediate depth and
capability."  Ken will also serve on the Board of Directors.

The New Power Company is scheduled to initially provide service in 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the second half
of 2000.  The company will be headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, with 
some operations in Houston.

As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter,=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy businesses in North America and Europe continue=
 to=20
experience tremendous growth.  The opportunities to continue to grow our=20
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical =
to=20
Enron=01,s future success that we remain focused on expanding these busines=
ses=20
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.

It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside =
of=20
gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnin=
gs=20
growth.  We have made significant progress in developing these businesses i=
n=20
North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit=
. =20
Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products,=
=20
coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credi=
t=20
trading, paper and pulp, and metals.

While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to=20
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to=20
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North Americ=
a=20
and Europe.  In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize =
on=20
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today=
=20
announcing the formation of a new business unit =01) Enron Global Markets. =
 This=20
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in=
=20
scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets.  This new core=20
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with=
=20
the North American and European businesses.

Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief=
=20
Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer.  They will=
=20
report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets.  Mark,=
=20
Mike and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global=20
Markets.

Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the=20
Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:
- Global Crude and Products:     John Nowlan
- Coal:         George McClellan
- Currency, equities, interest rate and agricultural trading:  Gary Hickers=
on
- Insurance and weather:      Jere Overdyke

Enron=01,s metals business and Enron Credit.com will remain the responsibil=
ity=20
of Enron Europe. The Paper and Pulp business will continue to reside in Nor=
th=20
America.=20

With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased t=
o=20
announce the following appointments in that business unit:
- Jeff McMahon: President and Chief Operating Officer
- Louise Kitchen: Chief Commercial Officer
- Philippe Bibi:  Chief Technology Officer

Jeff, Louise and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley,  will comprise the Offi=
ce=20
of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.

With Jeff Shankman=01,s departure from Enron North America=01,s natural gas=
=20
operation, all of Jeff=01,s direct reports will report to John Lavorato.

We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North=20

the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Dave Delainey will assume the rol=

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and

Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following

opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report

Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20

Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

Once the Arcos plant in Spain is financially closed (expected in Q2 of this 
year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on 
co-managing Enron's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts 
in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very 
closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric 
will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing 
Arcos.

We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination 
responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti 
will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric 
Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and 
Portugal and will report directly to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.

The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread 
position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility 
for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more 
likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas 
markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both Enron Global Markets and 
the Continental Gas team.

Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also 
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power 
transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will 
pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,  
and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to 
Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission 
responsibilities.

Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team 
than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages 
our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.

We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these 
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help 
make these changes as smooth as possible.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team.
