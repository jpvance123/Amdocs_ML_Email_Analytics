Louise,

Do you think we should arrange events for the remote offices as well?

Thank you,

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie

Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

Louise

I have had several informal comments from various Originators regarding running into EES at utilities and municipalities. This morning, BPUB informed me that EES is talking to them about sales to their customers under BPUB's label.

EES is now fully stepping into the Texas wholesale market with this.  Talking to 70 municipals for aggregated power is ridiculous for EES to be doing.  This has to be stopped along with EES providing the "Whitepaper" products where they are providing wholesale products to San Antonio and others.  They are making Enron look stupid in not communicating what they are doing with the wholesale desk when we are constantly finding out they are talking to customers in our SIC Codes that we have been working with toward a deal.

I think a meeting needs to be setup between Lavorato and Delainey or at your level to get this fixed.  I have tried working with my peers at EES and they continue to lie to me and keep working customers in our SIC code and even worse with IOU's and municipals.

Tom,
Will you be available for the following visit?  This is another large group...  In order to keep this from being disruptive, we were thinking of dividing the group into two for two separate overviews.  These overviews should only be 10 minutes in length.  One would be at 11:00 am and the other at 11:15 am.

Let me know if this is a possibility.

Thanks.
Jennifer

Hi Louise,

I asked each of my directs to consider 3 levels of cuts.  I told them this is strictly an exercise at this point and that we haven't been given targets (trying to keep the emotion down).  The three levels were:

 A. Remove capability for new projects but retain a reasonable ability to continue growth of our current application suite.

 B. Reduce to minimal development capability.  Retain ability for operations and minor enhancements to applications.

 C. Cut to life-support level.  Retain ability to operate the applications and fix bugs.

The cut levels are as follows:
A. Reduce by 11 (to 129)
B. Reduce by 21 (to 108)
C. Reduce by 17 (to 91)

Jeff Johnson placed himself in the A cuts, though I removed him from that cut thinking I can talk him out of it.  He is in the B cut.

Steve Stock placed himself in the B cuts.

Michael Guadarrama placed himself in the B cuts.  He said he would probably leave if the A cuts were made but would wait until we got through the transition.

Hopefully we can hold this together.

I'll try to call you to discuss.

Thanks.

I am sure no one wants to provide another were strong and stable speech, but we have it on an extremely confidential basis that a memo is being drafted by their risk management group (remember the thorn in Bill's side and mine over the last years...) that recommends a ceasing of additional business with Enron and a review of their remedies under our agreements for significant changes in our financial capacities.  I have no idea how far Dick or Tom may let this go, but it is bad form...

Arnold picked this group up from EGM because he said they were profitable and would be a good source of income.  My recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems, lawyers, credit capacity to manage them.  Unless I hear otherwise they will be gone.

Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. 
Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. 
Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.

I was envisaging something like the one talked about for Canada which is cancellable by the estate at any time.  Netco theoretically should be able to help the estate harvest the value in Feb and March where the majority of the value is for this contract.

Absolutely agree with Dave.  Any services agreement should be invisible to the market and Newco should be seen as the conterparty.  The services agreement should just pertain to the time that Newco does not have the staff to service it...as short as time as possible.

Guys, the nature, term, etc of any such agreement will have to be agreed to by Jeff McMahon. I would not be supportive of any long-term services agreement without a very close examination of the economics. A term agreement, at the right price, where NewCo continues to control the business relationship and optionality may be a win-win and provide maximum benefit to the estate.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

Subject:	Integration Meeting 

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

11am 		Tour of the building/infrastructure			Donovan

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

Attached are the latest revised Corporate Assessments for 2002.  There have been some minor changes but the major update is to the Click at Home program.  Remember that the Click at Home program assesses actual dollars so the numbers included in the spreadsheet are estimates for planning purposes.

Attachment shows where we ended up.  I really don't think it helps if we have customers read only on EOL. How does that hurt us?  It certainly helps them - I think you have a publicity nightmare too .
We should probably talk but I am more of the opinion we'll take anyone's credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially.


AEP sent us a very threatening letter.  Way outside of their contractual rights.

Louise:

It is my understanding that, notwithstanding the new vs. used election entered into iBuyit, IT deploys used prior to ordering new equipment.  It is also my understanding that this is especially the case for flat panels in light of the decision to outfit Enron Center South with new displays.

Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.

Thanks

Louise

Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

Brett Wiggs is requesting approval for $300,000 in net spend related to what appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the MHI turbines.  The DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of "Enron Americas".

Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would this be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L responsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the "Controlling Party" on the Turbine Position Report.

In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed here--an I-DASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.

Regards,

Chip Schneider

I spoke with Wayne Mays - he spoke with Coleman and Virgo and confirmed my understanding:  Wayne's RC has the following people:

Portland:
Bill Williams - Development
Mark Mullen - Development
Larry Soderquist - Transmission
Stan Gray - Transmission
Don Hamond - Transmission
Jodi Blackburn - Contracts
Patty Deas - Admin

Houston:
Walter Koffer - Transmission

Most of Walter Koffer's work is for the East, but Wayne pays for him because:
- the other transmission people are part of Wayne's world;
- West occassionally borrows people from Virgo - (1 person for two weeks, 2 people 2 hours a day for 3 months, etc.) and uses approximately one person-year. 

This totals 9 people for the west - one less than a moth ago (kraszewski already left the company).  No one else should be charged to the west. The west should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in the east.  My budget will show 8 people for tech services which means that I intend to reduce by one more - likely to occur in Q1.

As you know I have Business Flights home each year under my contract.  As I will be unable to travel to the UK due to the requirement to be in Houston over the holidays I intend to use them for my parents, borther and sister-in-law.  Any difference in the cost I intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether Enron intends to meet expense payments.

We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):

0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals)
> 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction 
Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid)
Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000
Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes)
					Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes)
Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.)
On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)

Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.

Let the games begin!

Louise

Subject:	EnronOnline Budgeting Method

As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

 To be honest you guys need to continue organizing this as we have no idea what is going on in the creditors committee - I didn't even know they were here until Mark rang me.  You can have whichever resources you want although Berney is EES.  I would suggest you continue to lead the effort though.

The E&Y representatives (for the Creditors Committee) will be back in the office tomorrow (Wednesday) morning.  They want to continue to learn about how we conduct our business and may want to pay particular attention to how we value transactions in deciding termination amounts.  This has really gone beyond what the lawyers can effectively coordinate.  Bill Bradford suggested that Berney Aucoin might be a good resource for this process to assist Fallon and Miller since he really understands how we do deals from front to back and knows who all the right people are to speak to various issues.  If you agree, would you ask Berney to focus on this?  He can give me a call in the a.m.

I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.  I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.

The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.

Thanks for your late and long hours. 

Louise

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

I just spoke with Chris Edmonds.  There are 4 basic things he is requesting of Enron:

TQ receives the right to sell API's with limited EOL transactability
Brokers would be allowed to transact on EOL numbers through TQ site
Enron would post more products and terms on their site
The term of our Agreement would extend an additional 18 months

I told him that we have not yet reached strategic closure on selling API's or continuing Broker Client internally.  Even if we decided to pursue those activities, I explained that the value proposition for Enron doing it on its own was considerably more than TQ was offering us.  I made it clear that I was not going to drop everything and work on our API strategy just so that TrueQuote could get on with their business model.  I characterized the additional product and extended term requests as subsets of the first two and therefore also off the table.

I basically told him "no" and he said he would confer with Dennis and call back later in the week.

Please let me know if you have any questions,
Brad

Got the e-mail Chris Edmonds from TrueQuote sent to you.  

First, Brad Richter and Bob Shults know Chris well and are calling him today to let him know that we understand his request to you and that we will finalize a response to him early next week.

We completed the link to them as per our legal commitment earlier in the year and send to them the products we are required to as per the contract. Bottom line, we are absolutely honoring our contract with them.  However, they want to do more and that is what we are considering. 

Now, some history.  As you know, TrueQuote was supposed to be a robust, many-to-may site and function more like ICE does today.  Well, it doesn't.  It is basically a front end for EOL prices.  As of 9/27, 288 trades have occurred  for Enron at True Quote and the majority of those have been PG&E, an owner.  In August, it averaged 4 trades a day and in September, 1 trade a day.  

Issues arose a few months ago with them when they realized that they were struggling to be a true many-to-many exchange and wanted to sell APIs as TrueQuote to other companies.  This concerned us greatly since we felt, per our contract with them, that this was a technical and security issue for us.  Webb did not like it all for system security issues and we have a right in the agreement to say no because of that.  We also talked to other companies about an API to EOL and they said they were just going to get one from TrueQuote and that concerned us as well since the only thing at TrueQuote is our prices.

The broker portion is that they want to act like broker client.  As you know, the gas desks are indifferent to broker client but East Power does not like it for reasons I can explain later if you wish.  Therefore, they want to escalate broker client at a time when we are considering its cost/benefit for Enron.

Finally, if Dynegy puts prices there as well, that may be helpful to our equity but I don't think it is a high priority for EA as a trading company.

I discussed all this with Louise a month ago and I believe she supports our path.  I will check with her and Lavo Monday to make sure they are in agreement with any response we give to Chris.

Let me know if you need more info or want me to check with you as well before we respond to TrueQuote.

Thanks.

Greg Piper

Greg:

I need your guidance regarding a few issues currently outstanding with respect to the True Quote / EnronOnline relationship.  Practically speaking, Enron's internal decisions will determine the fate of True Quote in its current form.  I will outline the issues below and await your response.

We are closing in on a deal that will connect DynegyDirect to the True Quote platform.  We believe True Quote would have a strong competitive advantage against ICE if we have a commitment from Enron and DynegyDirect.  We are hestitant to move forward with Dynegy until we have a complete understanding of our relationship with Enron.

True Quote has made a proposal to EnronOnline that would create a revenue stream to Enron in return for a larger product commitment from Enron.  We are waiting on a response from Enron. 

True Quote needs the ability for brokers to transact with Enron through the True Quote interface.  We have agreed to the same terms and conditions as the Broker-Client product offering.  We are waiting on feedback from Enron.

We are confident True Quote would be greatly successful if we could execute the strategies outlined above.  We want to have a win-win relationship with Enron that allows us to shape the marketplace and compete aggressively against ICE. Due to the critical nature of these discussions and the associated timing, I chose to write you and ask for your guidance.  Right now, we need to know which direction Enron plans to take.  Regardless of the direction, our time is running short.  It is with the greatest respect for the way we began this relationship, that I ask you to help us evaluate this opportunity.

Should you wish to discuss these matters further, please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at virtually any time via my cell phone at 502-558-2568. 
  
Best regards,
Chris

Re-sending with minor changes to the prior documents.  A clean copy is now provided.

Lance Schuler advised me that it is now Jeff Donahue, rather than Mark Metz, that needs to sign off on Corp's behalf, and that either Tim Detmering, Louise Kitchen or John Lavorato can approve on behalf of ENA.

 << File: 092701 ABB Power T&D Co. Inc. Confid Agr-No Separate Agreement.doc >>  << File: 092701 ABB Power T&D Co. Inc. Confid Agr-No Separate Agreement-Clean.doc >> 

A redraft of the ABB confidentiality/exclusive dealings agreement is attached for review and comment.

This document is based on the form ABB provided and for which ABB has expressed a strong preference.  

This draft calls for bilateral exclusivity for the Term (2 years).  As several of us have discussed, this will prevent ENA from choosing an alternative technology or supplier during that time should it choose to construct a DC transmission line within a 15-mile radius of San Francisco.  As I understand it, we are prepared to link arms with ABB to do this project because ABB is the premier supplier of this type of equipment. 

Based on recent discussions between Wayne and ABB, the language necessary for creating the exclusivity arrangement has been added to the form of confidentiality agreement that we had been working on with ABB earlier.  The added language is somewhat lengthy, but was necessary to establish the relationship and at the same time protect ENA against arguments that we are obligated to proceed with the potential transaction.  

Because this transaction does commit ENA to exclusivity obligations I understand that we will need to talk with Tim Detmering and Mark Metz about the transaction.  

Please let me know of comments.

Today's issue of e-Biz has the following article in "Short Cuts"...

The 'Kitchen' is Hot
Fortune has ranked Louise Kitchen the 17th most powerful woman in corporate America. Louise, COO of Enron Americas, was recognized as the driving force behind EnronOnline, "begging, borrowing and stealing smart people" to get the commodity trading web site off the ground. In compiling the annual list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, Fortune considered the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go -- and the influence she has on mass culture and society.
Topping the list are No. 1, Carly Fiorina, chairman & CEO of Hewlett-Packard; No. 2, Meg Whitman, president and CEO of eBay; and No. 3, Oprah Winfrey, talk show host and chairman of Harpo Entertainment Group. The list appears in the Oct. 15 issue of Fortune.

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

Do we have any corporate allocation number from UBS?

The view is that the CapEx  hold is across the company and your counterpart probably hasn't raised the issue of buying anything with higher management.  Suffice to say our guys have confirmed they don't think the bid is real.

I'll talk to Frevert but I really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again.  I would hope for a major change in format.

Yes, partly.  I saw John last week and he told me that his wife was due to deliver their second child on November 9 and he would possibly miss the conference.  However, I know Mark was also interested in having women represented and liked having both you and Janet on the panel to balance things out.

I know you'll do a great job -- you always do!

Subject:	Management Conference - Business Unit Panel


Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

So far we have spent today relooking at our numbers for the whole business.  Technology is looking about the same as before (possibly 10 -  15 less in Jay's area).  I think it would be a good idea for you to come down and have dinner with either myself or myself, Jenny and Jay together tomorrow.  Hutch is coming down tomorrow night.

We are at 196.5 Bcfs, and Origination of $4.3 MIllion.  We don't have "mini-books" to calculate our mark to market, but we'll have it ready this morning for you. 
By the way, we closed a Financial Zinc Deal, with Galvak (Alfa Group), in which we made around $75k. The customer bought a fixed price and a tunnel, for a total of 45,600 tons. We negotiated it with Enron Metals (London Group), and it was back - to - backed with ENA.

I've left him a msg that if his schedule permits he should plan on swinging by the office to chat briefly with dave and a few of his guys if it can be arranged. Sounds like he's making a social call btwn business calls but I want to discuss what other lp's are telling him about lack of activity and remind him our 1 year roll option is coming due soon. Many other general market issues as well.

Dear Linda

I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.  We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.

I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.

I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.

I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.

Regards

Louise Kitchen

I have an important question, so I'll e-mail it to you so you have time to
respond accordingly. I'm creating the final list of which of the "Key Women
in Energy" will be attending the awards ceremony in Essen, Germany on 14
February, and don't have a response from you yet. If you'd like to attend,
we'd love to have you. At the same time, I understand your world is changing
daily. All the same, it might be nice for you to meet the other women and
for the other women to meet you. Please do let me know if you plan to
attend, or, given your schedule, if there is the possibility you could
attend.

So far, I think there are 15 women who have committed to attend - from as
far away as Australia, the US, the UK, Bulgaria and Germany. We're all
gathering for dinner on Feb. 13, and many of us are meeting earlier than
that to explore the German countryside. I've been taking German lessons all
winter so hopefully we'll get by.I'd be glad to help better understand the
conference setting and details if you'd like. Several of us are gathering in
Essen over that weekend and early that week to meet one another, share a
meal, and get to exchange stories. You've personally done much for the
energy industry and might be surprised what a warm welcome you could receive
for your extensive efforts to lead the team that built EnronOnline.

Please do let me know so I may complete reservations, etc. Many of us are
staying at the same hotel, so it should be interesting.

Really you need to do it.  Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.  Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.  Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.  I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.  STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ? (ask legal).
 
Leave binders,etc for now.  Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).
 
Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.
 
Liz can cover - have a great time.  Pick up your tickets early in the day.

Is it okay if I get Jesse(our clerk) to pack your files?  I want to confirm what you wanted packed.  All files except your EOL files.  Does this mean all binders in bookcases as well in your cabinets?

Is it okay to tell people that are calling for you that you are in London?  I told Pat O'Donnell you were in London but reachable.

Also,  do you want someone to sit in for me while I'm out?  I talked to Liz and she thought she would be fine but I wanted to check with you.

Pat

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

Hope this helps.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary
Portland
San Francisco
Chicago
Denver

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Our little Rafferty was very pleased to see her mum and Personal Trainer Rita.

She was calm and sleepy and did lots of stretches and she stood still when we put her collar and leash on - gooood girl! No mess in her kennel either.

She did not go potty, but we had a good walk about. It's cool and shady up there - no problem with the temp.

She got an extra nice treat for being a good girl going back in her kennel - no cries - she's the best.

Bob and Wayne,

It appears that our commercial group is discussing whether to suspend payments on the MHI engines claiming Force Majeure, basing this on the recent terrorist activity. Is this a path we want to follow, and is this supported by Enron management?

I'm quite concerned that this will only lead to more confusion, high legal costs, and difficulty with disposing of these assets, similar to the problems that have been created with the Westinghouse D5A.

If this is supported by upper management, I would like to know so I am prepared to deal with the results of the situation.

Thanks!

Mike

Tammie -- Happy New Year.  I am preparing a plan for designing/printing collateral materials (stationary, envelopes, etc.) for Newco since we will need to do a big mailing announcing the new trading web site. 

It occured to me that Newco employees will want new business cards as well.  Is the buyer going to handle printing business cards for us?  If not, I can help mock up some designs and talk to some printers about getting them printed quickly.  My thought was that we send out an e-mail to employees (around Jan 14th) with an order form where employees can put in their business card info. and submit to me.  Our group can collect all the orders and hire a printer to do one mass business card print run.  This will save money and create a consistent look for business cards.  When you can, pls. let me know what you think.

Thanks

Kal

Attached are clean and marked copies of the online trading GTCs for physical power which I have generally discussed with Bryan Murtagh (UBS). You will note that we have elected to use the EEI form by incorporation as we believe this will be the most marketable approach understanding that different forms will be required for many players, eg WSPP.

I will be doing a final review over the weekend and expect this form to be final by Monday am.  If you have any questions/comments, please let me know.  

By copy of this email to Genia, I would ask for her help in cleaning up the document (sorry, beyond my current skills, hopefully, soon to be broadened) and would ask Leslie to carefully review and provide me any thoughts/comments.  Based upon this document, we will have ready by Monday pm, the long form EEI for regular negotiation.

Nothing we need right now.  Things he may need to know:
1.  Pleased with our relationship so far.  Looking forward to market opening.
2.  We are discussing a number of other possible transactions with them including:
Possible options (either our call or their put) for power from the Bruce A units 3&4.  They are attempting to bring these back on line.  This deal would help them ensure the economic viability of doing the refurbishment.  I believe these would not come back until fall 2003 at the earliest.
Short term deals for early next year after market opening
Possible purchase of green power from their wind units at the Bruce

We are also trying to work more closely with them on the lobbying front for market opening.  This may be something he should try to sniff out to see whether they really care if the market opens early next year or not.  The people over here seem to be talking the talk that they do.

Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.

Subject: Conn. Coal Plants


As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

The transaction for the sale of the New Albany Peaker Plant just closed.  Paul Garcia of Enron treasury confirmed that we received the wire transfer of the purchase proceeds from Duke. 

I would like to personally thank everyone that was involved in the sales process.  This transaction went very smoothly and I received several compliments from our counterparty regarding our professionalism on this deal.

Please take all post-closing actions that are required to finally consummate the conveyance and also be aware that the Purchase and Sale Agreement requires us to keep any and all data or information regarding the project and the transaction confidential for a period of two years.  In order to comply with the foregoing provision, I would strongly suggest that conversations regarding this transaction be limited to only those Enron employees who have a "need to know."

Thanks

Stuart

Let's get some time tomorrow.

Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  Greg has decided that Rick will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.

Let's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too.

No

The Weather group is the Meterologists and the Crude group are the original Fred Lagrasta marketers who were spun off under Randy Maffett - they will be brought back into the fold for gas marketing.

So we don't need mid/back office support.

The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.

Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kevin would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  

Let's discuss.  --Sally

I thought it may be helpful to introduce Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  The attached document is a high level outline of what needs to be done between ourselves and the buyer.  

Should UBS be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name "ubsenergy.com".  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.

The only contracts out before a bidder is awarded are the PA and ETA.  Essentially the set up agreements for online trading.  The PA is one page and the ETA several.  These are standard and not long.

Thanks. Will talk with you tomorrow. One issue that should be discussed is
the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today. My guess is that
any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
will want to use as well as credit department needs. And so sending out
language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder. This is only a
timing issue I think but is important nonetheless.

Doesn't reflect badly, rather the opposite.  You should also have had a voicemail from John.

See you when you get back.

Let's also talk about your contract when you're back.

Louise,

I appreciate your candid feedback.  

My frustration was the unproductiveness of the events of Friday and Monday.  If we could harness all the energy being utilized internally and redirect it to new business in our external markets, I believe we would have an unprecedented market advantage.   I do understand some amount of politics is "a necessary evil".  

Give me a call in Chicago if we should discuss this further.  I do not want this ordeal to reflect badly on myself or anyone else involved.  I can be reached at 312/541-1225.  I depart around noon in my return to Houston.

Laura

We have resolved the issue partly.  John now reports directly to Hunter.  Give me a ring to discuss.  I felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed, quite rightly so I think we have solved most of the problem.

By the way - give me a date and I'll be in Chicago.

Subject:	Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project


The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

Subject: Integration Meeting 

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday. The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule. This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive. I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense. 

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

9 am Introduction

9:15 am Infrastructure Rub

10 am IT - Development & Ops Webb

12 noon Accounting, cash etc Integration Overview Colwell/Georges/Meyers

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie

Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Excellent.

On support side. My guess is that Colwell, Headicke, ENW (Beck/IT), Research, Tax, Comp. Analysis, PR and HR would prefer one meeting to do their areas rather than 6 for their people in each BU. Can we adjust for this?

Equally, what's your view on Global Finance?

Here is our plan on PRC.

Assistants:

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings.

Non Commercial but in North America:

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC.

Analysts and Associates

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria.

VP's

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay.

Cheers as you Brits say

> For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and
the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on
this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to
complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial
groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start
the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.
 The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something
we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's
about it on the non-commercial side.

Good morning Louise and thank you for the above  order.  I will outline some framing and shipping costs below as  requested.  I just wanted to confirm that the print you have ordered is not  exclusively a large Limited Edition print.  This image is also available in  the 11" and 18" sizes and is an edition of 2000.  The price of this image  remains the same throughout the edition and does not increase as per your other  large images i.e. Field of Rainbows and Three Sisters.
 
40" Mount and Mat (Black Matting) $99.30 or $90.27  GST exempt
40" Black Mat / Pewter Frame  $294.90  or  $268.09 ex GST 
40" Black Mat / Black Aluminium Frame (same as  Pewter frame)
(This includes High Quality Acrylic inserted  instead of glass)
 
Freight for either option $202.00
 
I hope this helps with your decision and I have  attached a sample image just help with your selection.
 
Look forward to your decision
 
Cheers
Fay

Don't worry about the Baby not turning over,  It took Katiana a while to turn over also as she is off the charts as far as size and length, it also took her a while to walk but she is doing fine now. How old is he now and how much does he weigh?  

Nadine is doing fine, she is working part time and seems to be happier - I am loving being a Daddy :)

As far as EBS, OH yeah, lots of nervous people... there is still however some more cleaning up work to do so I think I'll be OK.

Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??)

(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month
	Probability:	50%
	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

(iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)

Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.

This in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until April.  All of these would be IT applications support.  I would feel comfortable naming names, so if you think you have 5 temporary spots for these people and need names, I will get them to you.  Thanks.  --Sally

I think it would be a great idea if we could get a few extra spaces for
IT support in the new building.

We would need five spots.

Two for Enpower (one for risk, and one for volume mangement and confirms)
Two for Unify (one for logistics and one for EDI)
One for Gas Risk

I won't make requests for specific personnel (yet)  just not the most junior
personnel. 


Let me know if you need anything else.

thanks

bob

The following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online trading.  These contracts govern the actual transaction process and are accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically.  
Password Application	-  In writing
Electronic Trading Agreement	- Electronically

These documents do not have any customer specific terms (eg credit etc) as they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions, but simply the utiliszation of the website.  The General Terms and Conditions will be issued to the known Buyer as they do have credit terms etc.

Please let me, Dave Forster or Mark Taylor know if you would require further information.

All,

Further to your recent discussions surrounding the ENA Origination Track I will shortly be scheduling an interview date for you to interview recommended candidates.    You have already received the attached list of suggested candidates and as I understand it you have no comments on these individuals thus far.   

In order to match the success of the ENA Trading Track it requires your 100% commitment and participation in the following areas:

1.	Interviewing
2.	Training
3.	Mentoring
4.	Promotion of the Track

I will contact each supervisor of the attached list of candidates to gain further feedback on these candidates, prior to contacting them, and ensure their respective buy-in.

 << File: List of potential candidates.xls >> 
If you have any questions please call me.

I look forward to working with you on this Track.

Kind regards,

Karen Buckley

Louise,

As I am sure you are aware, our current plans on Fort Pierce include going back to FPUA and being honest with them (i.e. letting them know that the transaction as currently structured is not likely to proceed).  The goal of our meeting with FPUA is to be both fair and honest and to provide them with the opportunity to make the project more feasible by making economic concessions.  One concern that I have heard is that FPUA may incorrectly assume that our visit has little to do with the reason mentioned above and more to do with Enron's recent troubles.  Because FPUA is a municipal entity and this project has been closely followed by the media, this discussion is likely to make it into the newspapers and any conclusions reached by FPUA may be announced for all the world to see.  Do you have any suggestions for how this situation should be handled?  Should Eric Thode be consulted?

Stuart

Pretty much correct.  Actual is:

Curry	$20,439,468
Sukaly	$0 (somehow 4 midmarketing deals I did got credited to Sukaly so I moved the $27,602 to me!)
Ahn	$12,181 (associate)
Jester	$10,000 (just started in group a couple of months ago)

Doug Gilbert-Smith supported me from the trading side to help get the wind deal done and he has been paid 50% of its value $18MM.  No one else was working with me on the wind deal other than support groups.  Portz in legal was instrumental in getting the contract done with Enron Wind.  Edith Cross and Greg Trefz in structuring also pulled long nights to get the deal approved.

Thanks, - Mike

Louise,

Jim Fallon told to wait for explicit intructions from him
before any transfer to NETCO takes place. He is my current boss.

I am afraid we are caught up in a legal mess here. All I need 
is a formal letter or an E-mail. Another alternative is to extend 
employment of some of my guys who are supposed to help with the transistion.

This is the procedure which currently is documented in the Product Control Function concerning the validity of a signature.

Subject:	The procedure


There are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a Password Application:

1) Direct knowledge of the individual signing. The energy community is relatively small. In most cases, we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past. 

2) Ostensible Authority.

3) 3rd Party Verification.

For 3rd Party Verification, the following procedure is used after Credit, Legal and Contracts departments have approved the Counterparty for online transactions:

?	The Main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the Trading Department is requested

?	A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded.

?	Date, Name, Title and Phone Number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places:  1) Access Tracking Database and 2) Online Trading Operations Control Form and 3) Recorded telephone conversation.

The Master User ID is forwarded to the customer only upon the verification of the authority of the applicant.

John L. suggested I pass of this request to you.  

As you work a deal for NewCo I wanted to make sure that we include the various tools we use in structuring for pricing and evaluating deals (i.e., we want to make sure the NewCo will have the exclusive rights to this information).  Kelli has provided a basic list of this information below.  Most relates to the exotica functions (and any associated code) that Research has created for structuring deals.  I am forwarding a copy of this to Jim Meyn to see if he has any additional needs.

Thanks.

I have been notified that TD Securities will be coming Wednesday morning for due diligence on NetCo.  They will arrive between 8 and 8:30am with a team of 9 people and plan on being here through Thursday night.   I will be coordinating things for them on the corp dev side.  Please let me know who your commercial coordinator is and the schedule for the first day presentations.  

The data room is currently located in ECN3371; however we are trying to find a room that would be more accomodating for such a large group.

I will send you the names and titles of TD's team as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Scott 

Mark Taylor forwarded me your request, I thought it may be helpful to introduce myself and Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  As Mark probably already informed you we are taking the opportunity to update the PA and ETA.  Under the timescale we do plan to have these with you today.  

Should Citigroup be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name "citigroupenergy.com, 'ssmbenergy.com' or 'ssbenergy.com'.  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.

Thanks

Louise

Louise & John --

FYI.  

1.	Charles Yeung has decided to leave the company.  He was in the ERCOT box support Doug Gilbert-Smith.  

2.	I met with UBS counsel today to discuss FERC and other licensing issues.  I am scheduled to meet with Bob Dinerstein (sp?) sometime tomorrow to discuss the function and some other administrative issues.

3.	We continue to gather tariffs, etc. to process the forms as soon as possible.  Of course, the ability to sell physical power will be contingent upon FERC approval of Netco's MBR authority.

4.	I have postponed the FERC meeting scheduled for Thursday until sometime next week.  I still believe that it is appropriate to meet with FERC post-Bankruptcy Court approval (maybe HSR approval?).

Thanks,

Jim

We have resolved the issue partly.  John now reports directly to Hunter.  Give me a ring to discuss.  I felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed, quite rightly so I think we have solved most of the problem.

Dave,

The download from EOL contract database is not the Day 1 contract list we will be using.  Disregard the Contract/Name Type column in your attachment.  There are only six initial contract types.  Master Gas, Master Power, ISDA and corresponding GTCs.  Also, we will adjust the initial contract requests by Credit Approvals.  We need to be consistent in what we are communicating to UBS and internally.

Thanks,
Bill

Subject:	Contracts listing

Attached is a list of company legal names, with Enron contract types identified, which some of the recipients of this email have requested.

The GROUPS represented on this list roughly correspond to the groups on the various lists in circulation and should be relevant for relaunch.

The list I sent out earlier today contained some company names which had been identified by commercial groups as Top 50, but in fact will not be trading on day 1 as they do not trade the products which we are planning to launch on day 1.

Accordingly, we will send out a new list tomorrow morning, which will contain:

- Names of pipelines or transmission companies needed for day 1
- Names of Canadian companies needed for day 1

The revised list will show only those names incremental to the "Louise approved" list currently being used by credit and will contain the full legal name of the relevant entities.

To avoid any confusion, I suggest you delete the last list I sent you and use the "Louise approved" list along with tomorrow's list.

If anyone has any questions, please contact me on:

office: 713 853 1861
cell: 713 562 8678

Thanks,

Dave

Sensitivity: Confidential


Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

I would hope that in the negotiations of the master we can remove the confirm provision.

Let's discuss Monday

Couple More:

1) I heard a rumour that we will not be sending confirms when we relaunch. Is this correct? (I hope not)

2) Have you thought more about the PA's without Buyer name issue?

Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?

The last I heard was that you wanted legal to prepare a physical power GTC which was similar to what we had online before and Leslie Hansen was trying to convince you otherwise.

The supplied document is nine pages of elections and amendments to the EEI. The EEI itself is not included.

The blank lines in the elections sheets are, I am told, optional, and are included in order to give a true representation of the standard elections sheet to the EEI. Obviously, when displayed online, these blank lines cannot be filled in.

The GTC provided below is the EEI.

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Subject:	Expenses

I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.

I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.

This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.

Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:

11/13/01	4,069:72	(cheque which bounced)
11/10/01	21,010:15	(never reached my account although showing paid)
11/10/01	3,319:40	(never reached my account although showing paid)

Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.

In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.

In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.

Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.

EES has been soliciting bids for some of its larger markets. (CA, IL, NY, OH, etc)  To date the bids have been dismal.  We are down to one player looking at one market and they are bidding $0.30 on the dollar. ($US)  These deals are clean and could be managed fairly easily by NETCo.  It might be a stretch, but this morning, management suggested we find out if NETCo can do some due dilligence at this time and determine if we want to bid on some of the book.  I am available at (713) 345 4441 if someone wants to discuss.

The overall IT budget was brought down from 25.4MM to 16.3MM. 

Please review for any final comments as well as you comments on allocations.  Please note that the largest item was power fundamentals (6.2MM) which has bundled in it remote support, VMS support ect, it is IT's overall catch all accounts that require direct support of delivered  systems.

	Please see the attached file that reflects the multiple for each asset sale.  As you can see for assets that had losses, we show no multiple.  Additionally, there are some assets that have no EBITDA at all (that we are aware of), thus we show no multiple.  Please let me know if this is what you expected.  Thanks!

Subject:	Management Conference - Business Unit Panel


Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

Subject:	RE: Transfers  to Netco

Information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to (i) confidentiality provisions with counterparties and (ii) with respect to power, the need for FERC approval .  Everyone seems to be comfortable that the identity of counterparties can be disclosed, as well as the counterparties contact information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular counterparty.  Consequently, the software going to Netco will  be cleansed of the trade data and individual's data bases and files should be similarly cleansed.

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?

Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Under the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally

Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.

Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders.

Don't know if this will still reach you - over here Enron staff have all

Worried about you both - will the Standard Power offer mean you might still

do to help?

There seems to be some confusion around who will own the intellectual property for the treasury workstation application.  It was Mary's and my understanding that the IP would remain with the estate and a license would be given to Netco to use the application.  Jay was under the impression that the IP was to be transferred to Netco.  Could someone please clarify.  

The estate (Mary Perkins) would like the IP to remain with the estate.  If this is a problem - please call Mary directly.

Went VERY well.  Lots of positive vibes afterwards and goodwill towards both of you.  People most appreciated executives admitting to the fact that things were wrong and they were frustrated too, but everyone needs to get over it.  Big change from past history of blaming everyone but ourselves and just glossing over the real problems and making them sound better....

Side note:  JL uses the word "I" a bit too much.

If we have twins - doesn't it matter that we make more money for American Pie than we do with Hans - due to bigger group of people.  Therefore percentages need adjusting.  Or are we done?

Louise, attached is a spreadsheet with details regarding setting up pipeline transportation contracts for NETCO. In addition to the contract setup, Gas Logistics is working with the IT group on the splitting of the Estate and NETCO trading environments. 

Note: The prioritization of what pipes to tackle first was dictated by the Gas Desk Heads.

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  

Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally

I have asked some of the originators to supply me with information re: EES approaching their customers. So far, I have received the following, all of which have occurred within the last few months:

1) Citgo Refining - Last month, we provided pricing for a facility in IL.  The customer indicated he already had a non-competitive bid from EES. 
2) AE Staley - the customer indicated he had recently been dealing with a representative from Enron Direct.  This was rectified when the rep left Enron last month.
3) Dow, Air Products, Praxair - EES spoke to them about a put option.
4) Abitibi, Shintech, Alcoa, Solutia, Kinder Morgan have all been approached by EES.

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Louise

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.

5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?

Laura

Subject:	Re-start/Integration Planning

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Apart from the practicalities - Only Enron Canada and Enron Australia have the right to trade in the North American markets.  Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.  ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.   So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.  

The practical issues are still huge but I thought I'd tell you this.  No-one has rung me yet.

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

Tammie just informed my assistant that the space where the plotter is slotted to be cannot be turned into a people spot because there is a big pole in the way.  So, I am back to needing one more space.

Let me know what can be done.

Bill may want to do a contract for Sachs at around 20/20. He's thinking about it and will let me know. Apparently RWE are chasing him.

NETCo ee's with nearly 5 years service at Enron
We have about 10 people who had they stayed at Enron estate for another 30 - 60 days would have vested in the Enron pension plan (cash-balance plan). We have tried to find some way to make something work here, but as it stands it looks like the are going to have to transfer on 8th of Feb and forfeit whatever was in this plan (roughly 5% of base salary per year and it is a 5 year service vesting arrangement). You may hear some noise.

A.  EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.    

Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  

1) Access new markets and customers
In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  

2) Manage high volume of products and transactions
Enron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.

To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].  Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.
 
3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line

EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives. 

Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  

Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

Liz,

	I work for Anthony Dayao as part of the EES IT group but formerly was in Enron Net Works under Steve Stock and met Louise briefly in 1999.  I'm in the middle of the Rice University Executive MBA program and for one of our final exam questions, we are permitted to consult internal resources.  The question is regarding how we (Enron)  have used the Internet to differentiate ourselves from other organizations (Competitors) in the industry.  During our Rice MBA classes, EOL was brought up several times so it's considered very highly by the school.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention its strengths during our exam.

	My professor has provided me assurance in writing (Email) that any answer will not be published.

	I appreciate Louise' and your time in helping me on this school exam paper.

	Regards,

Exam Question:

2.	Working with whomever you deem is appropriate in your organization, identify the three organizations in your industry, which in your opinion, use the Internet and World Wide Web the best.

If your organization is not one of the top three, what does it need to do on the Internet and World Wide Web to move to the "best" category? If your organization is among the top three organizations in your industry, what uses of the Internet and World Wide Web have differentiated your organization from other organizations in your industry?

I hope you and the family managed to get home for Christmas - I know Swift thought it was uncertain when we last spoke to you.  Judging from the papers, you must be in the thick of it - I hope you do better than BP's published offer for the Enron Online software!

If things don't work out and you find yourself homeward bound, spare a moment to ensure than any taxes due to be paid by Enron are up to date - we have been struggling to get someone to focus on a UK tax liability created in April 2000 when Tom exercised options (in the US) and for which a much greater US dollar tax withholding was made by Enron at the time - but no-one bothered to pay the Inland Revenue!  It seems that we are making some progress at last in that it is being submitted to the Cash Management Committee for consideration - do you know whether its possible to lobby that body???!

Best wishes to you all - just got back from Gymboree's exercise class for 2 year olds!  Tom is at his career transition counselling service - I've got my fingers crossed that his next career isn't too bizarre!

9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

Louise -

Claudia also mentioned a UBS handbook which has descriptions of the various UBS businesses - would you like copies of this as well?

I also sent an email to Chris and Rob to see if they need materials for Portland and Calgary.

Thanks for your order confirmation of the black matting only.  As this print

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

Sabra Dinari

>
> 2.  Enron NA/GSCM - Interest Rate Swap Portfolio - At Enron NA's option,
> we would either (a) close out and portfolio on Nov 21, 01, resulting in a
> payment from GSCM to Enron NA or (b) bilaterally reduce applicable margin
> trigger from $10mm to zero, which based on current MTM would result in
> $10mm of additional margin being paid by GSCM to Enron NA.
>
> Weather Derivative Transaction - Applicable margin trigger would be
> reduced from $50mm to $5mm, which based on current MTM would result in
> ~$18mm of margin being paid by GSCM to Enron NA.
>
> 3.  Enron NA/J. Aron - Financial Derivative Portfolio - At Enron NA's
> option, we would either (a) close out and portfolio on Nov 21, 01,
> resulting in a payment from J. Aron to Enron NA or (b) bilaterally reduce
> applicable margin trigger from $10mm to zero, which based on current MTM
> would result in $10mm of additional margin being paid by J. Aron to Enron

>
> Physical Natural Gas Receivable - In consideration of the foregoing, Enron

Dave, as per previous discussions, I am very concerned with Canada not using UBS AG as the contracting party. Additionally, Lou Eber has confirmed with me a number of times that UBS AG does not guarantee subsiduaries but rather UBS is " good for it". This will not work.

This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.

A great reflection on you guys too.

Ref: Houston Chronicle website
* * * * * 
Tuesday, Dec. 4 
I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
* * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

George,
 
We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place -  we are way below others for costs.  Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?

Greg:
 
As you know, we have used DealBench as our auction platform since inception and have been very pleased with the results.  Unfortunately, the costs associated with this proprietary platform make it cost prohibitive for Enron to sustain.  I would suggest that the more prudent approach is to determine the aggregate demand for such services and to utilize GSS to contract and manage a third party service/auction platform for Corp. and the commercial business units.

Subject: DealBench in 2002



As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.

Thanks

Louise

Subject:	Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions 

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows: 

Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees 

Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop,
											Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA
											Operations, including Calgary)
	
Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering,
											Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)

Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)

			3 - 4pm		EB3314		ENW: Operations & IT Dev.	Wes Colwell,Faith Killen, Louise 
											Kitchen,Sally Beck, Beth Perlman,
											Mark Pickering, Greg Piper, Kerry
											Roper, Bob Hall (added-EA 												Operations) 

I look forward to reviewing details with you in each of these meetings.  --Sally

Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.

In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

The attached spreadsheet represents a schematic of the ECS 5th floor.  Louise has taken the time to assign locations and number of desks to the various groups.

The Upstream group is located in desks 410-413, 416-419 and 425-426.  I recall that your original request was for 15 spaces, however Louise has allocated 10.  Please assign names to these desks and return to me by end of day Wednesday.  Please include first and last names to assist IT with workstation audits.  

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Jennifer doesn't know it yet, but when I submitted final numbers to HR, I kept her suggested increases and did not apply her suggested decreases (which she did to balance the increases).
 
I expect we are going to lose some people. I hope the ones that go are not the best ones. Obviously, the more we are willing to spend in bonus, the fewer the people we will lose. 
 
When would you like to get together to discuss?

Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer

Greetings:
 
As this extraordinary year draws to a close, we've been cooking up something to laugh about.  Click on the link below to see our latest animation, a fable about the Dotcom business.  Although the animation does not have a particular holiday theme, we offer it in the spirit of the season, and we hope you will enjoy it.  The animation has been compressed in both the latest Windows Media Player streaming format, and the QuickTime 5 format, so one of those is needed on your computer to view a playback.
 
Happy Holidays, and Best Wishes for the coming New Year.

Firstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry.

Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each.
It works - we have enough people to do it.

In terms of the Estate:
The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.

In terms of NewCo:
EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

Louise,

Sorry to bother you with this request, but I'm not sure who else to ask:

A number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like.

Are there publically available documents covering the auctions process and descriptions of compliant bids?

How far is that (the airport they usually fly too) from downtown.  It is probably a good idea to go and stay downtown

Ray

Essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in (but when is).  Its a reassurance meeting please help if you can.

Joe Bob Perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially (one month ago) so assume everything you say get's made public.

The fact we are doing 3500 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him.

Thanks

Ray,

Eddie Meche (CRO) and Jim Bob Perkins (President) from Reliant will be meeting with you and I in your offices at 8:00AM.   The purpose of the meeting is to continue to educate Reliant on our current financial position.  They have been supportive in the market until last week where they came out with a public announcement with concerns about Enron.  Our hope is to give them further disclosure to get them comfortable with our near term and long term financial plans.  They have $100mm gross exposure ($50mm net exposure) to Enron and have recently slowed trading volumes.

Feel free to give me a call if you need further breifings.  I will be in the office about 7:00AM.

Thanks,
Bill

 For all you guys who had dealings with Structure ...

---------------------- Forwarded by Sean Dodd/EPETL/EASTERN on 11/01/2002 09:39
---------------------------

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

We now have a structure in place dealing with Enron Americas estate and ensuring that we best maximize all of our contractual and asset positions.  This team will be headed by Don Miller going forward please help him and the team as this is our highest priority.

Some areas of this organization remain blank and will be completed by Don and the head of the appropriate business unit.  There are some areas which will also be dual tasking for a period.

Louise,

Did you ultimately agree with legal that we would proceed with using the EEI as the GTC?

The GTC provided below is the EEI.

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.

Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
4:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
5:15		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
5:45		Credit				Bradford
6:15		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
6:45		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
7:15	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
			Infrastructure			Jenny Rub

		
Please make yourselves available - the meetings will take place in 2991

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc on John's card.

Tammie - please check availability.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks
 
Louise

Louise,

I only spent an hour on this.  However, I would pass.  This would keep a lot of orig/tech/finance people employed for a while in order to manage it and then work off the pieces.  

This looks like a fairly impressive private asset company - they appear to be good developers, acquirers, etc.  They even say that they that restructured 8 of their PPA's - presumably they restructured the ones that make sense - further reduces our restructuring proposition.  

To me, the QF optionality goes like this:  
- If you have a high-variable cost QF that operates as a baseload facility, the math works to shut it down or convert to a peaking PPA when the market is low.  
- If the market is high, you have an easy-to-develop expansion.

Problem is, their assets appear to have low variable costs (coal and new gas) so the restructuring play does not jump out at me
...and we are bearish on development

At PV18, this could look like a good diversified low risk business - superior to most of our regulated businesses and most of our international businesses, but I think it would be real tough to get returns >30%.  Besides, I think someone will pay more for it.  Over half the net MW is new 7FA capacity - attractive to Calpine and the Calpine wanabees.   This is actually a cheap way for an IPP to hit its MW growth targets without blowing their brains out in the spot market.  

Someone should pay up - not us.   

Question: Did we form qf teams in the east and west because of the success of East Coast Power?  Was that success largely driven by the fact that we bought it cheap?  Or did we innovatively restructure the PPA?  If we brought innovative financing to the deal, isn't that the same as buying it cheap?  Was East Coast Power a formal auction or was it a negotiated deal? 

I can dig into this some more if you'd like.  Our internal model would be my next step.  Let me know.

Regards,

Chris Calger

Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered ou=
t to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.

All agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.

I will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same.

Subject:=09IT & Back Office Service Agreements

Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office=
 Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the e=
state's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment onc=
e a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate=
.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these=
 services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser=
vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has n=
o way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enro=
n for everything from email, internet, network services and office applicat=
ions as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are c=
oncerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in =
Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastruc=
ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support =
services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy=
stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our =
Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support=
 their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications =
into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal w=
as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  =
Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it=
 may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges=
t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on =
the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro=
m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee=
n the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog=
ether a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

Subject:=09Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary



Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by =
Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books=
, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some co=
de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens=
ure the applications still talk to each other.=20
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio=
ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app=
lications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional perm=
utations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degr=
ee.=20
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin=
g their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise =
that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio=
n system level before the enterprise integration test starts.=20
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point).=20
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es=
tate and New Co.=20
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex=
ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to=
 support go live to production.=20
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve=
rsion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integrat=
ion Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too=
 tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility.=20
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co=
nversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical pa=
th for New Co.=20


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi=
ng first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down=
 dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and fina=
ncial on Jan 20.=20
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=
EP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=
 HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=
 to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=
e're in synch.=20
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=
icense of Unify.=20
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=
terparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=
ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=
g hard coded reference id risks.=20
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =
potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=
red to support day one trading.=20
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=
iderations. The time window will be very small.=20


Core Conversion Team =20
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen
6) Ken Harmon
7) John Warner
8) Bob Ward
....

2) Iain Greig

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Hi Louise,

Is this going to be the new name or is it a working name?  If it is the actual name, we can get the verisign registration done, and begin some graphics work.  Otherwise, I'll hold on that.

I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.

I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.

This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.

Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:

11/13/01	4,069:72
11/10/01	21,010:15
11/10/01	3,319:40

Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.

In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.

In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.

Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.

Subject:	RE: ibuyit or IT

Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.

Thanks

Louise

Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

Louise

I am getting zeros from everyone else on DealBench.  Have not heard from EES or EBS yet.

Pickering says you have a sheet showing 610 on IT last year (I assume expense and capital).  Mark says he is getting it from you tomorrow so I look forward to sitting down with him and seeing that vs. our estimated 720 for all of ENW in 2002, which includes all operations as well. 

I explained the complete expense and capital numbers across all the business units to Wes this morning.

I assume we are coming back to you next week on the EA systems project list, the actual headcount on IT and an answer on our indirects.  I will make sure.

Subject: DealBench in 2002


As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.

Can we discuss?

Thanks

It seems silly to have all of us going to dave as he is the only EES person attending

Invite Frank, Laura, Tycholiz, Lagrasta, Breslau, Duran, Forster, Calger, Foster, 

Just in case we haven't invited any of them.

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Did Montovano clarify things for you? Also, Roy Boston may give you a call. I know you may be skeptical( at best) of me at the moment, but I care as much as anyone about salvaging this company and its enormous talent and I also "get it" in terms of what's necessary to get there( the perception last week  that I was trying to hang on to an organization and organization structure that was obsolete is just dead wrong....I was trying to salvage as much of an organization that I and others are convinced has always produced bottom line value far in excess of its cost( unfortunately, I failed on this point with two of the most important people at Enron, you and John...and I'm talking before this "crisis" set in)...I do recognize the need for the cuts we're about to make. Hopefully, in time, I can regain the confidence of you and John. Thanks.

These are the events that took place concerning the New York Customer Holiday Event:

In order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in NY at the Four Seasons, I have to book no later than 9 months out.
To hold these rooms, a contract had to be signed and a $15,000 deposit sent.  The contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of July with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable.
In speaking with Dave Duran and Frank Vickers in May, they wanted to proceed with this event. ( Attached is a memo that I sent to Frank Vickers outlining the cancellation policy.)
The cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in July.
After the approval form was rejected, I spoke with Dave Duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re-submit the approval form.
I talked to both Frank and Dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until I received an e-mail on September 20th from Frank canceling his portion of the trip.
I called my Four Seasons national sales rep and she is working with NY in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages.  I should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail.
Thanks.

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.

5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?

Laura

Mary is working up all the options on severance and furloughs.  She will have all the data and legal perspectives whenever we need to push a botton if we button.

I think we are moving towards this concept.
Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES responsibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte. 

On the commercial side, I am thinking Beth.    I have had preliminary discussions with Beth and Mark on her moving over to our side to manage our requirements.  If you have a problem with this - let me know.  I have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome.  I think Beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on IT side.  Its a huge budget and we need someone really responsible for it.

On the operations side, I have asked Sally to take a large portion of the IT development budget into her budget as essentially its things like maintenance.

Sounds like we are thinking the same thing and we have made some progress towards this goal.

Subject:	Thoughts on Technology

It is a little bit funny and a little bit sad watching the technology group try to get buyoff from Louise and the business units on 2002 budgets.  It is unbelievable that we can't get a project-based capital and expense budget for next year where someone like me can say I signed up for these 5 projects and willing to do them at such and such a cost.  If the project costs more then I'm not interested.  While there is definitely room for improvement on the technology side, the commercial side has room for improvement as well.

We had a very useful EES Risk / Wholesale Risk technology meeting on Friday.  It was clear from that meeting that Commercial, Technology, and Operations are not on the same page.  East Wholesale and West Wholesale Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Commercial and ENA Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Marketing and EES Risk may not be on the same page.  Anthony and Beth aren't on the same page.  Sally Beck's organization is organized wholesale vs retail while (at least on the power side) the commercial and technology groups are heading towards organized along commodity lines.  

For fear of sounding too dramatic ... the success of EES as well as wholesale Services deals is a function of our technology and back office.  Without it we fail.  The cost numbers are huge.  It is a critical point of competitive advantage.

It was amazing, we had a room full of talented people at this meeting on Friday;  I believe what was standing between us and a successful technology development effort was organization.  We are completely disorganized right now.  There are very few specs that are currently written to support next year's projects.  We have a completely inefficient, decentralized process for working through this stuff.

I have some thoughts that I'd like to share.  It cuts across wholesale and retail.  I think that we need a lead from commercial, technology, and operations for power (and probably gas).  I think the commercial person needs to drive the process and ultimately sign off on spending money for projects.  I think that we need one technologist in charge of all power systems.  I think that we need to look at everyone we have and choose the right person -- not necessarily the people who are currently leading this effort, although Anthony and Beth could be leading contenders.  We need Sally Beck to look at her organization and make sure that it is aligned for maximum likelihood of success.

The goal of this is not to micromanage each business unit's technology needs.  It is to coordinate and optimize across groups.  We have to make sure that we don't spend money in wholesale and retail and then develop incompatible systems.

How do you guys want to talk through this?

We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):

0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals)
> 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction 
Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid)
Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000
Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes)
					Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes)
Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.)
On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)

Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.

Let the games begin!

Louise

Subject:	EnronOnline Budgeting Method

As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

9 am 		Introduction
9:15 am		Infrastructure						Rub
10 am		IT - Development & Ops				Webb
11 am 		Mid Office Intergation Overview			Hall	
12 noon		Accounting, cash etc Integration Overview		Colwell/Georges/Meyers

11am 		Tour of the building/infrastructure			Donovan

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

Everything has been somewhat confusing recently and I made a hasty decision to put you reporting through Legal (decision prompted by the community relations comment) - there will a dotted line into the desks.

I hope you are happy with this if not we can unwind but following many conversastions with them over the last few weeks - it really has been Lou Eber dealing with all the reg issues.  

I really believe that putting Reg in the legal area is the best choice to ensure your group doesn't fall down any cracks as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in  UBS.

Did you get your contract?

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side

Louise,

The consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the Power guys would like to have a full blown Master Agreement on EnronOnline instead of a simpler GTC.

Obviously, I can put either onto EnronOnline, but wanted to let you know before we do so.

If you want us to stick with a simple GTC, please let me know.

Thanks,

Dave

After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.

Just thought you would like to know.

I spoke with Parquet and Mcdonald re contracts and offered the following:

Parquet:
Base - $200 - no increase
Signing - $100
Equity - $250

Mcdonald:
Base - $175 - no increase
Signing - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet's is identical to what you offered; Mcdonald is significantly less than Parquet and right in between Parquet and Dyer (50/150).

Louise -

David Parquet is currently on an employment agreement which expires on 12/1/2001.  Chris would like to be proactive in signing Dave up again for another 2 years.  

Dave's current contract details are:

Base:		$200,000 (due to SF cost of living)
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/00
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/01

Chris is proposing:

Base:  		$215,000 (or $200,000 with a COLA payment of $15,000 for each year of term)
Signing: 	$100,000
Equity:		$350,000 (50/50)

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
Amy

We are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs, they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at Corp.  Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).  We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers.  

As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).  We are all over this one but progress is slow.

If you want more details - let us know.

Louise, 

The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll

Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  

We have two options:
1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.

Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.

Did you ever receive a refund check from ADT Security?

Expenses:
They have informed me your $5,000 payment was issued on 1/4/01 and it takes 10 business days to arrive.  It was mailed here so I will keep an eye out for it.  They also said all of you expense reports have been processed but they can not pay the remaining balances until they get approval from Enron.  I will keep on top of it.  Have you heard anything else about us getting paid our remaining balances?

Hi Louise,
 
it was good talking to you on my last day at Enron.  A couple of weeks have since past and I am now in Houston on a visitors visa.  Now I can focus on DealBench. I am currently spending 100% of my time searching  for funding of the venture. As you pointed out this solution would really be an  attractive one for both sides. 
 
The VC community is still under shock with the drop  in the NASDAQ and making contacts is best done through referrals. Do you know  anybody that is well connected in the VC community. I would be glad to meet with  that person and brief him on the venture and get going with the local Houston  venture firms.
 
Let me know if you have any other ideas that could  help the process.
 
Take care.
 
Tobias

There are still several traders I have not talked to.

Vince is still compiling his list for Research.

Central and West Logistics, east orig & trading, west gas orig, structuring and canada have not submitted.

Central and west gas trading is incomplete.

I have weather, fundies, arnold's group, fred's group, laura's group, gosset's, and all the apps.

Lloyd Will is handling all of power including Portland.

I will be out all next week but available on cell (412-4632).

I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.

Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.

Issues:

Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is  issuing 3 times in some cases.  Will this mean we order three by accident?
I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.  Please resend with descriptors.

Thanks

Louise

Hi Louise,

I asked each of my directs to consider 3 levels of cuts.  I told them this is strictly an exercise at this point and that we haven't been given targets (trying to keep the emotion down).  The three levels were:

 A. Remove capability for new projects but retain a reasonable ability to continue growth of our current application suite.

 B. Reduce to minimal development capability.  Retain ability for operations and minor enhancements to applications.

 C. Cut to life-support level.  Retain ability to operate the applications and fix bugs.

The cut levels are as follows:
A. Reduce by 11 (to 129)
B. Reduce by 21 (to 108)
C. Reduce by 17 (to 91)

Jeff Johnson placed himself in the A cuts, though I removed him from that cut thinking I can talk him out of it.  He is in the B cut.

Steve Stock placed himself in the B cuts.

Michael Guadarrama placed himself in the B cuts.  He said he would probably leave if the A cuts were made but would wait until we got through the transition.

Hopefully we can hold this together.

I'll try to call you to discuss.

Thanks.

Hi Tammie,

Nice to speak with you this afternoon.

As I mentioned, currently Sloane Apartments do not have a two
bedroom apartment available from January 1 - 5, however they feel
that it is likely that a cancellation may come in which would allow
them to accommodate Ms Nettleton.

In the meantime, they shall be pleased to reserve a one bedroom
suite plus an adjoining deluxe double bedroom at their sister
property Parkes Hotel in Knightsbridge.  The rate per night of
Slaone Apartments 2 bedroom apartment is GBP195 per night, and
although the rates at Parkes Hotel is considerably higher, they will
be pleased to reserve both the suite and double bedroom for the
same rate.

Parkes Hotel is located at 41 Beaufort Gardens, London SW3.
Below is a brief description plus I have attached a few pictures.
Could you please confirm that Ms Nettleton would be happy to
accept the suite and deluxe double bedroom at Parkes Hotel and
should a two bedroom apartment become available at Sloane
Apartments they will amend her reservation.

Comprisesof separate bedroom with double bed. Separate
    lounge with Sofa (sofabed on request at additional cost),
    armchairs, coffee table, desk with data port and extensive

    kitchen with fridge/freezer and combination oven, together with
    tea making facilities

Subject: RE: Trademarks for NewCo


After conversations with Kal Shah and Greg Piper, here is where we stand on the trade marks and domain names.
 
A.  Ownership of the following to be transferred to NewCo:
 
1.  Putting the energy into e-comerce
2.  One stop energy shop
3.  Pricedesk
4.  Pricedesk.com
5.  Retaildesk
6.  Retaildesk.com
7.  Trading Innovation
 
Note that there are trademark applications pending for 2 and 7 above, and 3-6 above are registered by Enron Europe.  The Sellers will agree to convey whatever rights they have in marks 2-7 above to NewCo but cannot guarantee that NewCo will ultimately own the marks.
 
B.  EnronOnline:  Seller will grant NewCo a limited license to use the EnronOnline trade mark and logo for a period running 6 months from the date of closing solely for the purpose of marketing the new site as a platform for wholesale gas and power trading in North America.
 
C.  EnronOnline.com/net/org:  Seller will agree to redirect from EOL to NewCo for 60 days after NewCo site is up and running (with a link back to EOL at the NewCo site) and for 120 days thereafter will provide a link on the EOL site to the NewCo site.  
 
D.  Enbank:  Kal proposed that NewCo own this mark, but Greg would prefer that the Estate retain this mark.
 
I will leave it to Tim and Greg to discuss this proposal from their end and then contact Kal and/or Dave Forster to discuss.  After you all have reached resolution, I would appreciate if both Greg and Kal could contact Roger Ross of Weil Gotshall (713/546-5018 or roger.ross@weil.com <mailto:roger.ross@weil.com>) directly to confirm the final disposition of marks and names. 
 
Please let Roger know who should receive drafts of the License Agreements relating to B and C above.  
 
Please do not hesitate to call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.

Leslie -- I have spoken to Dave Forster and we would like to update our request  from yesterday as follows.  Pls. forward this to Nancy Raber as well.
 
The ownership of the following mark should be transferred to NewCo.:
 
1.  Putting the energy into e-commerce:  Current Tagline for EnronOnline 

A one year usage license should be obtained for the following marks/domain names:
 
1.  EnronOnline:  Global Commodities Trading Platform 
2.  EnronOnline.com/net/org:  Global Commodities Trading Platform 
3.  Enbank:  Virtual Gas Storage Auction Product in Enron Europe
 
If possible, the ownership of following marks/domain names should be transferred to NewCo.  If it is too complicated/costly, you can leave this out.
 
1.  Electricitydesk 
2.  Electricitydesk.com 
3.  Energydesk 
4.  Energydesk.com 
5.  Gasdesk 
6.  Gasdesk.com

Nancy -- As per our conversation this evening, I am attaching the e-mail I had sent to Leslie Hansen.  I will contact Leslie  in the morning and determine what marks/domain names Enron will allow for inclusion in the deal.  I agree that if the new company is going to have a different name, it should be sufficient if Enron kept the EnronOnline marks/domain names, but allowed their use for certain period of time to the new company.  I also acknowledge your concern that granting use of the marks may be more complicated if they are owned by Enron Europe given that it's a separate entity.  We will need to work out this issue depending on which entity owns the marks.  I will work with Leslie to research this tomorrow.
 
With regard to the "nice to have" trademarks in the second list below, I know that most of the domain names are owned by Enron Europe, not Enron Corp.  I will research to see which entity owns the trademarks on them.  If the trademarks are owned by Enron Europe as well, we may forgo including them in the deal for now.
 
Please hold off any offers for trademarks/domain names your deal papers until I call to confirm our final position.  I plan to speak to Leslie and Dave Forster (head of EnronOnline) in the morning.  Thanks.

John and Louise,
 
I have taken John's draft and added a few thoughts, including the issue of what happens if there is not a new agreement with counterparty (the Enron agreement remains in effect), the possibility that the new entity may not hire everyone, and the concept that they transfer to the new entity upon closing.
 
Let me know your thoughts.
 
Michelle

In the budget numbers we had a headcount of 638.  I would like a list of all of those employees of Enron North America, with work numbers, home phone numbers, cell phones and pagers.

I would also like the same for EES wholesale.

It may be easy to do this by looking at the floor plans for the new buildings.

Louise,

I've seen a list where you nominate a set of business sponsors to represent NA interests, and it appears that the intention is to have single points of contact for each of the budget buckets.

However, there are a number of horizontal initiatives, such as Global Data, that cut across all of them.

Is it your intention that we take the horizontals to all the people listed, or will you nominate one to evaluate the budget numbers?

regards

Steve

Tammie - forward this message to Calger and Milly and Forster
 
Hello
 
I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.  
I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.
 
Thanks
 
Louise

Louise: 

We are making progress, but it is slow.  Below are listed the contracts or terms on which we need sign off from UBS Warburg.  I telephoned Brian Murtagh today and asked him to come down this week to Houston to help finalize all the forms by the end of the week.  He is coming on Thursday.  We also talked about getting sign off from tax and credit at the same time, so as not to delay things.  He is hopeful that no sign off will be required from Switzerland (re the bank netting issue) at least on an interim basis.

In regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first -- I need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that I believe you had prepared.  I think I need the top 50, the second 50 and so on.

I will be out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for my operations.  

Regards, 

Mark Haedicke

Hi Louise,
 
Here is how I would word it:
 
Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES resposibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte.
 
When I get to the big org announcement I'll have to add some more blurb in.....
 
I have a really good feeling about this combination. The way I want to take it forward is Steve, Anthony and I working closely on the strategy for EES and ENA.
 
On the subject of ENA IT Liaison, I had a discussion with Greg. We think that it would be better to have Beth completely out of the picture for the reasons I initially stated. An initial suggestion was that Jeff Richter might be a good fit, given his IT background and commercial understanding, although he'd have to move back from Portland. I think Barry Pearce would be great. Give me a few days and I'll see if I can come up with some other names, maybe someone from Europe ?
 
Best Regards

Information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to (i) confidentiality provisions with counterparties and (ii) with respect to power, the need for FERC approval .  Everyone seems to be comfortable that the identity of counterparties can be disclosed, as well as the counterparties contact information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular counterparty.  Consequently, the software going to Netco will  be cleansed of the trade data and individual's data bases and files should be similarly cleansed.

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?

Subject:	Remote Office Lease Payments

Louise, 
Enron Property has asked me to validate whether some of the remote office leases should be paid for January.  I have been unable to get an answer about the Denver office.  Will you please advise?

We will still be able to reject the lease even if we pay the January rent, if we do so by Feb. 2 under the bankruptcy rules.

Thank you, 
Tammy

Louise,

I know you are appropriately focused on the Netco sale, yet I had Tammie place me on your calendar for 4:30 p.m. today.  I want to discuss my withdrawal as a potential employee of Netco and my desire to remain with the Enron estate.  Consistent with my ongoing concerns regarding the Chicago office, I also want to ensure those employees remain with that business to preserve value to the estate.  They have done an amazing job on behalf of the joint venture and PEC has voiced their desire that they are retained on PEC's behalf, no matter the counterparty.

I wanted you to know my direction even if your schedule would not permit for our meeting today.

Thank you,

Laura

We have Restart/Integration draft plans in place for our business lines as defined below.  I have put the point person next to the function.  I have also attached an organization chart with phone numbers for each person.

The areas where we do need to quickly establish a process is that of the contracts (both customer and facilitation eg pipeline, pools etc) as we will need to move very swiftly in the implementation of contracts to speed re-start  ( I also attach the contracts which we will be entering into at the end of this note).  

Please let me know whether you would like a suite of the re-start plans, they are in the early stages but aim to be updated each day at the re-start meetings.

*Ski Pass- I have attached pricing on multi day tickets, you do not need a
passport photo.  It will simply have your name on it.  You may set up
individual accounts for each skier, or I can run them through our company

of each skier, skiing start date, and number of ski days.

*Snowmobile- I have reserved 7 people on 6 machines for the 3:00 pm Tigiwon

They are pursuing because I requested to pursue.   The reason for the e-mail is to place management emphasis on this opportunity.

Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.
 
John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward.

Subject: Conn. Coal Plants


As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

When people request an understanding of gas or power - does this mean you ask people from ENA to give tours or speak or something?  Is there any role we play in hosting the event?

Solarc is the system used for NGLs etc - we do not plan to convey it into NetCo.    In terms of the court case - the whole thing is stayed pending the bankruptcy.  They did try and prevent the whole NetCo thing but there is obviously no basis for any suit as we are not taking it.

Louise,

Attached is the list I have collected so far. Please let me know if this is what you need.

I think the attached substantiates two issues:

1) EES is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities (and they are being quite up-front about this)

2) EES is approaching industrials which fall within ENA SIC codes.

Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  


As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  

Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Pat O'Donnell (co-chair)
Mark Bridges 
Sally Beck  - Operations
Mark Haedicke - Legal
Wes Colwell - Financial Operations
Bill Bradford - Credit
David Port - Market Risk

Jenny Rub - Infrastructure
Peter Keohane - Canada
David Forster - ubswenergy.com 
UBS counterparties
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate.
Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Tim Belden
Chris Calger
John Lavorato
Kevin Presto
Hunter Shively
Rob Milnthorp
Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to do this yourself. This is my cheat sheet if it helps.  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Louise,

I believe what you are seeing is names of Enron Networks employees who are placing orders on behalf of ENA. When this happens these employees are responsible for obtaining prior approval for the responsible party within the cost center their are ordering for. Additionally all IT hardware purchases must be reviewed and approved by a technical buyer once the cost center financial approval is obtained. Therefore, some of the individuals which you see listed in the approver 1 and approver 2 columns will not be ENA employees. 

Please advise if you have any additional questions.

Thanks
John

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Louise

Subject:	The procedure


There are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a Password Application:

1) Direct knowledge of the individual signing. The energy community is relatively small. In most cases, we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past. 

2) Ostensible Authority.

3) 3rd Party Verification.

For 3rd Party Verification, the following procedure is used after Credit, Legal and Contracts departments have approved the Counterparty for online transactions:

?	The Main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the Trading Department is requested

?	A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded.

?	Date, Name, Title and Phone Number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places:  1) Access Tracking Database and 2) Online Trading Operations Control Form and 3) Recorded telephone conversation.

The Master User ID is forwarded to the customer only upon the verification of the authority of the applicant.

You have two problems

(i) Unwind of interest rate swap ($2.3mm)
(ii) Mismatch of money from swap versus interest rate swap. (approximately ($9mm) is not offset)

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks

Subject:        Re-start/Integration Planning 

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter

This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.

A great reflection on you guys too.

* * * * * 
Tuesday, Dec. 4 
I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
* * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me. 
Matt Hommel,

North American gas prices have increased recently, and power prices have followed.  The American Gas Association released storage numbers recently that appear low to our team.  Although these developments may create a difficult near-term environment, Enron Americas does not view the current strength in commodity prices to be sustainable.  
?	Enron Americas closed on the sale of 80%  [Kitchen, Louise]  of our  interest in a 240 MW power plant in Monterrey, Mexico, to Tractabel for approximately $40 million in cash and the assumption of all the related forward obligations by the buyer.

Following up on our discussion.......

Thank you for taking the lead to prep and set up a meeting(s) to get the appropriate team(s) prepared to testify on January 24, 2002.

I realize that there will be many different activities underway in the next couple of weeks, and we all include maintaining / maximizing the value of the CA book and the CPUC activities as critically important.

Well...

Due to calendar conflicts at Utilicorp, their President, Jim Miller and the Vice-President of the Utilicorp Utilities, Gail McMinn, will not be together and execute documents until next Monday, October 8.  The have an internal approval process similar to our DASH and they could not get all parties to execution by today.  

None of us like delays, but I remain extremely positive and assured on this transaction.

Louise, just not to leave this item pending.  You asked me to talk to Steve and think about a differen ttitle...After hours of deliberation, I propose to you that we keep the regular US title  (Director), and we avoid any confusion. In terms of our customers I'll just tell them I am director for the Monterrey office.
Let me know if you are OK so I can immediately correct my business cards. 
Thanks and have agood weekend.

Subject:	Management Conference - Business Unit Panel


Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

Louise, 
Enron Property has asked me to validate whether some of the remote office leases should be paid for January.  I have been unable to get an answer about the Denver office.  Will you please advise?

We will still be able to reject the lease even if we pay the January rent, if we do so by Feb. 2 under the bankruptcy rules.

Thank you, 
Tammy

Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. 
Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. 
Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)

Liz,

	I work for Anthony Dayao as part of the EES IT group but formerly was in Enron Net Works under Steve Stock and met Louise briefly in 1999.  I'm in the middle of the Rice University Executive MBA program and for one of our final exam questions, we are permitted to consult internal resources.  The question is regarding how we (Enron)  have used the Internet to differentiate ourselves from other organizations (Competitors) in the industry.  During our Rice MBA classes, EOL was brought up several times so it's considered very highly by the school.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention its strengths during our exam.

	My professor has provided me assurance in writing (Email) that any answer will not be published.

	I appreciate Louise' and your time in helping me on this school exam paper.

	Regards,
	David Zaccour

Exam Question:

2.	Working with whomever you deem is appropriate in your organization, identify the three organizations in your industry, which in your opinion, use the Internet and World Wide Web the best.

If your organization is not one of the top three, what does it need to do on the Internet and World Wide Web to move to the "best" category? If your organization is among the top three organizations in your industry, what uses of the Internet and World Wide Web have differentiated your organization from other organizations in your industry?

Louise,

Thanks so much for your speedy reply. I will pass your comments on to Dave Walker in Media Relations.

I included Kevin because he is listed with you, Greg and John on a "management" slide. If there are others who should be
included on Greg's core management team for the announcement, please let me know who they are and their titles. Please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include Kevin. If there is an org chart, that might be helpful, too. It would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long.

Thanks again,

Claudia

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

(See attached file: UBSW Energy release draft.doc)
On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed
that sentence.
(See attached file: UBSenergycomreleasedraft.doc)
Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a
particular reason?

Thanks

Louise

   Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing
   the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
   transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The
   plan is to issue the closing announcement on
   Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for
   when the website officially launches, which is
   expected on Monday (2/11).

   Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media
   Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

   Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for
   Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
   global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the
   new management. I need from Human Resources
   confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In
   addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
   Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with
   Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
   posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There
   will also be internal publicity on the day the
   website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and
   intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
   integration site.

   Please let me know if you have questions.

   Thanks,

   Claudia

Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest. 

With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  

Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

John & Louise --
 
See the note below from our outside FERC counsel.  We are targeting meeting with FERC Staff in DC on Thursday Jan 17.  Still aiming to also meet either Thur or the following Fri with Commissioners offices.
 
Sam indicates that FERC General Counsel viewed expediting our application poorly for fear of appearing partial.  As important, Sam indicates that Netco may need to make concessions (in what form and manner not sure) to appease staff to not hold up our application beyond 60 days.
 
As soon as you know the winning bidder, we will begin finalizing the FERC filing.
 
Thanks.

         Sarah - As you and others requested, I called Cindy Marlette, Acting General Counsel at FERC, to set up a meeting re the FERC filing for NETCO.   She has set up a meeting for 10 a.m. on the 17th, with the Staff.  We talked a little bit of substance.  She was curious as to what actually was being transferrred, and knew nothing about the atructure or substance of the deal.  When I raised the subject of asking for expedition, she indicated that significant expedition was unlikely, because the Commission "didn't want to give the appearance of partiality."   I told her I understood, but that we didn't want to become the test case for the SMA standard or do anything else that would take us beyond sixty days. She understood that.    Given the ciurcumstances, I think 30 days is the very minum we can get, and that something around 60 days is more likely.   If we get our signals crossed with Staff, it could be later.

Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.

Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.

In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.
  
Thanks

Louise

Louise,

You may want to send a note to your commercial team to channel all new customer requests through Dave Forster and me.  I would like to be copied to make sure Dave has a clue as to what are real priorities.  Once we get up and running and the volume drops, I would be happy to coordinate this effort.

Louise,

I understand that you will shortly receive a first draft budget submission for ENA. I'm not sure what format you'll receive it in, but if its the standard format, it'll be difficult to pick out the project level estimates.

I have access to the team/project level estimates, and would be happy to pull together a quick view that suits you.

I was going to try to guess how you would like to see it, but I thought I'd better ask you first, ....it'll probably save me a lot of work! :) The thought was to give you a quick handle on whats "essential-keep the business running" stuff, and what would be great but we can struggle on without.

Please remember this is supposed to be a quick heads-up, and not intended to replace any full explanation that will innevitably follow later.

Some alternatives (obviously, feel free to suggest your own)

1.
Capital
	Team
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

2.
Capital
	Team								% Essential	% Nice to Have
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $			40%		60%
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $			80%		20%
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

Please let me know what you would prefer, and I'll try to get you the view by the end of the day.

regards

Steve

This in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until April.  All of these would be IT applications support.  I would feel comfortable naming names, so if you think you have 5 temporary spots for these people and need names, I will get them to you.

I think it would be a great idea if we could get a few extra spaces for
IT support in the new building.

We would need five spots.

Two for Enpower (one for risk, and one for volume mangement and confirms)
Two for Unify (one for logistics and one for EDI)
One for Gas Risk

I won't make requests for specific personnel (yet)  just not the most junior
personnel. 


Let me know if you need anything else.

Louise, 

The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll

Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  

We have two options:
1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.

Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.

Subject:	Draft Governance

Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  


As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  

Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Pat O'Donnell (co-chair)
Mark Bridges 
Sally Beck  - Operations
Mark Haedicke - Legal
Wes Colwell - Financial Operations
Bill Bradford - Credit
David Port - Market Risk
Jay Webb - IT
Jenny Rub - Infrastructure
Peter Keohane - Canada
David Forster - ubswenergy.com 
UBS counterparties
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate.
Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Tim Belden
Chris Calger
John Lavorato
Kevin Presto
Hunter Shively
Rob Milnthorp
Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required.
?Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.

Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.

3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee 
This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.

Proposed Sub-Committee Members:

I am sort of hoping you know about the deadline for start up plans - I know yours is slightly different but something needs to be done by tomorrow.

Subject:	Re-start/Integration Planning

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers

Pat

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

Hope this helps.

Louise

As per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now I would suggest one on one with Eber as it has be3en the only succesful route3 to date.  Can you give him a ring with Steffes today and get this stuff moving.

Steffes is looking for some direction on getting FERC license and pool agreements.  Among other things, he needs the go ahead from UBS and legal to start an application process for UBS while he is still employed by Enron.  When you have a moment, I might suggest a meeting with key legal, reg and commercial people so we know what we can do and when.  This is also relevant to transmission agreements and ultimately to customer agreements.

Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=
on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "=
informal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=
, moved from a "hold" to a "sell" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=
he company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.=20

To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=

ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=

The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=
f disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlike=

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America

Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "W=
ho knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their app=
roach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do."

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=
ow about the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=
ef financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder eq=
uity. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for detai=
ls.=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad=
 news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compa=
ny's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term f=
ortunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=
y's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's l=
owered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow Wednesd=

Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets group, as CFO beca=
use "it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require=
 us to replace Andy," Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said.
Fastow will take a leave of absence.=20
Shares of Enron, based in Houston, have plunged 80% this year. Third-quarte=
r charges of $1.01 billion from failed investments outside the main commodi=
ties trading business wiped out 70% of the profit earned in the last four q=

"Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to Andy," said J.P. M=
organ analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded Enron to "long-term buy" and ow=

Fastow, 39, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two partnerships created=
 by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's involvement in the financing vehic=
les cost the company $35 million in third-quarter losses.=20
Enron also bought back 62 million shares from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billio=
n to unwind its investment.=20
During a conference call Tuesday, Lay said, "I and Enron's board of directo=
rs continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy and think he's=
 doing an outstanding job as CFO."=20

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it cr=

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Thanks

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively "a cost of capital" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

Please confirm that ENA will not bear any insurance costs for the HPL assets for the second half of 2001 and the balance of years going forward?  If this is not the case, then we need to meet and discuss why this is not the case.

In addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.

As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

Do the innocuouss route and send them a letter stating you will change it at the next available/scheduled GTC change would be my suggestion.

Also just to confirm no GTC  changes on anything for the near future.

Subject: RE: GTC Change for removal of HPL language


Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name "Houston Pipe Line Company" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark "HPL".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty "re-accept" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other "cleanup" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to "make it worth their while"..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either "do nothing" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the "innocuous notice" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the "notification route", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

Louise,

Attached is the original email from Dave Delainey and John Lavorato. In my opinion, utilities and municipalities do not fall within the EES target market of being "less energy intensive and less sophisticated in their management of energy" (see below). Neither would aggregators fall into this category.

I am also concerned about the principle of EES approaching utilities to encourage them to act as an EES sales agent. I believe this ultimately results in little more than aggregation of load into wholesale levels - and in any case, results in multiple representatives from Enron pitching products which achieve similar results from the customer's perspective.

In addition, providing EES load management solutions may jeopordize other ENA projects which require that load (services deals, plant construction, etc. in addition to the usual wholesale product suite). I am concerned about the risk (however slight) posed by the EES activity as ENA actively tries to develop relationships with these customers and to close substantial wholesale transactions.

I'll wait for your thoughts on Monday before I go to EES with these concerns.

Thanks,

Dave

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact.

sorry missing the message

When are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as I am not prepared to write down a 23mm loss.

Payments and payment dates please.

Thanks

Louise

Please say not soon too.

Subject:	Longview DASH Request

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

Reagan, Bill, Larry, and I got together to put together a draft business plan that can be applied to the Southeast and Midwest regions.  The schedule is probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  The plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and until we know VAR, capital, etc.

Sarah provided the list to Louise last week - it was a report run by Comp from SAP.  The following people were on the list and showing as withdrawn.
 
Deidre McAffrey 
Larry J Hunter
Larry G Cash
Jon R Lewis
 
In reviewing the information this morning, Deidre and Larry Hunter are showing as terminated effective 12/6/01.  It appears that we have the wrong Jon Lewis on the NETCO list - it should be Jon P (known as JP) Lewis.  JP is still showing active and we will have Kari Oquinn update the NETCO list to reflect the right employee.  With regards to Larry G Cash, today he is showing as active - the action must have been reversed last week as when the report was pulled, he was showing as withdrawn.
 
Please advise the status of Larry Hunter as he appears to be the only one still in question.
 
Kind regards -
Amy

Subsequently, I've asked HR reps to notify me of any resignations as they happen. Haven't had any news today although Robert tells me 11 resigned from estate today.

Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.

Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
4:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
5:15		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
5:45		Credit				Bradford
6:15		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
6:45		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
7:15	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
			Infrastructure			Jenny Rub

		
Please make yourselves available - the meetings will take place in 2991

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc on John's card.

Tammie - please check availability.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

Louise

Hi there,

I wanted to ask you guys, if you know of any jobs that Nicki Daw could do, she would like to stay in Houston for a while longer,  I know she won't ask you herself as she did leave on the 31st December, but if we can get her a job maybe her employment could be reinstated and last week could be vacation.  If you know of anyone looking for a brillant assistant or someone needing some to coordinate a project, please put in a word. Nicki is in the office today and will be in Houston for about three more weeks.

Thanks

Sue

In case you hear - Wayne Mays' son had an anthrax scare (white powder in back pack).  Hazardous Materials unit and FBI went to the school.  Most certainly a hoax, but FBI suggested they may come to our office.  Although highly unlikely they come here, we alerted local building security and Enron Corp. security just so they are aware.

This is their headcount estimate.  Initially, the risk and logistics responsibilities can be shared by 1 person.  

It is my understanding that they run on the same ERMS/TAG systems.  They still run their phys on TAG rather than SITARA which I think could continue.

John,


This is our estimate of the support staff requirements for the NGL business.

Risk Book:	1 full time
Logistics:	1 full time

Legal:		shared personel,  I dont see the need for a full time legal person dedicated to NGLs

Credit:		1 full time (at least initially), as we ramp up the business we will need a lot of credit support getting counterparties set up and approved.

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. 
The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. 
Transportation 
The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. 
Video 
You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).
Please find attached the following information: 
(i) Attendees and Teams for Video 
(ii) Draft Agenda 
Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) 
We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek. 
John & Louise

This seems to be the best way of getting on top of all the meetings.  Let's discuss.

Subject:	Draft Governance

Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  


As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  

Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Pat O'Donnell (co-chair)
Mark Bridges 
Sally Beck  - Operations
Mark Haedicke - Legal
Wes Colwell - Financial Operations
Bill Bradford - Credit
David Port - Market Risk
Jay Webb - IT
Jenny Rub - Infrastructure
Peter Keohane - Canada
David Forster - ubswenergy.com 
UBS counterparties
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate.
Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Tim Belden
Chris Calger
John Lavorato
Kevin Presto
Hunter Shively
Rob Milnthorp
Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required.
?Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.

Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.

3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee 
This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.

Proposed Sub-Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)

Time Tuesday 8:00am CST

3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee

Please review the resume and let me know if you see a possible fit within your worlds or know of anyone else that might be interested in him as I need to update Ken Lay within a week on his status.

I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me.

Louise, Attached please find our ERCOT business plan for your review.  Doug and I have jointly put together a trading/marketing detailed plan to get ERCOT restarted as quickly as possible.  We have separated the plan in three tiers to prioritize tasks and customers in order to expedite earnings for early 2002.  

One thing you should note is that in ERCOT we will not need a FERC power marketing license to start trading physical power due to Texas not being regulated by FERC.  Therefore if there is a drag on obtaining the FERC license, ERCOT should be in the lead for regions getting restarted.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks, - Mike

If you have an issue you need to ring Eric Gonzales.

He shouldn't have had the meeting - there is a lack of integrity on this.

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

Louise: 

We are making progress, but it is slow.  Below are listed the contracts or terms on which we need sign off from UBS Warburg.  I telephoned Brian Murtagh today and asked him to come down this week to Houston to help finalize all the forms by the end of the week.  He is coming on Thursday.  We also talked about getting sign off from tax and credit at the same time, so as not to delay things.  He is hopeful that no sign off will be required from Switzerland (re the bank netting issue) at least on an interim basis.

In regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first -- I need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that I believe you had prepared.  I think I need the top 50, the second 50 and so on.

I will be out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for my operations.  

Regards, 

Mark Haedicke

Subject:	Duke Meeting - Pluto Line
Importance:	High


I met with Stephen Noe over lunch yesterday to discuss the sale of the Pluto Gathering line.  As per our internal meeting on Wednesday, I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation based upon the data provided thus far.  Enron has provided Duke with the Gathering Agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream.  I informed Stephen that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering  line.  We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream.

Stephen informed me that Duke's evaluation to date showed a value in the $14 to 15 MM range.  Stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation.  However, based upon the notional value Duke has derived,  it appears that Duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor Enron is using.  I stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value.

Based upon this discussion with Duke, I would recommend that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get Marathon approval for release of the Production Handing Agreement (PHA). I will contact Richard Clark regarding the PHA.

If you have any questions please give me a call at ext. 33541.


Thanks  ... Kevin

Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.  Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and John on resignations.  SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.  

Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and me.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.  

Thanks.  --Sally

Canada appears to be an issue.

We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.

There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.

Please let me know how we can progress on this.

Louise,

IT needs source code and documentation for all Exotica library functions. In addition, we need the Excel add-in build environment for building the exotica DLL and its help functionality. We need documentation for all models used by traders and risk managers. Naveen has a list of those models. My group can help maintain those models and the exotica library and provide IT expertise. I will help get a complete list of models used. Following is the list of Exotica functions.

Thanks

The tickets will have expired but you should be able to get a refund on the return portion them.  Here's what Ayscough have said:-

Having spoken to Continental in London, they say that Houston may not
entertain a refund or reissue, but London would certainly action a refund
only back to the original card. If they need assistance get them to forward
documents direct to us.

Good idea to prepare a list - we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all.

But definitely put a list together.

Louise, there are several universal issues that span the entire gas origination business.  I would like to put together a list of discussion topics for dinner to make sure that we table those items which are of most importance.  However, you may want the discussion to be more free flow.  If I pull together the topics it will be a list from all regions not just my own.  Would you prefer to take this in another direction or should I prepare the list ?

Sorry only just got to read this.

Louise,

Three questions/issues which I'd appreciate your feedback on:

1) I am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators/traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers (sending draft PA's) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers.

2) After some more thought, I'm on the fence about sending out the PA's without names. The following occurs to me:
	- Sending them out on Tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be
	- Sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility
	- The PA/ETA is a very simple form; customers probably don't require the extra three days to review them.
	- Following the public release of our new Buyers' identity with the first release of the PA helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise.

3) I understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers' name to another company. I don't think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later. Can we keep this in?

Thanks,

Dave

Hi Louise,

Just got off the phone with Gail. She wants to know if they can help by coming up with a guaranteed offering from IBM that would help any NewCo succeed by providing IT support/direction, saving money, monetizing assets, retaining key staff and lending the IBM name, etc, etc to the deal.

If you're interested you can either call me or call her directly.

The only comment  on the structures transaction slide is that 

(i) They are not from this quarter 
(ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.
(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.
(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.

Subject:	Americas 3Q Presentation

Please find the latest draft of the Wholesale pitch included below as an attachment.

I have included front portion, Americas and Europe sections.

The only data point I am lacking at this point relates to our East Power slide regarding #  of Term MW's.  I am working with Leslie Reeves on obtaining this information.  I expect the wording on the RTO's slide may change a bit once Gov. Affairs provides their final comments; however, this draft includes most of the content.

Following our discussion this morning, you may have some comments on Slide 14 (Recent Structured Transactions).  This slide was modeled after your Board presentation.  We can add/delete information as you desire.  

I am working on modifying the conference call script language and will forward to you shortly.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards.

Greg, Mark and I met with the Estate this morning and Canada did come up in terms of the Transistional Services agreement.  Could you let us see Kyle's request and we'll try and help from this end.  How many people is he asking for to be seconded to the Estate.  I am concerned over IT requirements as we never developed this software in the first place - it was created by Razorfish.

In terms of 5, the person dealing with this is actually Per Dyrvik who is going to set up a conference call for us this morning.

Peter - tried to ring you. Give me a call when you are free.

So here's my question.  Is there any possibility that we will be not doing the standard bonusses (which have caused huge problems in the US in the last years) at the end of this or next year.

I need to know whether to budget the bonus numbers/aa allocations for 2002.

If you haven't thought of this please do as I really do not think its appropriate to go with the nightmare from last year.

I would like to add Nick Hiemstra (manager) to the SE orig team.  He's currently in the estate group.  He previously worked for Jim Meyn running power structuring for the SE.
 
I don't know the mechanics of moving someone from the estate to the Netco, but he would be a great addition.  I plan to include him on my org chart portion.  Please let me know otherwise.

(i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  

        The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     
(ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                                To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 
(iii)   Seating Plans                                                           Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. 

Happy New Year 

Louise

Please let me know if this is what you need.

Brian,

Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the Texas Origination count from 12 to 6.  The attached file shows the positions that were initially submitted.  If you will let me know what to eliminate, I will make the necessary changes.

Subject:	FW: UBS Warburg Energy - First Priority Trading Agreements


The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.

Subject:=09Security Update


Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks
 
Louise

Nothing but good news everyday. Not sure I mentioned this: kerrigan's now running non-reg finance side at txu in dallas. We started talking about possibility of txu resetting eastern contract and writing us a big check (discount for early pay to be negotiated based on size). No word yet from legal on rolling el paso - ecp swaps back into ena and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting el paso.

The enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product, by counterparty, for a number of liquid gas products.  Each column represents the life-to-date position generated on that product, for that customer, through the date in the heading of the column.  

I don't see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions.  

If I can put this into a more convenient form, let me know what would help.

Thanks!

Louise -

We've negotiated an MOU with Alstom that has helped us fix the purchase price for CFB based power plants.  It does not commit us to spend any money today; it's really just a strong guideline for what the EPC will look like.

Having said that, Alstom considers it a BIG deal, and they are flying in some heavies from Paris for the signing ceremony.  The guy below is the lead person from Paris.  Additionally, Fritz Gautschi, Alstom's Country President will be coming.

Bottom line:  It's tentatively scheduled for the morning of 17 October here in Houston.  If you and Dave are available, I'll coordinate.  You won't need to sign, just provide some presence.  There's still some flexibility if that day doesn't work for you.

Thanks,

Mitch

Louise,

As you know, for our NetcoOnline relaunch, we will need the following from UBS ASAP:

1) PA and ETA approval
2) Agreement on new company name ("Netco" replacement) and new online system name ("NetcoOnline" replacement)
3) Approval of Press Release

I assume all of these are underway. Please let me know if there is anyone at UBS whom you would like me to chase.

Thanks,

Dave

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.  I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Our differences are:
Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster
You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin
 
I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.
 
Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey? 
 
I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Speak to you later.

You will only be charged what it takes to support EA's primary business.

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Thanks

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers

Current costs.  In these plans we have expensed software and hardware which we will probably amortize.  Gets us around the $200mm mark.

Not sure - I can't plan that far ahead at the moment.  We are just in the final stages of getting the part of the business I work for sold and therefore out of bankruptcy - I work for a company called Enron which has gone bankrupt.  We have just sold the trading piece to UBS so we are in the process of transfer and I have no idea what the new bosses will be like.

Are you going?

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business
for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

  NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001--
  

  Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
  Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers
  

  Though Hewlett-Packard lost $75 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly
Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the
No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business.

  The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of
FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00
p.m. on October 1.  

  In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that
actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in
revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds
the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort
and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and,
last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list)
to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine
startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has
breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in
the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern,
Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in
April.  

  In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward.
In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is
a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior
writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies
the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building
influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider
knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."  

  Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural
list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year)
run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall
Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but
Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are
the subject of great scrutiny," she says.  

  As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year,
power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was
fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who
pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen
Hancock, who failed at her startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker,
who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior
looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never
overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target
profits every single quarter.  

  Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO,
Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO,
Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne
Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena
Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman,
EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper
Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie
Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black,
President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail
Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems,
Raytheon.  

  While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to
evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and
importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her
company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely
to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture
and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list."
The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one
trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than
ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost
automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE
50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20
billion or more, which is a first.  

  In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at
Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women
want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most
successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she
has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it
advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has
done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving
her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins.

  In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women
in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino,
CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma,
Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia
(Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong);
Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit
(Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina
Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President &
CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at
www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

Subject:	IT Infrastructure plan

Kim mentioned that you're on the phone. Jenny designated the Disaster Recovery piece ($10M) and some other items as Capital Expenses, and we neglected to include this in our schedule. The total capital budget is $14.7M. I presume that you'll want to include this amount? 

What we currently have is expense plan of 24.9M with a 1.2 multiple equals 30.2m.

I think we'll want to amend it :

24.9M 	expense
14.7M	capital

39.6M	total (would you still want a multiple to increase to 47.5M?)

We have a call in for En Ops as well to make sure that there isn't any potential capital plan we might need to include.

Please let me know!

Brad,

I had a conversation with Wally Turbeville from VMAC at around 11 AM. From his conversations with the main players in the industry he got feedback that "they are very enthousiastic about negotiating a deal that would free cash for Enron" (his words). He offered his support to negotiate with the industry players and wants to set up a meeting sometimes this week.

1) Do you know if NetCo is going to have similar arrangements in Canada to what we had before bankruptcy? (e.g. trader in Houston trades Eastern Canada on behalf of ENA, but trader in Calgary trades Western Canada on behalf of ECC)

2) Looks like we might have to prepay 1 month to preserve Reuters content. I'm assuming this is no big deal, as we will still be month-to-month and can cancel.

Louise --

I need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transferred from Enron to UBS.  If any of the data is viewed by FERC as being jurisdictional assets, than Enron would need to inform FERC of that transfer before the transfer.  Clearly, customer specific data will create more issues than generic market information.  I need to check what happens if you have deleted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data.
 
Who can help me get a better handle on this on Monday?
 
Also, I understand the "adoption" by UBS of Enron contracts.  Initially I was under the impression that this was simply a "review".  Again, any transfer of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by Enron.  I have seen one draft of the Interim Agreement, but assume that you would do this for EEI and other physical contracts.  Am I right?
 
Thanks,
 
Jim

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

Not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory.

We know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities? We need names etc.

Split the list into areas

Industrials in our SIC codes

Utilities

Munis

Louise,

Attached is the list I have collected so far. Please let me know if this is what you need.

I think the attached substantiates two issues:

1) EES is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities (and they are being quite up-front about this)

2) EES is approaching industrials which fall within ENA SIC codes.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.

Sorry its all prepetition.

I already claimed the flights, now I will not be using them as I can not go home.  I am using the money to pay for my parents's flights although not all of the money will be used.  The rest of the money I intend to offset against expense checks which bounced.    Should there be an imbalance - I will sort this out with Enron once payments have been completed on expense checks.

OK?

I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me.

Louise,

I understand that you will shortly receive a first draft budget submission for ENA. I'm not sure what format you'll receive it in, but if its the standard format, it'll be difficult to pick out the project level estimates.

I have access to the team/project level estimates, and would be happy to pull together a quick view that suits you.

I was going to try to guess how you would like to see it, but I thought I'd better ask you first, ....it'll probably save me a lot of work! :) The thought was to give you a quick handle on whats "essential-keep the business running" stuff, and what would be great but we can struggle on without.

Please remember this is supposed to be a quick heads-up, and not intended to replace any full explanation that will innevitably follow later.

Some alternatives (obviously, feel free to suggest your own)

1.
Capital
	Team
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

2.
Capital
	Team								% Essential	% Nice to Have
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $			40%		60%
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $			80%		20%
Expense
		Project 1 Name		Description	ENA $		
		Project 2 Name		Description	ENA $

Please let me know what you would prefer, and I'll try to get you the view by the end of the day.

regards

Steve

Subject:	Origination to be granted to EdeM

Louise, we have been pre-paying the positions to some of our customers. Some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the Pemex Fixed Price contract, and then re-purchasing the swaps. In some cases they are asking to get pre-paid, so we call treasury and calculate the NPV with the discoutn rate they give us ( Usually Enron's Cost of Funds).
However, I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases, so that we offer a better alternative to the customer, than their own cost of funds.  It has worked and I think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that.
Questions:  Can we get credit for the origination on top of Enron's treasury rate ?  If so, with whom should I speak to get it granted to EdeM ?

Best regards.

Ok - this isn't dying.  I understand all the usual problems but I am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis.  West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.  Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?  Can we help?

Subject:	RE: Credit

Both of these below trades are trades that Credit should have approved.  

However, our exposure with IP is over $21mm and we don't have a signed ISDA contract.  I think the analyst (Darren Vanek) was trying to get the attention of Craig Breslau to make it a priority to get the document finalized.  This is an ongoing discussion with Craig and we are seeing little progress.  I can't believe this would have an impact on our relationship with the customer.

The USX trade should have been approved but Darren was probably swayed by our position on an EIM prepay transaction with US Steel where we are requiring the risk to be pre-syndicated.

Darren is a young aggressive analyst which I believe is doing a good job trying to support Fred's team but with more experience will learn where to be more flexible.  

Fred's team likes to push the envelope on Credit. In isolation we will probably be okay but in the context of the growing portfolio of deals it will be increasingly harder to manage our risks.

I think this issue has already been resolved.  Let me know if you would like to discuss.
Bill

All of a sudden (and without prompting - before you ask) I am hearing a lot of noise surrounding Jay Williams and Darren Vanek (?) including a couple of transactions (small but big customers - like International Paper) where the customer is getting very upset as we have refused to do one month deals with them.  Also USX felt the same and we are persuing deals with them too.  Can you look into this for me?  It may be OK but it might be a little over zealous.


Noise from East Gas and Lagrasta's groups

There is an open issue with respect to how the URL address will be positioned between the estate and NETCO.  It was my understanding that we wanted it retained at the estate with a pointer to NETCO, and a window box back to EOL.  Please call John Casaucoumeq (with whom I understand you will be speaking tomorrow at some time) (212 723 9661) and determine with him how this is to work.  Citi lawyer said however you and he work it out will be satisfactory as it is a business issue.  Please let Anne and I know.  Thanks.  Mary

Would you mind doing the following
1.  Ring Teresa at Jaegar and ask if she can get me another plum top (sleeveless)
2. Could you check on my appointment at Manos y Mas that I have a standing appointment every two weeks. 9:00am every second Saturday with Michelle.  I would like to have a pedicure every 4 weeks at the samr time as my manicure.  So I have an appointment every two weeks going forward for amanicure and a pedicure every 4 weeks.  The pedicure needs to be with someone else so its at the same time.
3.  Could you start working on the Trip to the uk at xMas. I need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to Kings Cross to get a train or go all the way home.  
Depends on price.  Kelly Ferrari will have the name od ac chauffeur company.
I also need the name of some apartments in London to stay in from Jill Whitehead - could you try ringing her - she has a web address.

I am not expecting any of this today, but its nice to have things to look forward to.

Thanks

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks 

Louise

Subject:        Re-start/Integration Planning 

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter 

Target Number of Transactions 
+       Phase 1 
+       Phase 2 
+       Phase 3 

IT transfer

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

9 am 		Introduction
9:15 am		Infrastructure						Rub
10 am		IT - Development & Ops				Webb
11 am 		Mid Office Intergation Overview			Hall	
12 noon		Accounting, cash etc Integration Overview		Colwell/Georges/Meyers

11am 		Tour of the building/infrastructure			Donovan

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

50% or less of the current group.   We have a market of 1 year = $x, so we'll need more cash for less people.   We may need our spare cash to fund the $12mm for the back office etc.

Deborah and Janelle,

Mr. Fallon has asked for an estimated per person cost for moves:

1) within a building
2) between the Enron Centers

He also assured me that questions regarding conflicts between the estate and NETCO operating out of the same building had been addressed, thus there should be no problem with EWS consolidating on ECS 3&4 in the near term.

I also spoke with Rich DiMichele regarding the EBS move.  As we discussed, he obviously does not want to move EBS twice within ECN.  He is interested in bringing EBS over to ECS if wholesale will be here for any length of time.  Again, cost is obviously a concern, so the per person cost estimates you provide should facilitate this decision.  We can discuss this further at tomorrow's meeting.

Please provide me with copies of the marked up maps for ECS 3&4 as soon as possible so I can begin considering our options.  

Thanks,

Kevin

I saw that our Friday meeting got rescheduled until next week, after your budget meeting with OOC.  I'd be interested to know what number you'll be assuming from EOL in those discussions.  I got your email, by the way... we're putting a little more thought into it than that.

Also, Amita is going to accept a project job with UK power.  She needs an answer by Friday on her and her husband's jobs.  Having not spoken to any other candidates but her at this point, I can't commit that soon.  We'll keep in touch with her on the off chance that her power job is short term and she still wants to come to Houston.

Louise,

Here's what we've got. This list of MTM values is based on a list of prepay deals #'s from Greg Whiting and shows value as of COB 22 Nov 01.

Global Finance has the rest of the details we need to complete the picture. 

Give me a call if you need more.

Subject:	Marketing Issues

Louise,

1) I just received a call from Pat O'Donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the Top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from UBS corporate marketing folks, instructing us not to use the url: www.ubswenergy.com. It seems they want us to use www.ubswarburg.com/energy. Pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy.com tomorrow. He anticipates having resolution by noon. I personally don't care much what URL we use: the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important. Of course, a change in URL now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again. . .

2) UBS (in the form of Matt Meinel, who feels Mike Hutchins will be in agreement with him) do not want us to redirect traffic from www.enrononline.com to the new site, as they feel that promotes too much of an association with Enron. I disagree with their position, but don't think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name. Also, the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement.

Please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed. We are ready to put the Splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow, but these 11th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and I feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name.

Dave

Life is pretty difficult at the moment.  It astonishes me that we (a trading company) were brought down by a rogue finance shop and some bad investments.

We are trying to sell the trading company (North America) in which Marcus and I work.  There are plenty of bidders in town but it is a pretty horrid time - working 10 weeks straight mostly through the nights and as you would expect no-one appreciates it!  I am really missing time with Scott.

Anyway hopefully better news coming.

Hope you are all well.

Take care all three of you

Louise (and Marcus and Scott)

Louise,

I was doing a last pass through these documents, when I noticed that the last sentence of the 2nd to last paragraph contains something similar to what you had removed from the ETA: "UBS may give Counterparty's name to potential product providers as a prospective counterparty". This wording was changed in the PA in Sept. so was not redlined in the changes you and I reviewed earlier.

I'm OK with this staying in. Please let me know if you want it removed.

Dave

Please review the attached PA and ETA. These are the final versions of the documents that we plan on using. The PA might go out to the top 50 customer as early as this afternoon. We are preparing the UBSWenergy 'splash page' and will upload this version of the ETA unless otherwise advised.
The entity is officially named UBS AG, London branch (collectively "UBS") and the Website is UBSWenergy.com. If you are not in agreement with this, please advise ASAP.
I encourage everyone to read both of these documents very carefully. I have looked them over several times and everything looks to be in order but your 'fresh' review is appreciated.
Thanks.

Louise,


Chris and I would like to provide additional equity to three members of our middle market team:  Chris Foster, Stewart Rosman, Paul Choi

As you know, compensation for Middle Marketers in Portland has become very competitive recently.  We lost Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs in Q3 to AEP simply because AEP was willing to pay a lot more.  Chris, Stewart, and Paul all signed two-year contracts at the end of 2000.  In short, they were unlucky enough to sign contracts at the worst possible time.  The market for their services, both inside Enron and outside of Enron has gone up.  The equity that they received as compensation for a non-compete is worthless.  In addition, they received no signing bonus.

Chris and I compared their contracts  to the ones that started getting rolled out in April and ones recently signed with people in similar positions in Portland.

				Title		Mid-Year Rank		Signing		Options		Stock

Mike Etringer		Dir	 	2			$40K		$75K		$0
Jim Gilbert			Dir		2			$50K		$100K		$0 
Chris Foster			VP		2			$0		$50k		$0
Stewart Rosman		Dir		2			$0		$50k		$0
Paul Choi			Dir		2			$0		$40k		$0


Here is our proposal for equity grants to our three key people in middle market / services.  This is just no strings attached equity because it's the right thing to do!  These guys are going to be key to our success 

			Restricted		Options
Foster		$50k			$75k
Choi		$50k			$75k
Rosman		$50k			$75k



Let us know your thoughts.

Tim
(on behalf of Tim and Chris)

Subject:	A few questions for you
Importance:	High

Hi Louise

Hope all is well and that your trip to and from London went smoothly!

A few questions:
1.	Does Enron have a system which collects data by customer?  We
have something called CMIS which we use for these purposes and which I
believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don't
have something already.  We usually need customer info for reg
reporting purposes.

2.	Bob Dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of
sorts whereat the heads of Gas and Power Trading present to key UBSW
people what their businesses are all about, example trade flows,
competitive pressures, key reg reporting requirements, etc.  He would
also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what
they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets.  The
thought is to try and do this on Thursday because so many UBSW people
will be on the ground in Houston for the simulation exercise.  I don't
know that I am wedded to that day and I am a bit unsure about whether
this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration
but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and I
am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this
once they start trading.  What do you think?

The audience would include key logistics personnel from UBSW and Enron
and anyone else you thought appropriate.  Spoke with Mike about it and
he is fine.

3.	Having UBSW paraphenalia sent down - toys, shirts, etc., should
be arriving by no later than Tuesday.  If you haven't received anything
by late on Monday could you let me know so I can track down.  UBSW and
UBSW Energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both
trading floors - they should arrive by Wed.

4.	Was thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor
on Friday to commemorate the closing.  What do you think?

5.	I am planning to be down in Houston for most of next week.  I
thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to
address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on Friday.  I
will be leaving on a late Monday flight and returning on a late
afternoon Friday flight.  I hope you think this will be useful.  Please
let me know otherwise.

Sorry for the long message.  Please feel free to call me at home or on
my cell if you have any questions, issues, would like to discuss H 914
764 4597  C 917 523 6132.

Jean is still pushing to run wellhead desk, she may come and see you.  I have pushed back stating that we are much better placed to evaluate her outsourcing business as it is and that we will review this when we have seen sime dealflow.

Louise,

I think what I really wanted to convey is the following:

1. John Grass originally headed up the Wellhead desk and Outsourcing efforts for the producer segment.  I wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services.

2. When the volume of the Wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of "contract focus" with Ocean Energy, Andex, and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued, I asked Kevin Miller to manage Producer Outsourcing and John Grass to manage only the Wellhead desk.

3. Based on Kevin Miller's memo (attached below), the Wellhead desk reporting into Hunter, I have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the Wellhead desk.

Regards, Mrha

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

I am intending to start getting brokers signed up as soon as we know our new company name and have the PA and ETA forms authorised.

Do you think we need explicit buyer authorisation before we start signing up brokers?

Subject:	UBS Contract Changes - The Process

Just discussed this with Collette and UBS HR. Suggestion is we proceed as follows:

Any suggested change must be agreed by one of you on the Enron side (including support)
If you agree, we will capture the proposed changes on the attached form and fax it to UBS team.
If the change is simply a reallocation of dollars, as anticipated within the pool, they will generate a new contract.
If the change is incremental to the pool, or otherwise significant, Collette has arranged a time on Sat, Sun and Mon to call Hutch. If he agrees she will authorise the UBS team to produce the amended form.
I anticipate suggested changes to the document text and titles. These we will also capture on above form and fax to UBS for discussion.

I don't think I do  - I thought Elizabeth said she would use a reference document - not the EEI.

Louise,

Did you ultimately agree with legal that we would proceed with using the EEI as the GTC?

The GTC provided below is the EEI.

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

Good point - assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want. 

Obviously we shouldn't bother with bridgeline, peoples or anything like that.

Will that work?

I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments.
 
Clearly at this point Enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer.  That would be a Don Miller/Fallon final call - but I think its a no brainer.

Under commitments to PEC, Enron has commited to provide office, computers, trading systems, etc.  If this is changing, I need to know quickly.  I have been provided indications from several outside counterparties, some divisions within Newco and I thought Netco as holding interest in purchasing the Chicago business.  Due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with PEC, I believe it imperative that the business/office be operational until March, 2002, at a minimum.
 
Please advise.

Laura, 
I understand that the Metals group has asked to keep the Chicago office open until Mar 31 to wind things down.  Do you have any new information on ENA's Chicago folks at this time?  We may ask for a 60 day extension under bankruptcy orders to terminate the lease.  

Thanks,

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary 
Portland 
San Francisco 
Chicago 
Denver 

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Tammy

I heard about the videos at your offsite and I'm hoping people will take your lead.  VHS shot on someone's Sony will be great!  Innovision has also agreed to work with any team to simply provide editing services for them.

As for the $10,000 figure ... I was concerned that if "outsourcing" wasn't an option, we wouldn't get many entries.  But the cheaper the better -- there will be recognition given to the best "independently produced" video.

Thanks for your input and I hope Enron Americas will have a submission.

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

We have resolved the issue partly.  John now reports directly to Hunter.  Give me a ring to discuss.  I felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed, quite rightly so I think we have solved most of the problem.

Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.

Thanks

Louise

Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

 For all you guys who had dealings with Structure ...

---------------------- Forwarded by Sean Dodd/EPETL/EASTERN on 11/01/2002 09:39
---------------------------

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

Big Pig:

Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?  


UBS:

Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI.

Piper is incorrect in the sense there is no decision on who owns the code or licence yet.

Talk with richter and louise together if possible. Initially newco would only get an exclusive license for gas and power and not the code but I think creditors should have options so brad is still looking at determining eol value outside of a newco deal.

Louise,

Can I have Tori's network profile scanned at some point?  She resigned at the end of last week.  Just concerned about her downloading fundamentals because she starts immediately with RWE this week.

Thanks,
Mike

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

9 am 		Introduction
9:15 am		Infrastructure						Rub
10 am		IT - Development & Ops				Webb
11 am 		Mid Office Intergation Overview			Hall	
12 noon		Accounting, cash etc Integration Overview		Colwell/Georges/Meyers

11am 		Tour of the building/infrastructure			Donovan

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

It may tie but what is the difference - I think the uneven margining in Mahonia 9 is costing us a lot.

I'm not worried about the actual number just the imbalance in margin which hasn;'t come back to us

On mahonia margining, I spoke with mike garberding. Tells me he went through all collateral issues on these deals with wendi lebrocq in credit last week and everything tied exactly. He will walk tanya rohauer through the exact same steps tomorrow. Eric boyt is pulling deal numbers and details to match to documents.

I am confused - in terms of the options exercised - we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely I do not have a copy of here.   I am concerned I am double paying tax on these.  Can  you check last years's US tax return which covered those options.
 
I am contatable on 07778757656.

Has anyone given any thought to the potential Enron NYSE delisting date relative to the date when the NETCo deal might be announced?

I think there might be some "spin" implications.

The meeting is to try and get portland back in line on timings - we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month.  I am scared by his approach of 120 days for interconnection and 60 for FERC.

As per my email from yesterday;
 
Attached are Pipeline companies, Transmission Company (Ercot) and Canadian companies not on the prior "Louise Approved" list which credit has been working on.
 
We have been having difficulty tracking down the full legal name for some of the storage and transmission companies, and for AEC storage, there are two names - I assume only one may be required. For any cases where the full legal name cannot be found today, we have included the group name. We will resolve the remaining full legal names on Monday morning, when other staff are available.

With respect to prosecuting our business method patent application outside the U.S., we may now designate those non-U.S. countries in which we are seeking patent protection, or elect to postpone that process for an additional ten months.
 
If we wish to designate the appropriate countries now, we must file an application in each country in which we want patent protection on or before February 28, 2002.   If we elect to postpone the process, we must file an notice to that effect on or before January 30, 2002.  One benefit of taking the ten-month extension of the process is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will review our patent application and issue a non-binding written opinion on whether our invention meets certain conditions (novelty, inventiveness, industrial applicability) that are required in order to be patentable.  
 
Please let me know whether we should designate countries now, or file for the extension.  It may be that we want to let the dust settle on the NETCO transaction before making this decision.

No real choice - apparently there was an issue with visas so Jay told them they could say no.

Let's revisit Wednesday.

Louise,

- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?

- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

Dave

Good point - assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want. 

Obviously we shouldn't bother with bridgeline, peoples or anything like that.

Will that work?

John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999.

Sorry to mess you around on this but we have now booked the flights and we do not need the extra night - is it ok to cancel the extra night.  If possible could you please send a new confirm when you have time.

Thanks

Louise

I will check on the extra night and let you know.  I am in receipt of your
deposit check and am holding it pending closing of the property tomorrow.  I
will send you a confirmation next week reflecting the payment and the extra

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Louise

As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meeting. My assistant is away so its just a  misunderstanding.   See yesterday's note, we are going in on Monday.

I think losing Amita is a  major error.  There are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita.  

Thanks

Louise

I saw that our Friday meeting got rescheduled until next week, after your budget meeting with OOC.  I'd be interested to know what number you'll be assuming from EOL in those discussions.  I got your email, by the way... we're putting a little more thought into it than that.

Also, Amita is going to accept a project job with UK power.  She needs an answer by Friday on her and her husband's jobs.  Having not spoken to any other candidates but her at this point, I can't commit that soon.  We'll keep in touch with her on the off chance that her power job is short term and she still wants to come to Houston.

Subject:	Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

Please let me know if this is what you need.

Brian,

Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the Texas Origination count from 12 to 6.  The attached file shows the positions that were initially submitted.  If you will let me know what to eliminate, I will make the necessary changes.

Who can I work with to get the first names of the individuals listed for Gas Trading, as well as the split between structuring/fundamentals/trading? (I see some of the latter in the name column, is that the entire group? it would be helpful to have them grouped separately.) In a lot of cases there are several listing for some names, and they appear to be IT people. We're building a plan based on title, so that's why I need this info. Thanks!

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

We are at 196.5 Bcfs, and Origination of $4.3 MIllion.  We don't have "mini-books" to calculate our mark to market, but we'll have it ready this morning for you. 
By the way, we closed a Financial Zinc Deal, with Galvak (Alfa Group), in which we made around $75k. The customer bought a fixed price and a tunnel, for a total of 45,600 tons. We negotiated it with Enron Metals (London Group), and it was back - to - backed with ENA.

Subject:	HPL in 2002

Louise:

Some guidance on how you want to handle the ongoing HPL costs/reserve management for next year.  Specifically, there will be a number of items that roll into next year that will have to be managed. I am going with the assumption that Jim will report into Wes and will be responsible for supporting this effort.  

Question:  Do you want me to assume: (i) that I have a seperate cost center for HPL and that has Jim's cost allocated to it, or (ii) should this whole effort just role up to Wes and then I can support it on an as needed basis? 

I'm open to either, but my recommendation is to keep some commercial oversight over the settlement of the outstanding HPL issues.  Because, if things start coming unglued, I'm sure I will get dragged back into it anyway.

Regards,
Brian

Just when you thought it was safe............................

We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.

All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).

As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.

Thanks

The enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product, by counterparty, for a number of liquid gas products.  Each column represents the life-to-date position generated on that product, for that customer, through the date in the heading of the column.  

I don't see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions.  

If I can put this into a more convenient form, let me know what would help.

Tammy

Let's get together for 5 mins on Monday

In general:

Commercial and Energy Ops on 6.

5 would be all the support functions apart from energy ops.

Also we need a resort of the commercial teams

Can you let me have a couple of blank sheets again.

Thanks

Louise

Subject:	Draft 6th floor layout

Attached is the first draft of the 6th floor plan.  If you are fundamentally in agreement with the locations of these groups, we'll ask department leads to put final names on seats.  

 << File: 6th floorplan 01.04.xls >> 


The 5th floor would accomodate IT, Accounting and Energy Op's (excluding logistics/scheduling).

Phase one will include moving estate people off the floors - best case Tues/Weds pm.
Phase two will include moving the people already on these floors to new locations - best case Weds/Thurs.
Phase three will include moving people from the Enron North building over - best case to be determined. 

Regards,
Tammy

Here is a start on the list.  We have a meeting with UBS in the AM to review as well.  Obviously, I am putting limits that we would be willing to extend from a Credit Perspective only.  Taking into account liquidity and commercial drivers may adjust these numbers.  Let me know if you would like to discuss.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Louise

Attached is the customer priority list.

This is intended to be the "pre-approved" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power.

I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well.

Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them.

I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power)

Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no small part, to the great people I share this place with. 

I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family, but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Therefore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have decided not accept the offer. 

Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday. 

Best regards, 
Paul

Greetings & Salutations!

I received a phone call from an agent with Martha Turner who had seen
your house when it was listed.  He has a client who cannot find what
they want on the market and asked if you were interested in selling.

I checked as thoroughly with him  as I could making sure it was not some
sort of bottom feeder looking for an Enron 'fire sale' and told him that
you had spent large sums of money renovating.

He says they are looking up to the low $2 millions.

I let him know I was not optomistic about it, but I would check with
you.

Hope all is well and you're surviving all of the garbage.

John Marr

Subject:	Origination to be granted to EdeM

Louise, we have been pre-paying the positions to some of our customers. Some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the Pemex Fixed Price contract, and then re-purchasing the swaps. In some cases they are asking to get pre-paid, so we call treasury and calculate the NPV with the discoutn rate they give us ( Usually Enron's Cost of Funds).
However, I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases, so that we offer a better alternative to the customer, than their own cost of funds.  It has worked and I think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that.
Questions:  Can we get credit for the origination on top of Enron's treasury rate ?  If so, with whom should I speak to get it granted to EdeM ?

Best regards.

I definitely had a black mat last time.

I would like a black mat again.  In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.

So Ellie, this is what you want with a black mat.  

MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
orders)
FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
      Freight $250.00  

Fay, please co-ordinate with Ellie.

Thanks for your help

Good afternoon Louise

Thanks for your email.  I have outlined some costs below for you.

MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
orders)
FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
Louise, you have mentioned a black mount - the mounts are the board that the
image is adhered to and is not visible.  Do you mean a black mat.  Your last
image was mounted with a cream mat, however in this instance I would use a
mist mat as cream would perhaps be a little yellow for this image.  Mist is
not as yellow.  There will always be a small black border between the image
and the mount.
Freight $250.00  - you will be happy to notice that the rates for shipping
have decreased a little.

Total cost $1366.45.

Louise, I hope the above information is helpful and if there is anything
else I can assist with please let me know.  I look forward to hearing from
you with your final decision.

Cheers
Fay

Louise, I think that Laura has already passed this along but I do not want to assume anything.  Chuck Davario is leaving on vacation Wednesday of this week.  We have tentatively scheduled a meeting that would include you, the latter part of the week of October 22.  Probably on the 24th, 25th or 26th.  I know that this will need to be coordinated with your meeting with Peoples. 

In the interim, I have met with ENA Power/Asset management. We are preparing a list identifying every KeySpan activity and responsible representative.  ALL activity WILL be coordinated through me and will be focused to support this transaction.  I am attempting to schedule a meeting this week with Ed Anderson ( KeySpan, works for Chuck ) to complete an earlier Settlement negotiation.  We will continue to hold conversations with others at KeySpan during Chuck's vacation to keep all of the initiatives moving forward.  I will keep you posted.

Louise,
 
Colin came in this morning, spent some time with the Gas team, HR and then with me, and has decided he doesn't want to come back.
 
He intends to go back to UK in Q2 and intends to chill out untill then, do some travelling etc....
 
We had a long conversation about this, and it was evident that his mind is pretty much made up.
 
He was very flattered about being asked to stay on and he wanted me to pass thanks to you for thinking of him, and is sorry to have to let you down by not accepting....
 
regards

Subject:	NETCO Structuring Re-Start Plan

Louise et al

We have began the following initiatives to have a structuring function ready for operation within NETCO as well as other related issues to be addressed:

Structuring Model Capabilities - We are moving all of the existing gas and power structuring models into a directory to be transferred to NETCO at the appropriate time. We will need to provide the estate with formal documentation (from yourself and/or Jim Fallon) for the transfer of these assets into NETCO (per Vince Kaminski's request). These models have historically been property of the Research Group. We have initiated the process of transferring the ownership of this to a designated IT person within the NETCO organization.(See attached for more detail)
Deal Processes/Controls - Once Legal/Credit formalize the contract forms we will be using for NETCO, we should discuss a deal approval process to implement. I would assume the old ENA process would be the template we would follow with adjustments to be made for new corporate structure/ownership, appropriate approval levels of transactions,etc. Issue - Will there be a RAC-like group to provide overall deal documentation? I'm sure this issue will be addressed as transactions start to hit the radar and the collective owners of NETCO will sign off on a control process.
Back Office Execution Capability - Once the structuring models and the risk systems have been formally moved to the new IT enviroment, we will begin testing the models to the risk books to ensure valuation accuracy. We may want to talk about the reporting mechanisms from both the risk system and structuring models to include Cash Flow reporting tools in addition to MTM reporting. This may be a useful tool to front-end manage our cash position/exposure.

I've also attached a table with details of the above initiatives and estimated timelines. 

Please call me with questions.

Subject:	Re-start/Integration Planning

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

9 am 		Introduction
9:15 am		Infrastructure						Rub
10 am		IT - Development & Ops				Webb
11 am 		Mid Office Intergation Overview			Hall	
12 noon		Accounting, cash etc Integration Overview		Colwell/Georges/Meyers

11am 		Tour of the building/infrastructure			Donovan

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

He's on the Executive Impact & Influence course on 6th & 7th November and Marcello being Marcello has been a bit tardy in selecting his raters (well, I actually ended up doing once he'd told me who to pick!).

The thing is because he's picked the minimum no. of raters it's important that those few give the feedback on him - yep you've guessed it, you're one of the few.

Apparently the feedback needs to be done by Tuesday so please may I ask you to do your best to give feedback on him.

Thank you and I hope you & the family are all well

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

3 & 4 are better than where we are now.  The important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture.
 
The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.  But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building.

Subject: Real estate issues re: UBSW Energy, LLC in Houston




Hello Pat, Louise, Dave

The UBSW real estate department is reviewing the current/future lease

terms for UBSW Energy LLC, in Houston.  According to Brian Dugan, our

lead real estate guy on the bank side, the building owner has offered

a nine month lease to stay in the South Tower on the 5th and 6th

floors.  After the nine months we will be offered the option to sign

up for an additional 18 months but we could be moved down to floors 3

and 4.  Is this a significant issue?  I understand that the 3rd and

4th floor foot prints are similar to 5/6.

If UBSW Energy is willing to relocate to the North Tower, they can

get a lease for 5-9 years but this tower may be less suitable.  What

are the issues here?

The integration real estate team plans to meet this afternoon with

the Bank's outside legal firm we use for real estate issues.  We have

a target date of this Friday to try to resolve all real estate issues

in order to meet the DAY 0 legal integration date of 2/6/02.

Your thoughts please.

Mark

Janet,

Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have removed the split from East to West.

Load

Power
ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand

Gas 
ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day

I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value.

This is their headcount estimate.  Initially, the risk and logistics responsibilities can be shared by 1 person.

Legal:		shared personel,  I dont see the need for a full time legal person dedicated to NGLs

Credit:		1 full time (at least initially), as we ramp up the business we will need a lot of credit support getting counterparties set up and approved.

I think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.

Subject: Headcount Latitude



Louise, given the number of declines, is there any latitude in moving up the Canadian Headcount. I believe we cut very deep on the 1st go round. Specifically, there is  a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the non-commercial side we'd like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones (Admins are roughly U.S. $15K/annum and ours are extremely good). We still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities, but I would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses.

Thanks for the note.  We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.  We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed. Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.

Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.

I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.

If all else fails - I'll ring you on how to get my book published.

Take care & I will keep in touch.

Louise

Dear Louise . . .

I am so very, very sad for Enron.  It must be quite heart-breaking for
you--you made such an amazing contribution to the company!!  I am sure
there are many who must still be scratching their heads and trying to
figure out just what happened.  I don't know what your short-term plans
are, but I wanted to let you know that I'm very keen to stay in touch.
You are an extraordinary woman and I'm hoping that our paths will cross
again at some point.  Perhaps you would be good enough to keep me
informed of your e-mail address, should it change, and of your plans.

All the best in whatever comes next.

Gary.

You might want to ring Port - he wants the same numbers as Bill Bradford - so double what he has now.
There is a lot of disclosure around and so he thinks after he had bad treatment in the bonusses - the same is happening now.

His number is 281 292 1469.

Many of the desks on 5 & 6 have items in/on them that need to be boxed up and labeled and put in storage. We need to have them cleaned up prior to moving new people to these locations ASAP.

Can you please help identify a task force?

John L. suggested I pass of this request to you.  

As you work a deal for NewCo I wanted to make sure that we include the various tools we use in structuring for pricing and evaluating deals (i.e., we want to make sure the NewCo will have the exclusive rights to this information).  Kelli has provided a basic list of this information below.  Most relates to the exotica functions (and any associated code) that Research has created for structuring deals.  I am forwarding a copy of this to Jim Meyn to see if he has any additional needs.

Thanks.

Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.

Take care

Louise

Happy New Year Louise.   Hope things are going okay down in Houston with the bidding process for NetCo. etc., and that you were able to take some holiday.   I want to thank you again for facilitating my transfer back to Canada.  I was really enjoying working in the Toronto office; the people are impressive and the opportunity in the Ontario market is definitely massive and exciting.  

For now, I'm going to be working on the 'estate' side of things for Enron Canada, but meanwhile, I've also started investigating some interesting opportunities outside (i.e. retail opportunities, online platforms, etc.). 

Anyway, per below, are you okay with ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK getting transferred over to Centrica ?

Please let me know when you get a chance.  All the London IT guys that were dealing with this appear to be gone, so I'll follow up as appropriate. 

Thanks, 
Paul

Centrica are not connected to TXU (aka Eastern Group) to my knowledge. At least as of October when I left London, they were competitors in the marketplace.

Mark (and Mark) - Happy New Year, I hope you are doing well.   Could one of you get back to Josh Bourne at Register.com about this?  Register.com has been helping us manage our corporate suite of domain names.  My assumption is that provided the acquisition of Enron Direct (UK) by Centrica plc has been finalized, we should allow the domain name transfer to occur (though only for ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK as opposed to ENRONDIRECT.CA, ENRONDIRECT.COM, or other Enron Direct URLs). Will leave it to you to decide next steps...

Thanks,
Paul

Dear Friends,

I realize that some of you may no longer be at Enron.  I am very sorry about
what has happened and wish you all the best for a pleasant and productive
2002.  I need to make you aware of a situation that makes me very nervous.

We have been contacted by Nominet, the Registry for .UK domains.  Nominet
has asked us to free the domain ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK and allow it to transfer
away to a third party: Centrica Plc

Please advise whether we should follow these instructions at your earliest
(most urgent) opportunity.

Furthermore, if you have a moment, call me in order to sort out some open
domain matters.

Best regards,
Josh

Cris

Bit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.

We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high. 

Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

I do not think it is possible to begin selling the ATS Warrants at this time.

Per the ATS Warrant Certificate, the ATS Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants may not be sold, transferred or otherwise traded until March 20,2002.  The Warrants are also non-transferable except to an affiliate. 

In addition, the ATS Warrants are valued daily using a Black-Scholes model.  The spreadsheet with the result of the evaluation is attached.  The current value of the Warrants is $762,600 USD using the evaluation model.  However, the current ATS stock price on the Canadian Venture Exchange is $0.97C with an Warrant exercise price of $0.85C for the first 2,000,000 share tranche. The second 1,000,000 share tranche has an exercise price of $1.10C.  Thus, the current value is considerably less than the Black-Scholes evaluation model is calculating.  

 

If you have any questions please give me a call at extension 33541.

Kevin Miller

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic  arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.  

Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond continues to respectively run the West Gas and the Texas Gas Origination Groups. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject:	ECP/Linden Swaps

Here's my understanding of what has happened with the interest rate swaps:

As I indicated earlier, the original $32mm was put on for the Linden 6 expansion which never occurred.
The second swap of $350mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from El Paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly. This hedge does appear to have been set with the El Paso payment stream in mind.
The original $32mm of swaps DID NOT provide a clean hedge to the remaining El Paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the El Paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer.
However, the $382mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged.

It appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time, a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the "dirty" interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time.
Given that the monetization never occurred, it does appear to me that the $32mm hedge is ineffective and should be removed or replaced if we determine that we should hedge the rate risk associated with the note.

Anyone have anything additional to add? That's the best I could turn up looking back after the fact given the many personnel departures.

Hi Tammie,

Nice to speak with you this afternoon.

As I mentioned, currently Sloane Apartments do not have a two
bedroom apartment available from January 1 - 5, however they feel
that it is likely that a cancellation may come in which would allow
them to accommodate Ms Nettleton.

In the meantime, they shall be pleased to reserve a one bedroom
suite plus an adjoining deluxe double bedroom at their sister
property Parkes Hotel in Knightsbridge.  The rate per night of
Slaone Apartments 2 bedroom apartment is GBP195 per night, and
although the rates at Parkes Hotel is considerably higher, they will
be pleased to reserve both the suite and double bedroom for the
same rate.

Parkes Hotel is located at 41 Beaufort Gardens, London SW3.
Below is a brief description plus I have attached a few pictures.
Could you please confirm that Ms Nettleton would be happy to
accept the suite and deluxe double bedroom at Parkes Hotel and
should a two bedroom apartment become available at Sloane
Apartments they will amend her reservation.

The One Bedroom Suite Parkes Hotel has:-

Comprisesof separate bedroom with double bed. Separate
    lounge with Sofa (sofabed on request at additional cost),
    armchairs, coffee table, desk with data port and extensive
    personal bar. Has a full bathroom with shower. Also has small
    kitchen with fridge/freezer and combination oven, together with
    tea making facilities
Can combine with either Deluxe Double or Junior suite
Approximatedimensions 46sq.m

Parkes Hotel has the ideal location. Only 100 metres from Harrods
and within walking distance of many of London's exclusive shops
and restaurants. Heathrow is a mere 30 - 40 minutes away. Let us
arrange a limousine and enjoy the trip in comfort.=0F

Tammie

They know you are picking up the tickets - you will need a photo id too. You need to be in your seats 30 minutes before the show - get a cocktail to take in - I recommend the 'O'.  You probably should pick up your tickets at an earlier time than the show as the queues are horrible  just before showtime.

I'm trying to get approval for the portion of my 2002 budget that is currently allocated to EA.  Currently my budget estimates that 25% will be allocated to ENA for mainly the projects listed below in my original message to Geoff.  .  Another 25% is allocated to EES to cover my groups efforts in coordinating their move to Wholesale systems.  The remaining 50% stays within Networks to cover commercial deals like HPL etc.  Most of the ENA projects that I work on are in Brians world with a small part of my time spent on coordinating projects in Calgary and EDI projects for gas nominations.  Who do I need to discuss this with?

Geoff:  I understand that I need to get with you to approve the portion of my budget that is allocated the Enron America's.  Currently  $  299,871 is budgeted for allocation to EA.  My group coordinates JV activities as well as conducting due diligence on IT areas related to aquisitions and divestitures.  The amount budgeted above is for the following known projects:

		Coordination and Operations under the Bridgeline IT Services Agreement
		Due Diligence related to Project Sugarcane and how we may monetize our investment in Bridgeline

In 2002 ENA will bill Bridgeline $1,250,000 for IT Services.  Since Chevron/Texaco covers 60% of the bill ENA will net $750,000 in revenue for the services coordinated by my group.  

Let me know if you'd like to get together and discuss this in any detail.

Subject:	Option on Employment Contract

Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process.  I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute.  I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.

I am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven't received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure. 

It is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren't for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with "it's safe," "don't worry about it," "all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate," "low probability that there will be any issues," ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.

When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  
Because the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.
Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue!
Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.
Because we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.
Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.


Since I am not "on the team" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people "on the team" versus not "on the team."  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.

Furthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.

To be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:
the deal as it exists plus
retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.
indemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.

I expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.

In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  

Finally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.

Tim

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

(ii)  Peoples:  Can I sweep the $10mm to Enron and agree to put it back with a gty? Can we put the $40mm back to Peoples if necessary? What is the prepay - they possibly prepay us?    
Others I've got.

Thanks.

(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month
	Probability:	50%
	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

(iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)

Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.

Ummm. Don't see an issue with expenses, although I'm sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc., Everyone I've spoken too has a domestic relo program and Citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now.

1. Buyer will likely require netco to use their form of isda and related contracts.  We won't know winner and form of contract until monday.  Earliest we could trade would be next friday.  Is 4 or 5 days enpugh to make platform changes for EoL and related systems?

2 I just learned that under the DIP documents that became effective last monday we cannot execute any new trades except in connection with liquidating old book.  St.clair is running this down for your benefit and clarification.

3.  Alberta ppa was sold?  When is closing?  Depending on canada bankruptcy ruling in next day, we may be able to access these funds to help support newco ops.  Needs furtther investigation.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  Total Headcount at 874 and Total Bonus $s at 13,019,750 
Couple of things to note:
 Based on Zufferli sheet, I added 11 names to the Canada number but could not split btwn trading and orig
Probably need to verify Canda number with Milnthorpe.  I noticed Disturnal was not on the list.  Is that an error?
Did not see tax listed on Master cover sheet.  Tax would result in an add of 4 headcount and $220,000.
Portland had several changes adds in blue  

Please call with any questions.

On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
11:00		Credit				Bradford
11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
12:30		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
1pm		 Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub
2:00pm		HR				Oxley
		
Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32.

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc.

Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people.


Thanks

This spreadsheet has life-to-date transaction counts for all counterparties for North American Gas and Power.  There are separate tabs for gas and power.   The top 50 in each case are highlighted.  Legal entitites are rolled up where it seemed appropriate (for instance, there are about 10 Aquila entities which are rolled up to a single Aquila count).

No - this is a serious problem

FERC is just a month and probably will be expediated to less than that.  I want all the transmission and pool agreements to start much earlier - what is the problem with starting the negotiation now.

We really cannot accept these timescales - we have always assumed one month and all of this stuff is in place.

I'll be on the phone call  - let me know times/numbers	

Tammie - get Liz Sager to attend

One final new year's email: the netco startup plan for power is assuming 45-60 days to get a FERC license, 60-120 days to get transmission and pool agreements, etc so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer.  Presto, belden, sager, nicholai and I are meeting 9:30 wednesday to discuss.  Hillis set up a room if you would like to attend.

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

No concerns. We managed to get about $40mm reduction the IT development budget, you are picking up some of the reduced budget (See Lloyd Will's email of earlier today).  Let Lloyd know if you have any problems as we are getting fairly close to sign off.

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

Shawn
 
We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks
 
Louise

This amused me this morning!

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.
 
I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.
 
Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list.

Maybe 1.  But in this market we need to have the people who can make over 100 MM every year.  just thinking.

I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.  I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Our differences are:
Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster
You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin
 
I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.
 
Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey? 
 
I added to your file schoolyard.

Just a quick FYI;

If we end up doing deal with Umbrella, our review of their benefits package seems to indicate it will cost many of employees significantly more for the same level of medical and dental coverage, as much as $5000 pa.

I plan to raise this with John Donnelly and see if we can negotiate a softer landing for people, but I wanted you to know that this will cause quite a stir if we proceed without any pay rises or special subsidy for the rank and file.

Hi everyone

This is the regular review of all Enron SFA registered representatives who are currently based outside the UK or who are not directly employed by Enron.  I would be grateful if you could simply respond in the affirmative to this message, in order for me to maintain your current registered status.  If you have moved house in the past four months, I would also appreciate receiving this information.  

I would appreciate a quick response as, in the event that I receive no response from you by 22 October, steps will be taken to withdraw your individual registration.  

Thanks for your attention
Best regards
Julie

Seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty - this changes the function of EnronOnline to a margin exchange mechanism.  Long run not a short term solution.

Subject:	VMAC Transaction 

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this,

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

We are at 196.5 Bcfs, and Origination of $4.3 MIllion.  We don't have "mini-books" to calculate our mark to market, but we'll have it ready this morning for you. 
By the way, we closed a Financial Zinc Deal, with Galvak (Alfa Group), in which we made around $75k. The customer bought a fixed price and a tunnel, for a total of 45,600 tons. We negotiated it with Enron Metals (London Group), and it was back - to - backed with ENA.

Subject:	Portland Lease

I had a brief discussion with Marcus Buergler on Tuesday regarding the Portland space.  I indicated to him that our desire would be to move, but that we would need the current space for a short period until other arraingements can be made.  In the last two days we have done some research and think that we can get a better space for less money.  On top of that, there are roughly $600k worth of improvements (separating from PGE) that need to be made here that may not be required in a new sapce.

Based on my very brief discussion with Marcus on Tuesday, I was not aware that we wre heading down a path that would force us to stay in this building.  I learned today that the Estate has accepted the PGE lease for this space and that we have to stay here.  This is very depressing if it is true.

>From a money point of view I don't think that it is the best decsion.  More importantly, from a morale point of view this place is horrible.  We have 15,000 square feet when we need between 5,000 and 10,000.  It is absolutely depressing here.  People are very much in favor of moving.

Please advise.

Subject:	Transfers  to Netco

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?

Greetings:
 
As this extraordinary year draws to a close, we've been cooking up something to laugh about.  Click on the link below to see our latest animation, a fable about the Dotcom business.  Although the animation does not have a particular holiday theme, we offer it in the spirit of the season, and we hope you will enjoy it.  The animation has been compressed in both the latest Windows Media Player streaming format, and the QuickTime 5 format, so one of those is needed on your computer to view a playback.
 
Happy Holidays, and Best Wishes for the coming New Year.
 
 
Your Friends at FYI-Net

EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out.

Saw in the WSJ today that the judge allowed Enron to "end" 600-700 supply
contracts. Is that EES? If so are they going to still be in business? I ask
because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve-out. Is there
anything left to carve out??

It appears that the bonus numbers need further work.  Can you figure out a way of doing some sort of PRC where the guys get a number and then have to split it between their people.

Thanks

Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.  Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.

Contracts Structure

There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.


PassWord Application (PA)

The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  

The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. 

We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.


Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)

The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.


General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

To be sent when the Buyer is known.
When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. 

Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

Can you sende the attachment to all of the people (ex Enron only) on the lists (see in attachment) and copy to Par Odonnell and Mark Bridges - Dave Forster has their emails.

Thanks

I have already registered several domaine names in the interest of getting up and running as soon as possible post sale of the business.  I have experience of delays as we have tried to retrieve domaine names where people have squatted intentionally in order to extract large sums of cash.  Should any of the buyers raise any issues - I do intend to use these for the purposes of our new business.		
I have a lot of them - spurious and real.

As you know, we have used DealBench as our auction platform since inception and have been very pleased with the results.  Unfortunately, the costs associated with this proprietary platform make it cost prohibitive for Enron to sustain.  I would suggest that the more prudent approach is to determine the aggregate demand for such services and to utilize GSS to contract and manage a third party service/auction platform for Corp. and the commercial business units.

Subject: DealBench in 2002



As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

Tata in talks to buy Enron's Dabhol power plant - FT

10/14/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

TOKYO (AFX-ASIA) - Tata has held exploratory talks to buy Enron's power plant in Dabhol, India, the Financial Times reported. 
Tata Power has written to the Indian government expressing interest in the plant, though any deal would have to address the high tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project, the newspaper said.
It is understood that Enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents to the dollar, it said. 
Enron declined on Friday to confirm it was in talks with Tata, but said the best solution would be for the Indian government, or one of its Indian financial backers, to take on Dabhol. 
Tata Power recently held talks with Indian financial institutions involved with the project. Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, also attended. 
About 70 pct of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financial institutions providing 1.4 bln usd and foreign lenders the balance. 
Enron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to international lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the plant's sole client.

Qatar, Dolphin to sign final mega gas deal "shortly"

10/14/2001

ABU DHABI, Oct 14 (AFP) - Qatar and Dolphin Energy will sign the final development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) for a multi- billion-dollar project to deliver Qatari gas abroad "shortly", the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) said Sunday. 
"The development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) with Qatar Petroleum (QP) is due to be signed shortly," UOG said in a statement.
The state-run UOG added that Dolphin Energy will select by early next year an oil major to become a strategic partner in the project. 
"Over the coming weeks, the international oil companies will be given additional data and invited to submit their offers by late December. One of them is scheduled to be selected in early 2002," UOG said. 
UOG held separate negotiations last week with five shortlisted oil majors -- Conoco, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum of the United States, BP International and the Anglo-Dutch firm Shell -- to replace the US firm Enron Corp., which withdrew from the venture in May and transferred its 24.5 percent stake to UOG. 
Enron's role was to build a 350-kilometre (220-mile) pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. 
The Dolphin project aims to create a regional grid taking gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman and eventually Pakistan. 
In a project estimated at an overall cost of up to 10 billion dollars, the gas is to be transported by undersea pipeline from Qatar to the Abu Dhabi coast. 
The gas will be distributed inside Abu Dhabi and neighbouring Dubai through existing networks and will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted. 
The pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline. The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars.

NATURAL GAS BIG IN STATE'S FUTURE > NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDS
Antonio Fins Business Writer

10/14/2001

Prodded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals, natural gas is set to become a major player in Florida's energy grid. 
The state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade, natural gas will account for 44 percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities, up from about 18 percent now. Utility companies use 85 percent of the natural gas burned in Florida.
As energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas 100 miles off Florida's coast, other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas. 
Gulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area. Enron Corp. of Houston is proposing to spend as much as $400 million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades. 
Enron's proposal is drawing rivals. El Paso Corp., also in Houston, wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach. And AES Corp. has purchased Ocean Cay, a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades. 
The proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups. Ultimately, federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed. 
Still, electric companies, which are proposing to build more than 80 new power plants in Florida through 2010, are looking to make heavy use of natural gas. 
"Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas," said Michael Haff, an engineer at the PSC. "That's the reason for the large increase" in projections of natural gas usage. 
All this is quite a change for Florida's electric utilities. For decades, power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Florida's power plants than to pipe in natural gas. 
Nor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida. Most users are small factories, public laundries and restaurants, where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because it's easier to control the heat. With little need for heating homes in winter, residential use has generally been limited to barbecues, water heaters and stoves. 
Consequently, Florida uses far less natural gas than many states. Household use of natural gas is less than one-fifth of what some households in other parts of the country use. 
The motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors. The federal Clean Air act, signed into law in 1990, is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators. 
Natural gas is one of those options. 
Alvaro Linero, the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said natural gas emits no particulate matter, the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions. Unlike oil or coal, it gives off no sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions, a key component of smog, when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal. 
Florida Power & Light Co., the largest of the electric companies, has already heavily invested in natural gas generators -- 21 of its 29 non-nuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas. 
FPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money, but the utility, regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch. 
Another factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability. By 2005, natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline, which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico, is finished. Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline projects as well. 
Still, some environmental groups say that, while they want cleaner energy, they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears. 
One concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks. Enron, which applied to build a Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline, said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe. But Broward officials and a conservationist group, Hollywood-based Save Our Shores, have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins. 
The safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently. After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad, N.M., last year, killing 12 people, the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing. 
And the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates. 
They insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters, stoves and even gas-run air conditioning units -- a more efficient and cost-effective use of natural gas than running electric generators, they argue. 
But state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and re-landscaping, so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic. 
Disagreements aside, the consensus is that the state's power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option. 
"We don't expect [natural gas usage] to decline. If anything, we may see an increase," said Lance Horton, marketing director for People's Gas Co. "At the end of the day, the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before."

Debt load smothers Polaroid; Bankruptcy filing pointing to sale, firings
GREG GATLIN

10/13/2001
Boston Herald
All Editions

Polaroid Corp., one of Massachusetts' most-storied innovators, sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company. 
The highly anticipated move capped a rocky period under Chief Executive Gary DiCamillo and marked an extraordinary fall for the 64- year-old Cambridge instant-photography legend.
The company that helped define Route 128 as America's Technology Highway, slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in 1978, when it employed nearly 21,000. 
It has local operations in Bedford, Cambridge, New Bedford, Norton, Norwood, Waltham and Wayland. 
Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce its work force to 5,500. Yesterday, the company said it will cut more. 
It's been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy. 
"How such a place, with so much success and so much technology, could lose that much money and get into so much debt, I don't understand," said Lloyd Taylor, a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company. "A lot of people I've known, both retirees and some that are still there, are just totally demoralized." 
Polaroid, founded by visionary Edwin H. Land in 1937, said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instant-film products, even as it "accelerates and intensifies" its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection. 
But it will slash operations, with an unspecified number of job cuts expected. Anything that's not part of its core business - products that rely on instant film - is subject to sale or elimination. 
That includes the company's sunglass division, its photo- identification business, and others. Polaroid, already selling off real estate and other assets, will seek to sell more and will shutter plants. 
Spokesman Skip Colcord would not provide specifics regarding closings or job cut plans. "I think everything's on the table," he said. 
Polaroid confirmed it terminated its retiree health and life insurance plans as well as severance payments to former U.S. employees. 
A federal bankruptcy judge authorized $13.1 million until Monday for employee wages and checks outstanding, said Polaroid lawyer Gregg Galardi. It will seek approval to continue employee health care benefit payments as well, and to honor service warranties on products. 
In its filing, Polaroid listed $1.81 billion in assets and $948.4 million in debt. Top creditors include Enron Energy Services, Tad Resources International and Dupont Teijin Films US, all with multi- million dollar claims. 
As expected, Polaroid said it had obtained a commitment for $50 million in so-called debtor-in-possession financing from a bank group led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Polaroid will seek court approval to use $40 million of that loan Monday to meet obligations, including paying suppliers on or after yesterday's filing. Lawyers also said Polaroid had a $33 million offer for its identification business. 
Crushed by the weight of its debt, including about $600 million owed to bondholders and $335 in bank loans, Polaroid had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for months, and received a series of waivers on terms of its lending agreements, while it sought a buyer for some or all of its assets. 
Its once-mighty instant-film business was turned into a cash generator to fund development of new digital-imaging technologies. Earlier this year, Polaroid unveiled new digital printing technology, code-named Opal and Onyx, designed to let consumers and businesses instantly develop prints taken with digital cameras. 
Some say Polaroid lost a step with the departure of Land, its founder and visionary, who stepped down as chief executive in 1980 and as chairman in 1982. Land died in 1991. 
A Harvard University dropout and son of a scrap-metal dealer, Land began to research light polarization in the 1920s, focusing on sunglasses, desk lamps and reducing car headlight glare, before turning to instant film. 
As legend has it, Land took a picture of his young daughter on a vacation in Santa Fe, N.M., and she asked why she couldn't see the picture right away. Land set to work on the problem immediately, and before long was applying for patents. 
By 1988, Polaroid was trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid. Financier Stanley Gold's Shamrock Holdings had offered $3 billion for Polaroid, or about $45 a share. Company management eventually rebuffed Shamrock, but spent millions in legal fees and racked up a massive debt to block the takeover bid, from which it has yet to recover.

WORLD NEWS - Enron wins court injunction - NEWS DIGEST.

Enron wins court injunction 
Enron, which is poised to pull out of the largest foreign direct investment in India, has won an injunction from a court in London preventing the regional government of Maharashtra from challenging arbitration proceedings launched by the US power company.
Enron's opponents say the court decision, which is confined to appeals in India, significantly reduces legal defences for Maharashtra, where the 2,184MW power plant is located, and is likely to raise the stakes in the Houston-based company's increasingly messy attempt to withdraw from India with full compensation. 
Officials at Enron's Indian arm, Dabhol Power, say the legal move was designed to prevent Maharashtra from trying to stall arbitration through endless legal obstacles. This is what has happened between Enron and its sole Indian client, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Khozem Merchant, Bombay.

Jim - 

Following up on our discussion.......

Thank you for taking the lead to prep and set up a meeting(s) to get the appropriate team(s) prepared to testify on January 24, 2002.

I realize that there will be many different activities underway in the next couple of weeks, and we all include maintaining / maximizing the value of the CA book and the CPUC activities as critically important.


Thanks - Dan

I tracked back through the HR names to see if I can get to 9. They would be:
 
Specialists
Neil Davies  - team lead
Kari Oquinn - comp
Tony Garrett - payroll and benefits
Karen Buckley - recruiting, A&A's, training and management reports
Generalists
Jeanie Slone - OTC, Gas Commercial teams, Denver, Mexico, New York
Amy Fitzpatrick - Power Commercial teams, Calgary and Portland
Mandy Curless - IT, Back office and support groups
 
Me
Julie Clyatt - group admin
 
Please bear in mind it would be imperative to make sure the following stay in estate for at least 90 days and help us with transition (ie not sure we can do everything we need to with above team):
 
*Tana Cashion - Generalist 
Sarah Zargowski - Generalist
Anne Labbe - Admin
*Julie Kearney - Portland/Calagry HR rep
Charles Philpot - HRIS
Tharsie Broussard - Comp reporting number 2.
 
Above are names I am suggesting come off list to get to 9.* names are one's ideally I'd like to add back.
 
David

We'll guarantee a minimum of $200,000 for 2002 based on current price of $25,000 per data room.  We will not agree to an allocation though.
 
Thanks

Subject: DealBench in 2002


As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

I had a call about getting a new one in Baughmans team. Sounds like he needs a assistant come specialist. He knows someone at EES. I've told him to have some conversations and see if she's interested.

Are you vetoing all new assistants/clerk into ENA?

I think we should be selective.

Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??)

(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month
	Probability:	50%
	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

(iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)

Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.

So I never got paid (expenses) for my tickets home.  Surprize!!!!!  So if I cancel - obviously as I didn't go.  Can I then reclaim the economy ones I booked for my parents and brother instead as I did not take my 2001 entitlement.  The tickets were all economy (4 x $1374:74).  A lot cheaper still than three business seats.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Barbara,

It's Saturday night in Houston and Marcus (my husband) and I just hung your painting in our dining room.  It looks unbelievable - we love it.  I decided because I loved it too much to bring in home and it is now in our home.  Thankyou so much .

Tammie will sort our the money on Monday.

I love it so much I had to bring it home.It is far too good for work.

Take care and obviously our thoughts are with you at this time.  We look forward to the yellow one and we have already decided where to put it.  I will take so photos so you can see how prominent the red one is in our home.

Take care 

Louise

PDT. Louise: I'm very happy that you liked your painting!! The "yellow" one

Louise,

Attached is the list I have collected so far. Please let me know if this is what you need.

I think the attached substantiates two issues:

1) EES is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities (and they are being quite up-front about this)

2) EES is approaching industrials which fall within ENA SIC codes.

     Tammie-
     
     Can you kindly confirm details of where, when, # of sessions if 
     greater than one, for this presentation.  I understand you are the 
     person Louise had designated to help us coordinate the 
     presentation/training.  It will be a powerpoint presentation that we 
     need your assistance ensuring can be projected as well ensuring the 
     traders/business have adequate number of copies of hand out material.
     
     Attached is the presentation.  Hand outs that we require your 
     assistance in handling is:
     
     - Presentation print out
     
     - Mercy Gil to supply you with a printed list of contact names phone 
     and cell phones by end of day today
     
     - Wendy Bannerman Clarke to supply the Day 1 Policy (even if still a 
     draft) as well as the Discipline and Sanction policy by end of day 
     today.  
     
     Tammie - If you can get all the hand outs in 1 pack that would be 
     great but it is not required.
     
     Please speak with Debbie Brackett if you have any questions, issues, 
     etc and we thank you very much in advance for your assistance.
     
     Looking forward to meeting you,

Louise,
I obviously don't agree on the decision that was made.  The decision to make me a director in the new company should be based upon my abilities as a marketer and the specific role that you want me to undertake for UBS.  Needless to say, I am disappointed but signed the document as the deadline approached quickly.

EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out.

Saw in the WSJ today that the judge allowed Enron to "end" 600-700 supply
contracts. Is that EES? If so are they going to still be in business? I ask
because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve-out. Is there
anything left to carve out??

The following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online
trading.  These contracts govern the actual transaction process and are
accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically.
Password Application	-  In writing
Electronic Trading Agreement	- Electronically

These documents do not have any customer specific terms (eg credit etc) as
they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions, but
simply the utiliszation of the website.  The General Terms and Conditions
will be issued to the known Buyer as they do have credit terms etc.

Please let me, Dave Forster or Mark Taylor know if you would require further
information.

Louise,

David asked that review the attached requests in his absence.  Both are replacement contracts at equal or less value than what we offered in original contracts.  Thanks.


Jenai-Kari will send the info as soon as we receive it from the estate.  Please place priority on the contract for Schields as we would like to have a fax as soon as possible on Thursday.  Call me on Thurs am if you still do not have what you need.  Thanks.

Jeanie

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

 
On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.
 
Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?

Thanks

Louise

Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The plan is to issue the closing announcement on
Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for when the website officially launches, which is
expected on Monday (2/11).

Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the new management. I need from Human Resources
confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There will also be internal publicity on the day the
website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
integration site.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,

Claudia

So far I have spoken to both Bill and Rick Buy, both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it.  I have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff.

I left a message for Bill this morning to see if he had made further progress.

Do you really have someone as capable as Marcello.  This is an outstanding trader who we probably have no chance of getting but could run any desk we have.  Is your SE guy of that quality?

Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?

Scott 

Mark Taylor forwarded me your request, I thought it may be helpful to introduce myself and Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  As Mark probably already informed you we are taking the opportunity to update the PA and ETA.  Under the timescale we do plan to have these with you today.  

Should Citigroup be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name "citigroupenergy.com, 'ssmbenergy.com' or 'ssbenergy.com'.  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.

Thanks

Joe Deffner needs to take responsibility for reducing these costs and ensuring that our allocations are appropriate - the ones that really stand out to me are Kelly Boots and Glisan.  Joe needs to get comfortable with their allocation methodology.

Here is our plan on PRC.

Assistants:

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings.

Non Commercial but in North America:

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC.

Analysts and Associates

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria.

VP's

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay.

Cheers as you Brits say

Firstly, Dave is not responsible for the initial creation of these numbers which was done by Brad Richter before Dave joined the group.  I presume it was based on Brad's evaluations. 
 
I suggest we wait another week to see the structure of the transaction before moving numbers.

Subject: Proposed Retention Bonuses for Netco
Sensitivity: Confidential


Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer

Louise:

I unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as I was interviewing analyst candidates, however the overall reaction from the group seems to be positive and I applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone.

I realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidity and therefore I felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the current situation.  Since most of our activities seem to require some amount of capital, I was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn Carl Tricoli's prepay concept for IPP's on its head and reverse the transaction with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and deliver power in the future.  Assuming we can find the right counterparties, then we in essence would achieve a short position (which seems to be more in line with your strategic thoughts) and pick up liquidity in the short run.

Regards,

Charlie

I want to make sure we are on exactly the same wavelength here:

EnronOnline (i.e. the people on the list you gave me) now reports to you through me and therefore is no longer a part of Enron Networks.

Right?

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=

Please advise.

Louise - Thanks.  It looks very good.  I made a few minor changes this evening to add "units of measure" to 1-2 slides ($ in millions).  Also, will increase the size of fonts on the US map/structuring slides so the group will be sure to see them.  Terry and Steve now have the "Master" and will shoot it back to you on Monday, probably around mid-morning so you will know of these minor changes, each intended to enhance visibility without changing any content.  Terry will be in touch, or you can reach her at ext. 36910 if necessary.  Again, thanks.  'Have a great weekend.  Paula
 
Terry - Please be sure Wes sees the Financial Highlights chart from Butts.  THX

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News
By Peter Edmonston

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
The Wall Street Journal Online 
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session. 
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened. 
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment. 
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. "The market is really shrugging off this news," said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift. 
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt. 
The uncertainty on the global front "looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair," Mr. Kroll said. "I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven." 
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. "The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings," said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added. 
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued. 
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates. 
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates. 
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32. 
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74. 
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts. 
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40. 
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be "difficult." 
Companies "are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter," said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as "double witching." 
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65. 
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower. 
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading. 
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown. 
In major U.S. market action: 
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%. 
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.

Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts

10/22/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships. 
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information. 
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors. More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com.

USA: UPDATE 3-SEC looks into Enron deals, stock slides 20 pct.
By David Howard Sinkman

10/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry.
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related party transactions" involved the partnerships. 
"Related party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. 
"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." 
Shares in the company are down 75 percent this year.

Enron shares plunge 20 percent after acknowledging SEC inquiry

10/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged more than 20 percent Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer. 
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week.
"We welcome this request," Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said in a statement Monday. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." 
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000. 
Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions. 
"Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," according to the section in the annual report. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an "informal inquiry." 
"This is not an investigation," he said. "We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us." 
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. "We can't confirm or deny that type of activity," Heine said. 
The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower after SEC questions transactions; AG Edwards downgrades

10/22/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down sharply in late morning trade, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions, prompting AG Edwards to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy', dealers said. 
At 11.10 am, Enron was down 4.29 usd, or 16.47 pct, at 21.76. The DJIA was up 57.57 points at 9,261.68, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 5.57 points at 1,079.05.
In a statement this morning, Enron confirmed that the SEC had requested documents, and said it would "cooperate fully" with the commission. 
However, the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC's request. 
According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim, Enron "significantly reduced" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially-owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron's chief financial officer. 
"This arrangement, which was not discussed in past SEC filings, has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community. 
"In our opinion, the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days. 
"However, we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed," Heim said. 
In its statement this morning, Enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related-party arrangements, adding that the Board was "fully informed of and approved these arrangements", which were disclosed in the company's SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," said chief executive Kenneth Lay.

HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading concern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about "certain related party transactions," including those between Enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. 
Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepared statement that it "welcomes" the request and looks forward to put "any concern about these transactions to rest."
In 4 p.m. EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fell $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65. 
Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in profits in transactions with the firm. The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document. 
Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited partnership created by Mr. Fastow. 
In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share. Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter. 
The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow. 
The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million and involve the early termination of "certain structured finance arrangements." 
The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported. 
The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said on Monday. 
Separately, an Enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in Texas court alleging Enron's board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
A law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Mr. Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest. 
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Mr. Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

      Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

                           Shares Plunge

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

      Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

      Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

Its the week-end so I am finally doing my emails.
 
I forgot to thank Leslie for doing these - so thanks Leslie it was appreciated.

Subject: 


Attached please find the proposed Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application for Netco.  I have included a clean copy of each document as well as a red-lined copy marked against the version sent to Mark Taylor by Dave and Carl. 
 
You will note that I have made a number of changes to the original EOL documents.  
 
1.  The Password Application.
 
The Password Application contains no substantive changes.  I advise that we retain the original description of the website as a platform for the "purchase and sale of products and instruments based on energy products or other commodities (including derivative products)".  The description is sufficiently broad to cover any potential expansion beyond the original gas and power products, as well as third party product offerings.  After a brief discussion regarding the auction platform with Louise, I revised the PA to reinsert references to the auction.
 
2.  The Electronic Trading Agreement.
 
There are numerous revisions and additions to the ETA.  I outline below a few of the key changes requiring your consideration:
 
a.  I added a sentence at the end of Section 1 to make clear that in the event the ETA conflicted with any other agreement between the parties, including any terms posted on the Website, the ETA controls.
 
b.  I added a new Section 2(h) to address Counterparty content posted on any public area of the Website.  To the extent that we anticipate such a capability in the future, it may be a good idea to include such a provision.  If we do include this section, do we want to limit our license of the content to use on the Website and related materials, as proposed here?  If you do not want to include such a limitation, we can add the word "worldwide" to the first sentence before the word "royalty-free" and delete the balance of the final sentence after the phrase "not distorted by displaying only a part)".
 
c.  I revised Section 3(e) to clarify that Netco is not required to send written confirmations of on-line transactions and to provide that electronic records are admissible as evidence of the transaction.  The last sentence of the section is intended to make clear that to the extent the master agreement requires a written confirmation, such master agreement controls, provided that the failure to send a confirmation will not invalidate the transaction.
 
d.  I added a new Section 4 to address transactions posted by unaffiliated third parties.  (This issue was already covered in the last paragraph of the original PA.)
 
e.  I revised Section 5(a) to clarify that Netco is not liable for any direct damages and to expressly cap its damages to amounts paid by Counterparty for accessing the Website.
 
f.  I revised Section 5(b) and (c) in response to issues raised by many counterparties when I negotiated EOL ETA issues. 
 
g.  Section 6(a) has been revised to expressly provide that Confidential Information excludes counterparty identifying information, as well as transactional or biographical information in statistical form.  Please let me know if you disagree with the scope of this exclusion.  If you don't want to exclude counterpary identifying information, we can merely delete the phrase "the identification of Counterpartt as a user of the Website and shall also exclude".  I added a 1-year term following expiration of the ETA to the confidentiality obligation in Section 6(d), reasoning that most of the confidential information protected by this Section belongs to the Counterparty, not Netco, and thus desiring some cut off point for our obligation to maintain confidentiality.
 
 
A number of our counterparties enter into transaction by and through service companies or agents.  I have prepared a revised Password Application, side letter to the ETA, and Consent and Acknowledgment form to be utilized by such counterparties and attach these documents below for your review and reference as well.
 
Please give me a call with any questions or comments.
 
Regards,
 
Leslie

Agreed - sorry I had thought Lavo sorted this out.  As we understand, Caroline wants to work in Manhattan and therefore we need to look at those offices.

Tammy Shepperd is the person to contact.

Tammy can you please sort out Caroline - same issues as Mike McDonald but New York.

Louise, I talked in detail with Caroline this am. We need to identify where Caroline is going to reside. I understand that UBS has two operations in NY - I think you and Hutchins need to decide what makes the most sense (ie synergies). It is critical that we get this resolved so that Caroline has some infrastructure around her.

Amy,

I anticipate we are going to lose an employee to a competitor this morning. Accordingly, I would like to revise our Estate/Netco transfer list.

Can I give you an update later today?

Louise, 
Do you anticipate needing one more set of OOC executive furnishings or will 2 satisfy us?

Thanks,

Louise,

I have master counterparty lists from credit, legal and eol.  Milnthorp and I are getting input from the various desks - we have "national accounts", large regionals and customers.  They are ranked by volume and include type of contract, entity name, credit limits, etc. There are approx 50 counterparties that we want to hit in the first week of business.   We will have some good detail by jan 7.

Regards,

Chris

We are a little closer to our Q3 targets of $ 2MM in sept.  

Please call if there are any questions.

Any chance you're available on the 3rd?  I recognize you're heavily tied into credit issues right now, but a quick "intro" meeting might help convince them that we're still in the origination business.

Louise,
 
I need to bring this to close.
 
I am going to decompose Beth's group into a number of smaller units, leaving the most important areas in ENA, namely GAS/Power Front and Back office. I am going to leave Anthony running EES, but need someone who can work well with Anthony on developing the strategy for the new longer term solutions, as well as what he is trying to achieve in the short term.
 
The final candidates are Steve Stock, Everett Plant, and as possible late entry John Paskin (although he doesn't know this yet and I have him tagged to run Corporate Systems). From a collaboration perspective I am leaning towards Stocky. We have all spoken with Everett and are impressed with his 'gloss'. I'm just not sure he is the right person to give the 'crown jewels' to, my gut tells me he is good at managing up, but may not be the best collaborative team member (and I need that).
 
Let mk know what you think
 
Thanks

Nothing we need right now.  Things he may need to know:
1.  Pleased with our relationship so far.  Looking forward to market opening.
2.  We are discussing a number of other possible transactions with them including:
Possible options (either our call or their put) for power from the Bruce A units 3&4.  They are attempting to bring these back on line.  This deal would help them ensure the economic viability of doing the refurbishment.  I believe these would not come back until fall 2003 at the earliest.
Short term deals for early next year after market opening
Possible purchase of green power from their wind units at the Bruce

We are also trying to work more closely with them on the lobbying front for market opening.  This may be something he should try to sniff out to see whether they really care if the market opens early next year or not.  The people over here seem to be talking the talk that they do.

Cheers, Paul D

has a lunch tomorrow with the Chairman of British Energy.  Is there anything you want to get from that or should he just bluff his way through.

Let me know

I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.  We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA Houston (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).  They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.  

Contact IT if they haven't contacted you.  Steve Harrington or Jenny Rub.

I tracked back through the HR names to see if I can get to 9. They would be:
 
Specialists
Neil Davies  - team lead
Kari Oquinn - comp
Tony Garrett - payroll and benefits
Karen Buckley - recruiting, A&A's, training and management reports
Generalists
Jeanie Slone - OTC, Gas Commercial teams, Denver, Mexico, New York
Amy Fitzpatrick - Power Commercial teams, Calgary and Portland
Mandy Curless - IT, Back office and support groups
 
Me
Julie Clyatt - group admin
 
Please bear in mind it would be imperative to make sure the following stay in estate for at least 90 days and help us with transition (ie not sure we can do everything we need to with above team):
 
*Tana Cashion - Generalist 
Sarah Zargowski - Generalist
Anne Labbe - Admin
*Julie Kearney - Portland/Calagry HR rep
Charles Philpot - HRIS
Tharsie Broussard - Comp reporting number 2.
 
Above are names I am suggesting come off list to get to 9.* names are one's ideally I'd like to add back.
 
David

Hello Louise,Dave,David,

Is there any reason why we should not get started with the process of
getting business cards and Amex cards for all folks that have signed
up to join the new entity?

Tata in talks to buy Enron's Dabhol power plant - FT

10/14/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

TOKYO (AFX-ASIA) - Tata has held exploratory talks to buy Enron's power plant in Dabhol, India, the Financial Times reported. 
Tata Power has written to the Indian government expressing interest in the plant, though any deal would have to address the high tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project, the newspaper said.
It is understood that Enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents to the dollar, it said. 
Enron declined on Friday to confirm it was in talks with Tata, but said the best solution would be for the Indian government, or one of its Indian financial backers, to take on Dabhol. 
Tata Power recently held talks with Indian financial institutions involved with the project. Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, also attended. 
About 70 pct of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financial institutions providing 1.4 bln usd and foreign lenders the balance. 
Enron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to international lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the plant's sole client.

Qatar, Dolphin to sign final mega gas deal "shortly"

10/14/2001

ABU DHABI, Oct 14 (AFP) - Qatar and Dolphin Energy will sign the final development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) for a multi- billion-dollar project to deliver Qatari gas abroad "shortly", the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) said Sunday. 
"The development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) with Qatar Petroleum (QP) is due to be signed shortly," UOG said in a statement.
The state-run UOG added that Dolphin Energy will select by early next year an oil major to become a strategic partner in the project. 
"Over the coming weeks, the international oil companies will be given additional data and invited to submit their offers by late December. One of them is scheduled to be selected in early 2002," UOG said. 
UOG held separate negotiations last week with five shortlisted oil majors -- Conoco, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum of the United States, BP International and the Anglo-Dutch firm Shell -- to replace the US firm Enron Corp., which withdrew from the venture in May and transferred its 24.5 percent stake to UOG. 
Enron's role was to build a 350-kilometre (220-mile) pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. 
The Dolphin project aims to create a regional grid taking gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman and eventually Pakistan. 
In a project estimated at an overall cost of up to 10 billion dollars, the gas is to be transported by undersea pipeline from Qatar to the Abu Dhabi coast. 
The gas will be distributed inside Abu Dhabi and neighbouring Dubai through existing networks and will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted. 
The pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline. The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars.

NATURAL GAS BIG IN STATE'S FUTURE > NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDS
Antonio Fins Business Writer

10/14/2001

(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

Prodded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals, natural gas is set to become a major player in Florida's energy grid. 
The state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade, natural gas will account for 44 percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities, up from about 18 percent now. Utility companies use 85 percent of the natural gas burned in Florida.
As energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas 100 miles off Florida's coast, other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas. 
Gulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area. Enron Corp. of Houston is proposing to spend as much as $400 million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades. 
Enron's proposal is drawing rivals. El Paso Corp., also in Houston, wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach. And AES Corp. has purchased Ocean Cay, a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades. 
The proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups. Ultimately, federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed. 
Still, electric companies, which are proposing to build more than 80 new power plants in Florida through 2010, are looking to make heavy use of natural gas. 
"Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas," said Michael Haff, an engineer at the PSC. "That's the reason for the large increase" in projections of natural gas usage. 
All this is quite a change for Florida's electric utilities. For decades, power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Florida's power plants than to pipe in natural gas. 
Nor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida. Most users are small factories, public laundries and restaurants, where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because it's easier to control the heat. With little need for heating homes in winter, residential use has generally been limited to barbecues, water heaters and stoves. 
Consequently, Florida uses far less natural gas than many states. Household use of natural gas is less than one-fifth of what some households in other parts of the country use. 
The motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors. The federal Clean Air act, signed into law in 1990, is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators. 
Natural gas is one of those options. 
Alvaro Linero, the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said natural gas emits no particulate matter, the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions. Unlike oil or coal, it gives off no sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions, a key component of smog, when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal. 
Florida Power & Light Co., the largest of the electric companies, has already heavily invested in natural gas generators -- 21 of its 29 non-nuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas. 
FPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money, but the utility, regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch. 
Another factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability. By 2005, natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline, which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico, is finished. Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline projects as well. 
Still, some environmental groups say that, while they want cleaner energy, they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears. 
One concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks. Enron, which applied to build a Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline, said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe. But Broward officials and a conservationist group, Hollywood-based Save Our Shores, have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins. 
The safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently. After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad, N.M., last year, killing 12 people, the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing. 
And the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates. 
They insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters, stoves and even gas-run air conditioning units -- a more efficient and cost-effective use of natural gas than running electric generators, they argue. 
But state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and re-landscaping, so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic. 
Disagreements aside, the consensus is that the state's power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option. 
"We don't expect [natural gas usage] to decline. If anything, we may see an increase," said Lance Horton, marketing director for People's Gas Co. "At the end of the day, the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before."

Debt load smothers Polaroid; Bankruptcy filing pointing to sale, firings
GREG GATLIN

10/13/2001
Boston Herald
All Editions
020
(Copyright 2001)

Polaroid Corp., one of Massachusetts' most-storied innovators, sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company. 
The highly anticipated move capped a rocky period under Chief Executive Gary DiCamillo and marked an extraordinary fall for the 64- year-old Cambridge instant-photography legend.
The company that helped define Route 128 as America's Technology Highway, slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in 1978, when it employed nearly 21,000. 
It has local operations in Bedford, Cambridge, New Bedford, Norton, Norwood, Waltham and Wayland. 
Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce its work force to 5,500. Yesterday, the company said it will cut more. 
It's been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy. 
"How such a place, with so much success and so much technology, could lose that much money and get into so much debt, I don't understand," said Lloyd Taylor, a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company. "A lot of people I've known, both retirees and some that are still there, are just totally demoralized." 
Polaroid, founded by visionary Edwin H. Land in 1937, said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instant-film products, even as it "accelerates and intensifies" its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection. 
But it will slash operations, with an unspecified number of job cuts expected. Anything that's not part of its core business - products that rely on instant film - is subject to sale or elimination. 
That includes the company's sunglass division, its photo- identification business, and others. Polaroid, already selling off real estate and other assets, will seek to sell more and will shutter plants. 
Spokesman Skip Colcord would not provide specifics regarding closings or job cut plans. "I think everything's on the table," he said. 
Polaroid confirmed it terminated its retiree health and life insurance plans as well as severance payments to former U.S. employees. 
A federal bankruptcy judge authorized $13.1 million until Monday for employee wages and checks outstanding, said Polaroid lawyer Gregg Galardi. It will seek approval to continue employee health care benefit payments as well, and to honor service warranties on products. 
In its filing, Polaroid listed $1.81 billion in assets and $948.4 million in debt. Top creditors include Enron Energy Services, Tad Resources International and Dupont Teijin Films US, all with multi- million dollar claims. 
As expected, Polaroid said it had obtained a commitment for $50 million in so-called debtor-in-possession financing from a bank group led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Polaroid will seek court approval to use $40 million of that loan Monday to meet obligations, including paying suppliers on or after yesterday's filing. Lawyers also said Polaroid had a $33 million offer for its identification business. 
Crushed by the weight of its debt, including about $600 million owed to bondholders and $335 in bank loans, Polaroid had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for months, and received a series of waivers on terms of its lending agreements, while it sought a buyer for some or all of its assets. 
Its once-mighty instant-film business was turned into a cash generator to fund development of new digital-imaging technologies. Earlier this year, Polaroid unveiled new digital printing technology, code-named Opal and Onyx, designed to let consumers and businesses instantly develop prints taken with digital cameras. 
Some say Polaroid lost a step with the departure of Land, its founder and visionary, who stepped down as chief executive in 1980 and as chairman in 1982. Land died in 1991. 
A Harvard University dropout and son of a scrap-metal dealer, Land began to research light polarization in the 1920s, focusing on sunglasses, desk lamps and reducing car headlight glare, before turning to instant film. 
As legend has it, Land took a picture of his young daughter on a vacation in Santa Fe, N.M., and she asked why she couldn't see the picture right away. Land set to work on the problem immediately, and before long was applying for patents. 
By 1988, Polaroid was trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid. Financier Stanley Gold's Shamrock Holdings had offered $3 billion for Polaroid, or about $45 a share. Company management eventually rebuffed Shamrock, but spent millions in legal fees and racked up a massive debt to block the takeover bid, from which it has yet to recover.

WORLD NEWS - Enron wins court injunction - NEWS DIGEST.

Enron wins court injunction 
Enron, which is poised to pull out of the largest foreign direct investment in India, has won an injunction from a court in London preventing the regional government of Maharashtra from challenging arbitration proceedings launched by the US power company.
Enron's opponents say the court decision, which is confined to appeals in India, significantly reduces legal defences for Maharashtra, where the 2,184MW power plant is located, and is likely to raise the stakes in the Houston-based company's increasingly messy attempt to withdraw from India with full compensation. 
Officials at Enron's Indian arm, Dabhol Power, say the legal move was designed to prevent Maharashtra from trying to stall arbitration through endless legal obstacles. This is what has happened between Enron and its sole Indian client, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Khozem Merchant, Bombay.

I talked to Bob on Friday.  He is involved with Jay and the IT people on the system plan.

The only item open, I think, is a deal with EC Outlook concerning the EDI Hub.  Jay  and Bob
McAllif are working with them. Won't need right way, used for physical gas.

He is also working on a list of contracts needed with the pipelines and LDC's.

I'll keep you posted if I see any problems with logistics.

thanks

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Louise / Greg,
 
here is the updated spreadsheet (password 5555).... we miscounted slightly the total is 131 not 126. 
 
Geoff Storey asked me to make sure Larissa Sharma was included in the group as well.
 
The area colum hasn't been altered to reflect the 'new' role yet...... we've had to stop for a moment to find over 700 telephone numbers.... :(
 
regards
 
Steve

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=
c. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

Sabra Dinari

Are you attending the Employee Mtg. on Tues. at the Hyatt?  If so, should I reschedule the weekly Power Origination mtg. or cancel it?

Also, the weekly Wed. Power Mtgs. w/Presto and others-should all of these be cancelled or should John be meeting with these guys instead of you?

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

This has got to be the last time.

Tomorrow morning a new team will arrive for due diligence purposes.

Tom Martin will be hosting this team

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows.  It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Tom   .  

9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
9:30		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:00		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
10:30		Credit				Bradford
11:00		Back Office			Beck/Hall

12:00	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
12:45		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub / Bob 
1:15		HR				Oxley

Afternoon	Dataroom and Trader discussions

Please make yourselves available.

Tammie - please check availability.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

The Maple Leaf is sending a team of 9 people.  They should arrive between 8 and 8:30 Wednesday morning and stay through Thursday evening (They are planning on a late night on Wed).  

We are currently planning on using room 3371 for the data room, but are looking for another room that might be more accomodating for such a large group.  Please let me know who your point person will be and the schedule for the initial meetings.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Jim,

There is a lot of confusion over the scope and scale of services that the estate will require from UBS over the next several months.  During the negotiations over the Transistion Services Agreement, it was clearly contemplated that the estate will need UBS to schedule and purchase power as an agent of the estate.  However, most of the UBS team does not understand or expect to provide these types of services.  I know that you have coordinated with Greg Whalley but I feel it is necessary that we have a broader coordination meeting between the two organizations.  I think this meeting needs to happen at your level.

Thanks,

Paul

Louise,

Chip will want to talk with you about the Longview equipment.  We are circulating a DASH to enable us to continue making payments.  If we do not continue to make payments, we forfeit the equipment and take a $23MM hit.  This is approximately 35% of the total equipment contract.  I think the equipment is worth more (than 65%) and I believe that we will get out of this problem with less than a $22MM hit.  I therefore recommend that we commit the extra $ for this equipment.  It will continue to be funded off B/S.  

We continue to have discussions/negotiations with Calpine, NRG and TransAlta.  We have also opened up general equipment discussions with Mirant and AES.  

Regards,

Chris Calger

Subject:	NY CANCELLATION

I have been working with my national sales representative from the Four Seasons Hotel to minimize our contract obligations from our cancellation of the New York Customer Holiday Event dated November 30 - December 2, 2001.

The contract states that if Enron should cancel the entire event within 90 days - 61 days prior to the scheduled commencement date of the event, Enron would be liable for 50% of the hotels liquidated damages, which is estimated at $28,218.

After numerous conversations with the hotel, they have agreed to accept our initial deposit of $15,000 as full payment for the cancellation of this event.  No additional costs will be charged to Enron.  I believe that this is a fair offer and hope that all parties involved find this acceptable.

In the meantime, I received a call from Laura Luce this morning and she is interested in continuing this event on a much reduced scale.  The Four Seasons is willing to hold our initial reservation, with no additional penalties, until we can confirm if we would like to proceed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Louise,

John Donnelly said his deal guys would like to see a slightly more detailed org chart which addressed what the org structure and main functions were under each of the technical and support areas. He gave me impression he wanted to understand for example what Accounting/CFO team did exactly. I think the chart we sent them previously was fairly detailed on the main commercial, senior management and EOL areas, but was silent below Webb(dev'lp), Hall, Rub, Colwell, myself, Headicke/Taylor, Bradford, Buy?, etc.,

Should I send a request around or would you prefer to send it?

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative
2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to "buy- speculative," from "buy-high risk", to reflect his concerns that "lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations." 
"This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked," he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  "We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron," said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). "It's business as usual." 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  "Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution," said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 


Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
"It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO," Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
"We're always willing to sit down with a customer," Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
"To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away," he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
"That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing," Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
"We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers," Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. 
In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. 
The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. 
Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. 
Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. 
In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 
Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. 
Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. 
States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. 
In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. 
In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. 
Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. 
In major U.S. market action Wednesday: 
Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. 
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E
2001-10-25 12:07 (New York)

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron
Corp. Common Stock

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox
(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and
certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is
brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common
stock of Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,
2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").

The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants
engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates
and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial
position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from
the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve
Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an
artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held
positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of
interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these
transactions.

The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants
made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's
Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share
price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never
post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to
make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to
maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.
Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband
business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in
financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing
arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,
its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's
finances from its investors and the market, further artificially
inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially
inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482
million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of
the above practices.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is
represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.  Our firm, with offices
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years of
experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions
involving financial fraud. For more information about Kaplan Fox &

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

                        # # #

Once we have a buyer, subject to their approval, I would like to offer Broker Client contracts to the existing Brokers, with the first x months free with no obligation to continue (but hopefully they will, and will pay us). I think this will help us to rebuild volumes.

Please let me know if you disagree.

Dave
