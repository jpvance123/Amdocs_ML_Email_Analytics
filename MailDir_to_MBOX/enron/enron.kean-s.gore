Voters Hear a Dull Gore, So Aides Sharpen Message
By Ceci Connolly
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, May 19, 2000; Page A06
NASHVILLE, May 18 -- Vice President Gore's top political strategists met
here for more than three hours today in a fresh effort to sharpen a
campaign that has ceded much of the spring to George W. Bush.
High on the agenda, according to consultants and officials in the
session, was a debate over new television ads and how to bring more
logic to the vice president's travel schedule, so that what he is saying
and where he is saying it do not appear random. "We need to make sure
our message and travel make sense," said one participant.
On Wednesday night, Gore spent a few hours before the cameras in a union
hall here with his admakers Bill Knapp and Carter Eskew, as they
continue fine-tuning commercials to be aired by the Democratic National
Committee between now and the August convention.
The DNC is preparing to sign an advertising contract with Knapp, Eskew
and other Gore top media consultants, said party spokeswoman Jenny
Backus.
Sources in Washington said today the party could easily spend $10
million over the next three months indirectly promoting Gore and other
Democratic candidates, although no firm budget has been set. From August
1995 to July 1996, the DNC and state Democratic committees ran $45
million worth of issue ads, party officials said today.
Gore campaign officials confirmed that for several weeks they have
test-marketed ads, many of them biographical spots aimed at
reintroducing Gore to a public that continues to have an ill-defined,
somewhat unfavorable impression of him. The DNC also has studied focus
groups to determine the best lines of attack against the presumptive GOP
nominee.
More broadly, the Gore team is struggling to seize back the agenda after
watching the Texas governor dominate the airwaves with proposals on
housing, education, health care and Social Security. Some Gore aides
argued that a turnaround began this week with the vice president's
response to Bush's proposal to privatize Social Security. "If you had
asked me a week ago, I would have said things were much worse," said one
staff member here. "But I think Bush has made a big mistake with that
proposal."
Addressing 10,000 retirees in Orlando on Wednesday, Gore gave one of his
most forceful, cogent speeches since locking up the Democratic
nomination in March. His advisers hope that methodical critique of
Bush's Social Security plan offers a blueprint for refocusing his
candidacy and boosts his lagging poll numbers.
"This was one of the first times since the end of the primaries we had
direct engagement on an issue voters care about," said one campaign
aide. "Both the candidate and the operation perform better when there is
something to compare to and we have a mission or task at hand."
One longtime Gore aide said the vice president was "warming up" to the
Social Security debate, reveling in the complex details of the program
and its broad scope. "Finally, a presidential issue," this person said.
Yet the campaign continued today to debate how much time Gore should
devote to attacking Bush rather than selling himself. Several Gore
advisers say they are lining up more "surrogates" to handle the Bush
critique so that Gore can carry a more positive message.
Today's high-level session was the second of new weekly meetings called
by campaign chairman Tony Coelho aimed in part at consolidating power at
the headquarters here. Many Gore allies have grumbled in recent weeks
about three competing power centers--here, at the White House and aboard
Air Force Two. In addition to Knapp, consultants Tad Devine, Michael
Whouley and Elaine Kamarck flew to Nashville for the session. Coelho is
moving the scheduling staff, led by Lisa Berg, to Nashville and has
asked Devine to spend two to three days a week here.
Gore has salted the DNC with several top advisers, including Whouley,
who will run the party, Knapp, who helped coordinate the 1996
advertising, and Laura Quinn, who is leaving the office of the vice
president to oversee the DNC communications shop.
DNC lawyers are finalizing the legal and financial details on a
consulting contract with a new company that will include principals from
three Democratic firms: Squier, Knapp, Dunn; Shrum, Devine and Donilon;
and Century Media (which is composed of several of the same Gore
consultants).

I met with Sally Painter to discuss our Gore 2000 strategy.  From this 
meeting, Sally drafted the attached action plan with the following near-term 
action items:

1) She suggests that we draft 1-2 page issue briefs on our signature policy 
issues.  I suggested 4 policy areas on which Enron has unique experience:  
electricity deregulation, e-commerce (trading), energy services, and 
broadband.  We spoke about this at a DC staff meeting and we set a mid-June 
deadline for the completion of these papers...of course with input from all.

2) We have set June 13 as the date for the Enron business outreach dinner.  
We need to decide if we want to do it in DC or Houston.  We also need to 
decide if we want to bring in our colleagues from different companies or 
associations to attend this dinner.  Sally suggested we try to bring in 8-10 
senior executives from our industry(ies).  

3) We need to set a date to go to Gore 2000 in Nashville to meet the 
working-level policy staff.  I will ask our respective support staff to 
schedule this.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks - Chris

?    Gore focuses on Social Security
?    Gore meets with South African President Thabo Mbeki
?    The NRA guns for the presidency
?    Houston Chronicle columnist Donald Kaul on Bush's Texas Leadership

GORE FOCUSES ON SOCIAL SECURITY, CHINA TRADE

Speaking in Washington today, Al Gore called for Social Security reform
that preserves the basic guarantee of retirement security.  The Gore
plan
will keep Social Security solvent through at least 2050, while Bush is
pushing a risky privatization scheme.  Under the Bush plan, poor
investment
choices by some individuals or a downturn in the stock market could
force
taxpayers to bailout those who lost money.

GORE MEETS WITH SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI

At a State Department luncheon, Al Gore met with South African President
Thabo Mbeki to discuss trade, the AIDS epidemic, and other concerns with
the African subcontinent.  Gore has proposed strengthening economic
engagement with Africa, which will lead to greater prosperity and
international security.

George Bush, however, takes a dim view of Africa, stating Africa
"doesn't
fit into the national strategic interests, as far as I can seen them."
[PBS
"NewsHour" 2/16/00]

THE NRA GUNS FOR THE PRESIDENCY

Meeting in Charlotte this weekend, Charlton Heston fired up the faithful
with fear and belligerence, telling Al Gore and other "divisive forces"
(gun safety advocates) that they could have his guns when they take them
"from my cold dead hands."

Wayne LaPierre, NRA Executive VP, attacked the Million Mom March,
instead
calling last week's rally of concerned parents, the "Misled Mom March."

Reaffirming that Governor Bush is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NRA,
top
officials declared they would throw all of the group's resources behind
the
Texas Governor.

HOUSTON CHRONICLE QUESTIONS BUSH'S LEADERSHIP

On Saturday, Houston Chronicle columnist Donald Kaul questioned Bush's
leadership, explaining "he has spent his life being rescued for his
family's rich friends from one failed business deal after another."

Among Kaul's criticisms of Mr. Bush:

Texas ranks near the tops of the charts in every bad category:
?    poverty rates, teen pregnancies, people without insurance, air
pollution, executions
Texas ranks near the bottom in all the good categories:
?    the environment, public health, parks and recreation, highways and
support for the arts

The one place where Bush has shown leadership is in working tirelessly
to
cut state taxes of the well-to-do.
?    He has protected the oil refiners which dump 1 million tons of
pollution into the Texas air annually
?    He pushed a $1.2 billion property tax cut, despite the fact that
Texas
schools are starved for cash

?    Bush's Social Security plan would hurt women
?    Required Reading: NYT Herbert ? "Are You Feeling Lucky?"

BUSH'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN WOULD HURT WOMEN

?    Women Would Be the "Largest Group of Losers" Under Privatization.
John Mueller, the Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of Lehrman
Bell
Mueller Cannon, Inc. and former adviser to Rep. Jack Kemp, testified
before
the House Social Security Subcommittee that "the largest group of losers
from 'privatizing' Social Security would be women.  This is true for
women
in all birth-years, all kinds of marital status, all kinds of
labor-market
behavior, and all income levels."

?    Privatization Plans Exacerbate the Already Unequal Distribution of
Retirement Benefits.  According to the statement of Jane Ross, Director
of
Income Security issues at the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO),
Social
Security reform plans that incorporate private accounts exacerbate the
already unequal distribution of retirement benefits under Social
Security.
["Social Security Reform: Implications for the Financial Well-Being of
Women," Statement of Jane L. Ross, GAO, 4/10/97]

?    Privatization Plans a Threat to Women's Long-Term Security.
Privatization would transform today's  guaranteed retirement benefits
into
a risky program that could threaten women's retirement security, since
women are more likely to rely on Social Security for their primary
source
of retirement benefits.

?    Women rely on Social Security because
(1)  half of all women work in jobs that don't offer pensions;
(2)  women retirees with pensions receive half the average pensions
benefits that men collect;
(3)  nearly three out of four women earn less than $30,000 a year. Women

"Social Security Privatization," National Committee to
     Preserve Social Security and Medicare, "Women and Retirement
Security," www.ssa.gov]

HERBERT FROM TODAY'S NYT: DO YOU FEEL LUCKY?

Bob Herbert today deconstructed the various arguments for why Bush's
privatization scheme is too risky.

1) Even his chief economic advisor doesn't trust the market:


"Mr. Lindsey, who strongly favors Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax
cut
and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus, has warned
his
private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to
a
recession. He said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he
would
be able "to sleep at night."


Mr. Bush told the nation that the key to saving Social Security
retirement
benefits was to allow working Americans to invest a portion of their
Social
Security taxes in the very same stock market that Mr. Lindsey, at the
moment, wants no part of."


2) Herbert also questioned Bush's motives, noting that Bush's Wall
Street
contributors would make out like bandits under his plan.


"There is, however, a group of guaranteed winners under Mr. Bush's plan
--
the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been
funneling
many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of Mr. Bush and other
politicians, just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions
of
dollars in Social Security taxes their way.


Everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this
welfare scheme for the not-so-idle rich.


3) He explained the chronology of Republicans trying to do away with
Social
Security


"Face it, the Republicans have had it in for Social Security since its
inception. The historian William Manchester wrote about the G.O.P.'s
desperate efforts in 1936 to block its creation: "On radio spots, actors
hired by the Republican National Committee revealed in shocked tones
that
each man would be given a number -- as though there were any other way
to
keep track of Social Security accounts -- and perpetrated the hoax that
people would be fingerprinted."


When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1946, party leaders
called
for the repeal of Social Security. And nearly four decades later,
Governor
Bush's fellow Texan, Senator Phil Gramm, could be quoted as follows on
the
question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly:


"They are 80-year-olds. Most people don't have the luxury of living to
be
80 years old, so it's hard for me to feel sorry for them."

GORE CHALLENGES BUSH TO SOCIAL SECURITY DEBATE AT AARP CONFERENCE IN
ORLANDO

Addressing approximately 10,000 seniors at the AARP's Biennial
Convention,
Al Gore today challenged George W. Bush to hold a debate, "as soon as
possible," on their competing Social Security proposals. Gore has called
for Social Security reform "based not on stock market speculation, but
on
fiscal responsibility and debt reduction." Bush is pushing the partial
privatization of Social Security, but has provided no specific details.

BUSH WOULD COMPLETELY PRIVATIZE  SOCIAL SECURITY

George Bush has revealed that his "secret plan" for Social Security is
an
attempt to completely dismantle and privatize the 65-year system of
social
insurance, according to reports in the New York Times, the Associated
Press, and the Houston Chronicle.

The Chronicle reports that "Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush on Tuesday said his plan to create private savings accounts could
be
the first step toward a complete privatization of Social Security."

"It's going to take a while to transition to a system where personal
savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle,"
Bush
said. "This is a step toward a completely different world, and an
important
step."

Bush admits that the individual private accounts are but the first step
in
his larger plan to privatize the program.  This may be good for the
stockbrokers who have poured $3 million into his Presidential campaign,
but
it is a horrible deal for America.

BUSH PLAN PANNED IN THE PRESS

Bush's privatization plan has come under fire from responsible
journalists
and editorial pages across the country.

A New York Daily News editorial writes:
"On the future of Social Security, the presidential candidates have
offered
stark choices. Bush would destroy the program; Gore would save it. Easy
choice."

Paul Krugman addresses the current concern about the stock market being
overvalued at present:
"If you think that stocks are currently overpriced, this [the Bush]
proposal sounds like a recipe for disaster: it will encourage workers to
buy stocks at exactly the wrong time -- eventually leading to an even
worse
Social Security crisis, as the government finds itself under intense
pressure to bail out the baby boomers."

TEXAS ALTERNATIVE TO SOCIAL SECURITY HURTS RETIREES

The Baltimore Sun today revealed that three Texas counties which opted
out
of the Social Security system in the early 1980s in favor of private
investments.  According to the Sun, many of the counties' 3,000
employees ?
especially low- to middle-income workers ? will actually earn less money
than if they had stuck with Social Security.

While wealthier workers might have done better under privatization,
middle
and low-wage workers did significantly worse.  According to a GAO
report, a
low-wage County employee working for 35 years would earn $1,125 a month
under Social Security, but as little as $542 under the privatized plan.

So much for Bush's plan to help poorer Americans.

>  AL GORE'S JOURNEY A Boyhood Divided
>  A Boy's Life In and Out of the Family Script
>  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER
>  The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he
> died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: "Son, always
> do right. Always do right." His father, the senator, felt he had
> himself done right a lot of the time, and reliably kept after his son
> to follow suit.
>  After the vice president talked about that last conversation,
> though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two nights
> straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had tacked on
> a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in part for the
> benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books. This time, nobody
> came right out and accused Mr. Gore himself of tweaking the dialogue.
>  Even the rawest and most intimate moments in his life are now
> widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign
> strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert
> and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death.
>  That perception has clearly become a political problem for the
> vice president.
>  Gov. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests that Mr. Gore is
> a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every remark is now
> fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently said he had once
> dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered if he could prove
> it. Had anyone ever heard that story before?
>  The questions are about more than Mr. Gore's assertions about
> the Internet and "Love Story." What in his life was scripted and what
> was real? Could even he know the difference? Where did his parents'
> hopes end and his own begin? And do you only get credit for hosing out
> hog parlors if you did it without an agenda?
>  But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Mr. Gore's
> life, perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the
> material that is the most widely doubted is also the most demonstrably
> true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in Tennessee. He did work
> hard on the farm there -- so hard, in fact, that the hired help felt
> sorry for him, and thought his father should ease up.
>  In the same way, some of what is generally assumed about Mr.
> Gore's life is not true: he did not, for example, live in luxury back
> in Washington during the school year.
>  Mr. Gore's parents were both famously frugal and were not well
> off until after their son had grown and after the senator's political
> career had ended. Though they sent their children to exclusive schools
> and provided such social necessities as ballroom dancing lessons for
> their son, they also dressed him in a cousin's hand-me-downs and lived
> in a hotel because it was owned by a relative who gave them a break on
> the rent.
>  Some summers, the Gores had to pack up their four-room suite and
> put their belongings in storage so the place could be sublet while
> they were in Tennessee. And Al shared a bedroom with his sister,
> Nancy, who was 10 years older, both before and after her college
> years.
>  Part of the reason that the contours of Mr. Gore's unusual
> upbringing are not better known, however, is that he himself has
> worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his
> childhood -- the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him the
> most good politically. The problem, for him, is the scenes from the
> past that portray Mr. Gore sympathetically at the expense of his
> hard-driving parents.
>  They suggest an emotionally neglected boy forced to bear the
> weight of enormous adult expectations, and Mr. Gore, who is fiercely
> protective of his 87-year-old mother and the memory of his father,
> categorically balks at that.
>  For a time, a decade ago, after his unsuccessful 1988
> presidential campaign and his son's near-fatal car accident the next
> year, Mr. Gore himself seemed determined to explore the meaning of his
> own life story.
>  He made a serious study of family dysfunction -- the subtext of
> his 1992 environmental manifesto, "Earth in the Balance" -- and passed
> out copies of Alice Miller's "Drama of the Gifted Child," a book about
> how narcissistic parents can leave their high-achieving children cut
> off from their own feelings and hazy on just what they want, other
> than to make Mom and Dad proud. Back then, friends said, he was
> absorbed by the need to figure things out, to emerge from his father's
> shadow. To decide.
>  But today, Mr. Gore seems nothing if not decided. He does want
> to be president, and if he can never really know exactly how much of
> that want began with his parents, his current attitude seems to be: So
> what? "One of the oldest plots in the human story is child follows
> parent," he said recently, with what sure seemed like authentic
> boredom. And looking back on his early years did not seem so very
> difficult.
>  In a series of interviews about his life, he was relaxed and
> appeared at peace with the past. He frankly described a childhood in
> which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of continuing
> political calculations -- maybe the same way writers often end up
> milking their families for material. When he got in trouble for
> throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore farm when he was
> 12, for example, his father made him send letters of apology to a
> number of trucking companies. "That was also an election year, I
> believe," he remarked wryly. But, he made clear, it was also just a
> kid's life.
>  From the Farm and the City
>  "I was conceived in Tennessee," Mr. Gore began, drawling for
> effect, in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole
> biographical exercise.
>  Though his political opponents have successfully portrayed him
> as a pure-bred Washington creature, with only photo-op moments in the
> heartland, he did have a life there, on the family farm, and by all
> accounts a more intense emotional connection to that place than to the
> nation's capital.
>  His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his
> time with adults -- important adults, in whose presence he was
> expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very
> least, where Al Gore wished he had grown up.
>  His buddies in Tennessee certainly considered Carthage, the
> small community on the Cumberland and the Caney Fork Rivers, where the
> Gores spent summers and holidays, as his true home. "There were not a
> lot of kids around the Fairfax," the Embassy Row hotel where the Gores
> lived while in Washington, "so he could not wait to get back home,"
> said Steve Armistead, Al Gore's closest childhood friend, and a good
> pal still.
>  "I went up there" when Mr. Gore was in high school "and the
> friend he had in the Fairfax was a bellhop," Mr. Armistead said.
> "There were all these dignitaries, but not much for a kid. There was a
> dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around Washington much
> when he could have been in Carthage, and that's where he got his
> values, working on the farm and growing up around Smith County
> people."
>  Of course, Mr. Gore is the product of both Washington and
> Tennessee -- and of the very fact of having grown up in two places,
> with two groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He
> was born in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1
> until he was 4, while his father ran for the Senate, and then moved
> between the two places until college.
>  This back and forth set him slightly apart from those around
> him, in season and out, and made him tough to figure.
>  Even his sense of humor is a hybrid, a little bit corny with
> flashes of sarcasm.
>  Mr. Gore himself seems to feel that his split-screen view of the
> world was a gift, at least in the end.
>  "Even though I spent more time each year in Washington,
> Tennessee was home," he said. "Now I'm sure that part of that was me,
> as a kid, absorbing my parents' insistence on the political reality of
> their lives, that they were representing Tennessee in Washington. I'm
> sure I picked up a lot of that as a child. But it was more than that."
>
>  He described Tennessee as a place where "the human relationships
> were much warmer," and where he had his dearest friends.
>  "I think I learned a great deal from the, forgive the word, the
> parallactic view provided by growing up in two places," he says now,
> "because just as having two eyes gives you depth perception, having
> two homes allows you to see some things that stand out in relief when
> viewed from two different perspectives."
>  A Tennessee Work Ethic
>  Mr. Gore's father -- who also favored fancy words -- moved
> between two worlds, too, and for all his striving in Washington did
> not believe in leaving either Tennessee or his farm roots behind,
> ever, even after his career in politics ended.
>  And he and his wife thought that working on the farm would be
> good for their son, whom they told friends they hoped would be
> president one day. "It was expected from the time he was little," said
> James Fleming, a Nashville doctor and friend of Nancy Gore's, who for
> a time served as the Gore family physician. It was not so much that
> the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add just the right touch of
> "log cabin" to his r,sum,, family friends said, as that they simply
> felt it would toughen him up and give him a proper work ethic.
>  "His daddy used to get him up about 6 o'clock in the morning,"
> said Mattie Lucie Payne, who worked for the Gores as a housekeeper for
> more than 40 years. "And Al would say, 'Daddy, we have men working,'
> and his daddy would say, 'I know, and you go on down and help them.' "
>
>  He baled hay, cut tobacco and cleaned out hog parlors along with
> the hired help.
>  But the senator also seemed to revel in assigning his son some
> of the most backbreaking tasks, like clearing 20 hilly acres with a
> hand ax.
>  "He'd drive him pretty hard," said Gordon Thompson, a friend
> whose family used to live on the Gore farm, back when his own father
> worked for the senator.
>  But then, he drove himself hard, too. Even at 4-H camp, as a
> 9-year-old, he asked to be given the heavy-lifting kitchen duty
> usually reserved for 13- and 14-year-olds. "He was the only camper I
> ever had volunteer for K-P," said Jerry Cole, the local 4-H agent.
>  For several weeks every summer after school let out, but before
> his parents could get away from Washington, Mr. Thompson said, Al
> would stay with them in a house with no indoor plumbing. "He never
> complained," Mr. Thompson said. "I think he was always happiest on the
> farm."
>  Always, he was serious. "He pretty much acted the same way when
> he was 13 as he does now," said Donna Armistead, Steve Armistead's
> sister and Mr. Gore's first real girlfriend, for several years,
> beginning when he was an extremely confident 13-year-old and she was
> 16.
>  "He was a terrific listener," recalled Ms. Armistead, now a
> nurse and divorced mother of two. And not just to her, she said. He
> would pay attention to the old folks at her grandparents' grocery
> store, and hold his grandmother's hand in the nursing home for long
> stretches several times a week.
>  Mr. Gore's own mother "was not very touchy," Ms. Armistead said,
> adding, "When he came in she just wouldn't come running to hug him."
>  She said his father used an entirely different voice when he
> talked with Al.
>  "He'd talk with authority," she said.
>  And nobody, the way Ms. Armistead remembers it, gave him any
> breaks for being a senator's son.
>  Once, after Mr. Gore and Ms. Armistead had done a particularly
> hard job on the farm, the senator told him to take her out for a meal
> at a certain cafe. "We were so thrilled," she remembered. "But after
> dinner Al gets up to the cash register and said, 'My dad said to
> charge it to him,' and the guy wouldn't do it."
>  The senator's tab was too long already.
>  "So I had to tell him I'd be right back, and go get the money
> from my mom," Ms. Armistead said.
>  A Touch of Mischief
>  Still, his time in Tennessee was not all boot camp and character
> building, and Mr. Gore did manage to have some unscripted fun. Mr.
> Thompson remembers his friend as "pranky," with a love of practical
> jokes that endures today.
>  One New Year's Eve, several of his friends said, their whole
> group was snowed in at the Gore farm, so Pauline Gore corralled all
> the girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boys in Al's room on the
> lower level. The senator, dressed in his bathrobe, sat sentry duty at
> the top of the stairs all night long, and every so often yelled
> downstairs to his son and the other boys, who were busy sharing one
> bottle of beer.
>  At first light, Ms. Armistead heard a knock on the window,
> looked out and saw Al and his buddies, who had slipped out a window
> and climbed up onto the deck outside her room, where they were making
> snowmen in their underwear for the girls' benefit.
>  "Mr. Albert still thought he had everything under control," she
> said.
>  Her brother, Steve, describes a pretty mild teenage rebellion:
> "We did all the experimental things kids do. We'd sneak out at night
> and pick up Coke bottles off a front porch that probably were not
> ours, or go to the lake and maybe do a little water skiing at night
> that was not too smart, and occasionally have a party. We probably did
> a little bit of alcohol abuse."
>  But there were also times, even as a kid, when Mr. Gore flouted
> authority more directly. Once, while staying with the Thompsons, he
> heard that his father, who was away, was going to be giving a speech
> in Nashville, 55 miles east.
>  His parents, though, had decided that their son should not come
> to the event.
>  "He was little," 12 at most, Mr. Thompson said, "but Al went
> over to Carthage and caught the bus and went down there, still dressed
> for the farm. That didn't go over too well. His mom called and wanted
> to know where he was -- that was a biggie. My mom had to tell her he
> wasn't here. Today, you'd be worried about all kinds of things
> happening. But they were more concerned about him not being all
> cleaned up."
>  Like a lot of mothers, Pauline Gore always insisted publicly
> that her son was at all times the perfect boy.
>  But was she embellishing a little? At least at times, she
> apparently thought she had reason to worry.
>  Dr. Fleming said, "I remember Donna, this good-looking girl,
> running around the house, and Pauline saying, 'Ohmigod, she's going to
> get pregnant, I know it.' "
>  Mr. Gore was not shy about expressing affection for his
> girlfriend in front of his mother.
>  "I remember Pauline and I drove him to the airport one time,"
> said Ms. Armistead, "and he kissed her on the cheek and then he kissed
> me. I mean, he laid one on me, honey." 
>  Ms. Armistead says the two of them were lectured. "Miss Pauline
> said keep busy, don't think about sex, enjoy your time together but
> always have something in mind to do," she said. "Cold showers and lots
> of exercise."
>  But she also says Mrs. Gore need not have worried. "Sex was sex
> even then," Ms. Armistead said, "but Al and I both had goals."
>  Finding a Role Model
>  Today, the vice president seems to enjoy looking back on the
> benign pleasures of the summers when he got to be a kid in Tennessee
> -- skinny-dipping with Mr. Thompson in a cattle trough or hypnotizing
> chickens, which Mr. Gore says is "a little-known farm skill passed
> down from adolescent wizard to adolescent wizard."
>  Mr. Gore also situates himself politically in Tennessee, as heir
> not only to his father but to Cordell Hull, whom he describes as "the
> model for public service in our part of the country." Mr. Hull floated
> logs down the Cumberland River with Mr. Gore's grandfather, settled in
> Carthage and became the congressman in the seat the Gore father and
> son later held.
>  An ardent free-trader, Mr. Hull won the Nobel Peace Prize for
> his role in founding GATT, now the World Trade Organization, and was
> secretary of state in World War II. "But before that he was a judge on
> the circuit, and in 10 counties there, the picture above the judge's
> chair in the courtroom is neither George Washington, Thomas Jefferson
> nor Franklin Roosevelt," Mr. Gore said, with the greatest possible
> reverence. "It's Cordell Hull to this day."
>  Asked to name the most important things he had inherited from
> his parents, Mr. Gore talked for a long time about his father and his
> father's ideals. But the first thing he said in answer to the question
> was this:
>  "Some of what people perceive as the stiffness and formality I
> sometimes lapse into comes in part from my father's habit of trying to
> ensure that he always presented a dignified appearance to live up to
> the position he felt deserved dignity.
>  "People who saw him on the stump and playing the fiddle find
> that ironic because they don't remember the formal bearing that he had
> in most of his appearances. He had a capacity to enjoy humor and music
> and friendship, and he also felt the need to present himself as a
> senator in a formal and dignified way."
>  Those who knew the senator say his climb from poverty was still
> too fresh and stereotypes of Tennessee hillbillies with dirt under
> their fingernails still too prevalent for him to feel he could afford
> the luxury of letting his guard down in certain public settings.
>  His father "always raised cattle, he always farmed, he always
> found relaxation, even in Washington, by going to the farm and working
> with cattle," the vice president said.
>  "But he became a statesman," too, Mr. Gore said. "I've often
> thought in my father's persona he continued to manifest both."
>  His friends feel sure Mr. Gore would move back to Carthage if,
> as Mr. Thompson delicately put it, "worse comes to worst." The vice
> president laughed at that, but agreed. "Well, I'll retire in Carthage
> for sure," he said. "You know, I hope that's many years from now."
>  One thing that still strikes all his Tennessee friends as odd,
> though, is that through all the time he spent there growing up he
> never spoke a word about Washington. And he absolutely refused to wear
> any of the neatly folded T-shirts his mother had packed for him --
> T-shirts emblazoned with the name of his prep school, St. Albans.
>  "He probably thought we would think he was trying to act like he
> was better than the rest of us," guessed his old friend Edward Blair.
>  But Mr. Gore, who had his boots up on the table in front of him
> as he talked, snorted when he heard this.
>  "I guess maybe they were thinking that Washington is such a neat
> place," he said, "that I would naturally want to tell them all about
> the great things there."
>  Few Comforts of Home
>  If the Fairfax was a cold place to grow up, it was not because
> there was no family close by.
>  The owner, Grady Gore, was a cousin of the senator's. Louise
> Gore, one of Grady's daughters, lived in the hotel. Her sister, Mary
> Gore Dean, moved in, too, after her husband died in a plane crash. For
> a while, their brother Jimmy Gore and his family were on the premises,
> as well. When they moved, it was just down the block.
>  But the vice president is not sentimental about his time there.
> "I came to love the farm," he said. "The hotel I never loved."
>  The senator's correspondence makes clear that he and his family
> were there because the price was right. The Gores looked for a house
> in Washington for years, but never found anything they felt they could
> afford.
>  And one thing that seems to bother Mr. Gore -- far more, in
> fact, than the idea that his 52 years add up to something that is not
> so much a life as a story line -- is the perception that "I was in
> this luxury apartment eating room service, sort of like Eloise."
>  Asked if his younger days in Washington were lonely, he sighed.
>  "Oh, no," he said. "I mean I had good friends and I had my
> sister. And it's not as if I didn't have my parents. They went out
> frequently, and every six years they had a hard campaign, but they
> were great and loving parents, and the times when they were pulled
> away I had Nancy and my friends. I wasn't left alone with my
> thoughts."
>  He got pretty creative about making his own fun, sometimes
> upending all the furniture in the living room to construct an
> elaborate fort. But activity was supposed to be purposeful. "His dad
> was a very, very proud man and believed that old Cordell Hull thing of
> you're put on earth for a purpose and it's to improve the condition of
> life," said Mr. Gore's cousin, Mark Gore, who lived down the block.
>  (His cousin also remembers Senator Gore teaching him to swim by
> throwing him into a pool when he was 4, while Al, who was 7, looked
> on, laughing.)
>  From fourth grade on, young Al attended St. Albans, the
> Episcopal boys' prep school on the grounds of the National Cathedral,
> where he did well but was not, according to friends, especially happy.
>
>  Throughout high school, he wrote his Tennessee girlfriend, Ms.
> Armistead, twice a day, and called her on a pay phone every Saturday
> night.
>  Two of Mr. Gore's closest Washington friends recall that while
> Al Gore was the focus of his parents' fondest hopes, it was his
> free-spirited, rebellious sister, Nancy, who took more of their
> energy. "The general topic of conversation over there was what
> outrageous thing Nancy did this week," said one of these friends. "She
> got a lot of attention and Al was kind of an afterthought, because he
> never misbehaved."
>  For him, the best times were those spent throwing a ball around
> with his father at Grady Gore's estate in Potomac, Md. "He had some
> cattle from the Tennessee farm brought up there," Mr. Gore said,
> smirking like he knows that sounds kind of crazy. "And a lot of times
> on weekends we'd go up there and he'd work with the cattle and I'd

> someone walked by, "he'd duck back into the office until they passed"
> because "it wasn't very dignified," the son recalled. When Al Gore had
> real ballgames, though, it was his sister, not his father, who would
> come.
>  More often, his father took him to Senate hearings. He sat

> would the new roads be? Green or blue for the road signs? As a kid,
> Mr. Gore followed these developments avidly, keeping track of the
> miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the
> Yankees' box scores.
>  "He also took me on the Senate floor, even though he wasn't

> invited to come up front to meet the vice president, Richard M. Nixon,
> who was presiding that day: "He put me on his knee and was very nice
> to me, and the experience forever after deprived me of the more
> sublime pleasures of Nixon hatred."
>  Once, Mr. Gore's father let his son listen in on an extension

Steve: Per your instructions, Chris and I met and discussed your comments 
last week regarding the Fontheim proposal to provide representation to Enron 
at the rate of $10,000 per month plus expenses (these should be quite 
minimal) from date of execution through the balance of the year.

Claude Fontheim is well known in Washington and did serve in a trade capacity 
early in the Clinton Administration. Chris and I have know two of his 
operatives Sally Painter and Ken Levinson for several years. Sally was the 
deputy director of the DOC business liason office and later with Tenneco and 
Ken was legislative director to Senator Rockefeller. We believe they have a 
good reputation and provide professional representation of the highest 
quality.

While their strength as Chris and I see it is there relationships in the 
Clinton-Gore White House, they are particularly close to the New Democrats 
(trade and commerce supporters in Congress) and have good ties into the 
environmental community. They have made various suggestions to us in the past 
and offered advice both of which have been useful to Enron. Therefore, while 
we have been discussing their value in our desire to have good ties with the 
Gore organization which they have, Chris and I also see value they can bring 
to other issues of importance to Enron including the electricity 
restructuring legislation.

We recommend them and await your decision.

Joe
