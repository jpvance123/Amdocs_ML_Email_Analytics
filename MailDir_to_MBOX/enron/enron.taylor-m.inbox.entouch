United Way 2001

As of 11:00 am this morning, EWS had reached $1,257,644.44 in pledges, whic=
h is 98.58% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000 and our participation rate i=

ron, as a whole, remain short of our goals, so the online United Way pledgi=

Although contracted as one $320MM project, the work had to be managed as fo=

 facilities, being contained entirely within PDVSA's existing live plant, h=

ion, the site was under constant threat of disruptive action by very vocal =

Manager, Tony Burke, they were shut-down only 25% as much as three adjacent=
 major projects .The secondary sites, at Santa Barbara and San Joaquin, con=
tained two grassroots 400MMSCFD Propane Extraction Plants. Not only did the=
ir remoteness cause significant logistical problems for equipment delivery,=
 but also both had significant labour relations problems peculiar to their =
own locations. San Joaquin suffered many days of Force Majeure delay caused=
 by the disruptive action by several local community groups protesting lack=
 of work.

Despite all the impediments of the local labour, logistics, and the usual c=
ustoms clearance issues, the construction was essentially finished on sched=
ule.

Commissioning and start-up brought new challenges with erratic feedstock qu=

On 8 August, 2001 Enron's shipping desk bought a Digital Bankruptcy Swap (D=

desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty.  When the leve=

"We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order =
to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us," said P=

we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning cu=

Coal and Emissions Trading

The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EOL as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of  bringing synfuel on EOL is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing while reducing execution risk.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com.

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 "This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000," says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  "We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities."

GasMarktFax Stirs "Trouble" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  "Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs," said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  "However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice," Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland," declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland," adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible."

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: "We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices."

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

West Power
On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.

News from the Global Flash

EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal
EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.

Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: "Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia."

German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory 
Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the "heart land" of Germany. 

Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive
On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.   Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.  True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.

Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'

The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  "The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located," explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.  "Other "Raider Class" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports."  

While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!   Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

EIM Trivia
Enron Industrial Markets currently owns two paper mills - Garden State Paper in Garfield, NJ and Papiers Stadacona in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.  The combined annual newsprint capacity is 620,000 tonnes, which roughly translates to 137 billion square feet.  If you assume that the average width of a newspaper page is 25 inches, then this translates into Enron producing enough newsprint in a year to get us to Jupiter and half-way back to Earth.  Papiers Stadacona also produces approximately 100,000 tonnes per year of directory paper.  This translates into roughly 50 million telephone and trade directory books.  That's a lot of phone numbers!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 

Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading 
The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal.  

Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative 
ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative.

This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay.

A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility.

The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team.   

eSource 
eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded "Spending Wisely on Private Hubs", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>.  

Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events.

Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees.  

Enron Freight Markets 
EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal.

Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant.  Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK.  

John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility.  Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas.  Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit.  Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days.  EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly.

Enron Industrial Markets
The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities.  The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers.

Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly.  As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts.   Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps.      


IN THE NEWS
HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. 
Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman.
"Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman," Lay said. "In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective 26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played key roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe."

Enron Wholesale Services Best Practice Tips
Skytel is Enron's Preferred Vendor for Paging Devices
Included in the Skytel agreement are numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.  Enron also receives special discount incentives through year-end 2001, such as 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases and trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units.  Note:  Employees presently using both pagers and cell phones are encouraged to consolidate to one device by eliminating pagers and utilizing cell phones only.  Negotiations are currently underway to determine the preferred cell phone provider for Enron.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
EGM's global crude and products group closed its largest trades to date wit=
h EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EOT) on June 29,2001.  Enron Gas Liquid=
s, Inc. ("EGLI") is the counterparty to a 10-year toll conversion agreement=
 and a 10-year storage capacity agreement that also provides transportation=
.  The toll conversion agreement calls for EGLI to deliver a combination of=
 feedstocks (methanol, natural gas, and normal butane) to be converted into=
 various offtake products, primarily MTBE.=20

As a part of the 10-year conversion agreement, EGLI has the option to conve=
rt the facility into an Iso Octane plant.  The option to convert is EGLI's =
sole and exclusive right.  In addition, the call helps to mitigate the regu=
latory risk associated with the MTBE market.

Prior to the close of the 10-year conversion and storage capacity agreement=
s, Enron's corporate development group organized the sale of the hydrocarbo=
n-processing complex in Morgan's Point, Texas, and a liquids pipeline grid =
system to EOTT for approximately $120 million.  The asset sale was predicat=
ed on the agreements to be entered into between EGLI and EOTT. =20

These combined agreements represent EGM's largest transaction to date.

EGM Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals welcomes Andrew Hill to the Houston office for a six-month=
 assignment from London.  Andrew joined EGM in March as a Senior Specialist=
 and has been instrumental in developing the growing range of EGM Fundament=
als publications such as Critical Mass and The Week Ahead.  In Houston, And=
rew will be working with Richard Lassander to manage analysis of the crude =
and products markets.  Prior to joining EGM, Andrew worked as a management =
consultant specializing in Latin America with Wood McKenzie.

EGM Fundamentals has begun analysis of domestic freight markets.  This new =
effort, managed by Jeff Andrews, is being coordinated with Matt Arnold's fo=
rward trading group in Enron Freight Markets (EFM).  Current analysis is fo=
cused on over-the-road trucking, following the initial commercial focus of =
EFM, and the development of diesel hedging strategies.  Related projects in=
clude modeling the seasonality of trucking demand and diesel fuel consumpti=
on and forecasting on-road diesel prices.  Within the next three to four we=
eks, analysis will begin of the intermodal freight network.  Interested par=
ties should watch the EGM Fundamentals intranet site (<http://egmfundy.corp=
.enron.com>) for updates.

East Power Origination
The Sand Hill Energy Center in Austin was dedicated on Wednesday, July 11th=
 at 10:00 am.  The $93.7 million project is the first peaking facility of i=
ts kind in Texas to be constructed with selective catalytic reduction pollu=
tion control equipment that reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission rate =
by 80 percent.  NOx emissions from the units are 5 parts per million (ppm),=
 which is considerably less than the amounts allowed by state and federal r=
egulations.  Congratulations to the development team!

IN THE NEWS

"For California to continue this bogus claim of $8.9 billion, I think just =
shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement," Enron spok=
esman Mark Palmer said. "They are just interested in creating a whipping po=
st. The last thing that the political leadership in California wants to do =
is take responsibility for the problem they created."  Houston Chronicle, J=
uly 10, 2001.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany=20
Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first ph=
ysical supply contract with an industrial customer.  The customer, based in=
 Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta=
king gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base=
 load.

In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co=
mpleted a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbe=
nt player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected=
 in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had=
 to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German=
y in order to close the gas supply deal.  "Although we are happy that we ha=
ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac=
tual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net=
work operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the neg=
otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor=
t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France," commented Carsten H=
aack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke a=
nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important el=
ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran=
sportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after =
Ruhrgas. "This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, =
especially in East Germany, " said Haack. "But more importantly, this deal =
will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo=
mers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network =
operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!" he added.

ETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont
Congratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL) for signing a serie=
s of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wi=
lton International.

A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two milli=
on tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plant=
s. New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies, and for the prov=
ision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance, secu=
rity and emergency response.

Paul Gavens, CEO of ETOL, said: "Securing an exclusive long-term supply agr=
eement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achi=
evement for ETOL. The new arrangements extend the terms of our current cont=
ract for steam and power to 2010, restructure the pricing arrangements and =
offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the =
operation of their respective assets."


Enron's Northernmost Partner!
Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger =
Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Var=
anger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partne=
rship will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and=
 the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperat=
ure risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to =
develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian mar=
ket generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second=
 such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.

This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationshi=
ps in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varange=
r has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As =
the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in coop=
eration with Russian partners to manage the water storage.=20

Wayne,

Corp. PR and IR were ok with the general content/wording of the Anker press release.  However, IR prefers not to have direct quotes from Enron in a press release issued by a third party, so given the short time frame we are operating in to receive release approval, we took out George McClellan's quote.  Attached please find a copy of the final document for you to share with Anker.  I also now forwarded it to Mike McConnell.  In the event I will receive any negative feedback from Mike over the weekend, I will leave you a message on your cellular phone (or if you prefer, at your office voice mail).  Over the weekend, please feel free to call me at home (713-572-8288) or on my cell phone (713-298-6523) with any further questions.  Again, thank you for your cooperation.

Increased liquidity in the prompt months has brought more players into the spot rail market. Traditionally a thin market in the OTC market, the coal group is capitalizing on increased interest by introducing several new EOL rail products. On the CSX rail line, there will be two 12,500 btu products with different sulfur contents - 1.2 pound (or compliance) and 1.6 pound. The CSX contract will be FOB rail in the Big Sandy or Kanawha rail districts. On the Norfolk Southern rail line there will be two similiar 12,500 btu products, however, FOB rail in the Thacker or Kenova rail districts. The coal group intends to bring these products on line within a week for the cash book, and hopefully extend them to the forward markets.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Gas TPA agreement signed in Spain
Some very good news just in from Spain.  Last week, Enron Espa?a Generaci?n=
 and Enagas reached a long-term agreement whereby Enagas will provide Enron=
 Espa?a Generaci?n with regasification and transport services of natural ga=
s of approximately 1,7bcm annually between Huelva and our planned combined =
cycle gas turbine plant at Arcos de la Frontera (Cadiz).  The services will=
 begin in 2004, a date that coincides with our planned schedule for commenc=
ement of operations for the plant.  Well done to all the team.

Enron launches derivatives for three new tanker freight routes in shipping =
market
Enron's tanker freight team has this past week increased their derivatives =
portfolio (freight futures or 'swaps' of monthly contracts up to four month=
s out) for three new tanker freight routes on EnronOnline. The tanker freig=
ht derivatives will be benchmarked against published indices for the three =
routes on the 'Baltic International' (BITRA) and International Independent =
Tanker Rate Assessment (IITRA) exchanges to help ship-owners (including oil=
 companies), charterers, traders and even banks with exposure to the shippi=
ng market, mitigate the volatility of the freight element of tanker voyages=
 traveling from Singapore to Japan (30,000 tonnes), the Caribbean to the US=
 Gulf (70,000 tonnes) and Rotterdam to New York (33,000 tonnes).  Derivativ=
es for the three routes will be managed out of the Singapore, Houston and L=
ondon offices respectively.  "Volatility of the tanker freight market has b=
een as high as 62% on some routes," explains Scott Moncrieff, Enron's direc=
tor of Liquids Freight Trading, based in London.  "This has increased the i=
mportance of freight in relative terms on most tanker routes"=20

"In nine months we have already traded more than 3 million tonnes of paper =
freight, with a value of more than USD 14 million on the existing 80,000 to=
nne Sullom Voe (North Sea) to Willemshaven (Germany) route, and we expect t=
o achieve similar levels of interest on our three new routes.  The tanker f=
reight market is estimated to be worth more than USD 15 billion annually, a=
nd with increased liquidity being brought to the sector because of more pla=
yers entering the market there's plenty of opportunity for us to build our =
business."

The tanker freight team is also very heavily involved in the physical chart=
ering of tanker vessels in Europe, The Americas, Arabian Gulf, Mediterranea=
n, Far East and US West Coast, utilizing both the spot shipping market and =
Enron-controlled 'time-charter' vessels.

Nordic Pre-Pay Deal
The Nordic origination team has closed their first municipality power pre-p=
ay deal in the last week. This is the first deal to be completed based on a=
 financing structure that Enron Nordic Energy negotiated with Den Norske Ba=
nk earlier this summer. The deal is an important reference for municipaliti=
es that are interested in raising cash without selling their ownership in l=
ocal power companies.

Steel Products
In March 2001 the European Steel Group commenced operations as an expansion=
 of the successful effort underway in North America.  The group offers both=
 physical and financial commodity grade steel products and serves as the on=
ly market-maker for a commodity market that is larger than that of crude oi=
l.  The mission is to introduce the concept of indexation and financial con=
tract to an industry where price transparency and risk management are virtu=
ally non-existent.  Physical and financial contracts for hot rolled and col=
d rolled steel are currently on offer via EnronOnline.  Interest from Europ=
ean producers and end-users is keen with the first financial transactions e=
xpected to close by the end of Q3.=20

Since the team's inception they have successfully completed transactions wi=
th counterparties in Kazakhstan, Egypt, and China amounting to nearly 50,00=
0 metric tonnes of steel. =20

Forest Products
Enron's European Forest Products group is now trading physical market pulp =
to complement the financial derivatives products already offered for the la=
st 2 years, increasing the volume under contract by 30%.=20

Over the past six months, the group has recruited physical pulp traders to =
handle its day-to-day physical pulp trading business.  "We have sourced lon=
g-term physical supplies of "market pulp" from around the world which will =
complement the financial derivative products we have already been offering,=
" explains Martin Holmes, Director of Enron's European Forest Product Opera=
tions.

By trading both physical and financial contracts, Enron is pioneering more =
creative pricing in the industry by offering physical and financial cash an=
d forward prices, as well as being the only market maker to quote longer da=
ted swaps.

The group is also actively looking at structured finance opportunities incl=
uding a number of inventory deals. These opportunities have arisen as the b=
enchmark pulp price for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) has fallen =
by 45% over the past 6 months, leaving producers with high levels of pulp i=
nventory in warehouses.

On 2nd July, the group launched the first standard contract for Bleached Eu=
calyptus (BEK) pulp on EnronOnline, and is actively marketing to industry b=
rokers to adopt the contract as the benchmark index for pricing. The contra=
ct meets the commodity specifications of the BEK contract on the London Pul=
pex futures exchange, where Enron is the only market maker for all pulp fut=
ures contracts offered.

Siebel provides these users with the ability to store all of their accounts, contacts, potential deals and activities in a common, shared repository.  In early August, Enron Freight Markets will follow EIM's lead and launch Siebel Episode II to their front-office personnel.  

Enron Global Strategic Sourcing, in collaboration with Enron Net Works, recently executed a two-year agreement with SkyTel Communications, Inc. to provide users with one- and two-way local and nationwide numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.

EA-Office of the Chairman
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described here.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.


IN THE NEWS

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp., EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday.

The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursing mergers or acquisition for now, according to Greg Piper.
