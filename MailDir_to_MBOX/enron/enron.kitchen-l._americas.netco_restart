The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Ryan is waffling.  I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north.   These weather guys need physcology treatement.   Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk.   I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out.
 
Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening.   With respect to fundies, I already have my guys working on this.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

Louise,

As you know, we were told during today's Integration Committee call that Marketing's and Legal's text changes for the
website would be accepted any time today. Following the call, however, I was told that the noon deadline was firm, but
we could make minor text changes on Thursday. Based on that information, we forwarded partial comments to Kal Shah by
noon. In a late afternoon email, I found out that we will not be able to complete our changes until perhaps five days
after the site goes live.

We appreciate the pressure and long hours people in Houston are putting into getting the site up and running. We applaud
their efforts and do not wish to add to their burden. I tell you this only to make you aware of our situation, should
any problems arise because of the unedited text. Hopefully, if anything does arise, problems can be easily and quickly
corrected.

Please call me at 212-713-8508 if you have any questions or if I can help you in any way.

Thank you,

Claudia Robinson
Director, Employee Communications, UBS Americas Inc.

John/ Louise -

I think this means that we will need someone from risk management from the old interest rate group.  Infinity is a seperate system from what we use for gas and power.  I would suggest Clara Carrington.  

Let me know if this is not an option,  so that Stacey and I can do some quick research and see what needs to be done.

Thanks,

Jeff

Subject:	RE: Interest Rates

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Tammy --

Janelle and I met this morning regarding the churn for ECS05/06 et al.

In order to be able to meet the deadline of next weekend, we will have to have all churns submitted no later than Monday, January 28 @ 2:00 pm. We will not be able to allow any adds/changes past that point. 

Should we be unable to meet the deadline at 2:00 on Monday we will need to look at pushing back a week. One option might be (if all churns aren't submitted on time) to move all non UBS people off of ECS 05 & 06 on the 2/1 weekend, and then "shuffle" every eon else the following

 Hello Louise.

The integration WEB site is:  http://energy.  To access this you will
need to go to the UBSW  intranet home page referred to as the

Hello Pat, Louise, Dave

The UBSW real estate department is reviewing the current/future lease
terms for UBSW Energy LLC, in Houston.  According to Brian Dugan, our
lead real estate guy on the bank side, the building owner has offered
a nine month lease to stay in the South Tower on the 5th and 6th
floors.  After the nine months we will be offered the option to sign
up for an additional 18 months but we could be moved down to floors 3
and 4.  Is this a significant issue?  I understand that the 3rd and
4th floor foot prints are similar to 5/6.

If UBSW Energy is willing to relocate to the North Tower, they can
get a lease for 5-9 years but this tower may be less suitable.  What
are the issues here?

The integration real estate team plans to meet this afternoon with
the Bank's outside legal firm we use for real estate issues.  We have
a target date of this Friday to try to resolve all real estate issues
in order to meet the DAY 0 legal integration date of 2/6/02.

Your thoughts please.

Mark

Pat,

Attached is a summary of key issues affecting commercial and operations groups from the UBS Warburg Energy side for your discussion with Mike Hutchins.

I am copying Louise and each of the people who provided input in preparing this list.

Note that there are many items being worked on which do not appear on the list - these are only the most pressing.

Dave

Tammie,
Many of the desks on 5 & 6 have items in/on them that need to be boxed up and labeled and put in storage. We need to have them cleaned up prior to moving new people to these locations ASAP.

Can you please help identify a task force?

Thanks,
Tammy

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The plan is to issue the closing announcement on
Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for when the website officially launches, which is
expected on Monday (2/11).

Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the new management. I need from Human Resources
confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There will also be internal publicity on the day the
website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
integration site.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,

Claudia

Reagan, Bill, Larry, and I got together to put together a draft business plan that can be applied to the Southeast and Midwest regions.  The schedule is probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  The plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and until we know VAR, capital, etc.

Mitch

Louise,

Thanks so much for your speedy reply. I will pass your comments on to Dave Walker in Media Relations.

I included Kevin because he is listed with you, Greg and John on a "management" slide. If there are others who should be
included on Greg's core management team for the announcement, please let me know who they are and their titles. Please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include Kevin. If there is an org chart, that might be helpful, too. It would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long.

Thanks again,

Claudia

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

(See attached file: UBSW Energy release draft.doc)
On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed
that sentence.
(See attached file: UBSenergycomreleasedraft.doc)
Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a
particular reason?

Thanks

Louise

   Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing
   the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
   transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The
   plan is to issue the closing announcement on
   Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for
   when the website officially launches, which is
   expected on Monday (2/11).

   Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media
   Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

   Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for
   Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
   global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the
   new management. I need from Human Resources
   confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In
   addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
   Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with
   Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
   posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There
   will also be internal publicity on the day the
   website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and
   intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
   integration site.

   Please let me know if you have questions.

   Thanks,

   Claudia

Louise et al

We have began the following initiatives to have a structuring function ready for operation within NETCO as well as other related issues to be addressed:

Structuring Model Capabilities - We are moving all of the existing gas and power structuring models into a directory to be transferred to NETCO at the appropriate time. We will need to provide the estate with formal documentation (from yourself and/or Jim Fallon) for the transfer of these assets into NETCO (per Vince Kaminski's request). These models have historically been property of the Research Group. We have initiated the process of transferring the ownership of this to a designated IT person within the NETCO organization.(See attached for more detail)
Deal Processes/Controls - Once Legal/Credit formalize the contract forms we will be using for NETCO, we should discuss a deal approval process to implement. I would assume the old ENA process would be the template we would follow with adjustments to be made for new corporate structure/ownership, appropriate approval levels of transactions,etc. Issue - Will there be a RAC-like group to provide overall deal documentation? I'm sure this issue will be addressed as transactions start to hit the radar and the collective owners of NETCO will sign off on a control process.
Back Office Execution Capability - Once the structuring models and the risk systems have been formally moved to the new IT enviroment, we will begin testing the models to the risk books to ensure valuation accuracy. We may want to talk about the reporting mechanisms from both the risk system and structuring models to include Cash Flow reporting tools in addition to MTM reporting. This may be a useful tool to front-end manage our cash position/exposure.

I've also attached a table with details of the above initiatives and estimated timelines. 

Please call me with questions.

Attached is the Govt & Reg Affairs Re-Start Plan for Netco.  As you know we are already making calls and preparing for the FERC power marketing certificate.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Georgeanne,

Attached below is Treasury's initial project plan for a full banking system replica for Netco.  As you will see we have estimated we can be up and running with basic wire functionality by 1/23/01 and a full system of checks, issuance files, ACH's and Workstation within 93 days.  We do reserve the right to amend and or clarify this plan as we have time to complete our due diligence on the full system requirements and the impact of the changes.  Currently the plan does not include the Citibanking installation which will be included as soon as possible and will not extend the project deadline.

 
Regards,

Marcus Pullicino

Louise

David has asked me to prepare the following 

1) Restart plan - as per your request
.

	
 

2) Employee briefing - pre deal execution communication - knowing as much as we know now and speculating to a certain extent on how some of the benefits/terms etc will be treated. This needs work on the business overview and business outlook but I see this as a "pre offer" sales pitch to employees to be followed up with another one the purchaser is known and then with the actual offer itself

 
Both are drafts

Neil

I'm assuming the Nymex desk will get 12 Million of Var. 

If you allocate out about 50 Million and Gas gets 30 Million of that,  12 seems reasonable.  

What do you think.

Louise,

As you know, we were told during today's Integration Committee call that Marketing's and Legal's text changes for the
website would be accepted any time today. Following the call, however, I was told that the noon deadline was firm, but
we could make minor text changes on Thursday. Based on that information, we forwarded partial comments to Kal Shah by
noon. In a late afternoon email, I found out that we will not be able to complete our changes until perhaps five days
after the site goes live.

We appreciate the pressure and long hours people in Houston are putting into getting the site up and running. We applaud
their efforts and do not wish to add to their burden. I tell you this only to make you aware of our situation, should
any problems arise because of the unedited text. Hopefully, if anything does arise, problems can be easily and quickly
corrected.

Please call me at 212-713-8508 if you have any questions or if I can help you in any way.

Thank you,

Claudia Robinson
Director, Employee Communications, UBS Americas Inc.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.
 
Lavo

Louise, Attached please find our ERCOT business plan for your review.  Doug and I have jointly put together a trading/marketing detailed plan to get ERCOT restarted as quickly as possible.  We have separated the plan in three tiers to prioritize tasks and customers in order to expedite earnings for early 2002.  

One thing you should note is that in ERCOT we will not need a FERC power marketing license to start trading physical power due to Texas not being regulated by FERC.  Therefore if there is a drag on obtaining the FERC license, ERCOT should be in the lead for regions getting restarted.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks, - Mike

As per my email from yesterday;
 
Attached are Pipeline companies, Transmission Company (Ercot) and Canadian companies not on the prior "Louise Approved" list which credit has been working on.
 
We have been having difficulty tracking down the full legal name for some of the storage and transmission companies, and for AEC storage, there are two names - I assume only one may be required. For any cases where the full legal name cannot be found today, we have included the group name. We will resolve the remaining full legal names on Monday morning, when other staff are available.
 
Dave

Louise,

Here is a sneak preview for you of a list which Pat O'donnell asked me to pull together for him, for his briefing to Mike Hutchins this evening.

It is not yet complete, but I wanted to give you a heads-up before I send to Pat.

Dave

Hi Louise

Hope all is well and that your trip to and from London went smoothly!

A few questions:
1.	Does Enron have a system which collects data by customer?  We
have something called CMIS which we use for these purposes and which I
believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don't
have something already.  We usually need customer info for reg
reporting purposes.

2.	Bob Dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of
sorts whereat the heads of Gas and Power Trading present to key UBSW
people what their businesses are all about, example trade flows,
competitive pressures, key reg reporting requirements, etc.  He would
also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what
they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets.  The
thought is to try and do this on Thursday because so many UBSW people
will be on the ground in Houston for the simulation exercise.  I don't
know that I am wedded to that day and I am a bit unsure about whether
this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration
but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and I
am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this
once they start trading.  What do you think?

The audience would include key logistics personnel from UBSW and Enron
and anyone else you thought appropriate.  Spoke with Mike about it and
he is fine.

3.	Having UBSW paraphenalia sent down - toys, shirts, etc., should
be arriving by no later than Tuesday.  If you haven't received anything
by late on Monday could you let me know so I can track down.  UBSW and
UBSW Energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both
trading floors - they should arrive by Wed.

4.	Was thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor
on Friday to commemorate the closing.  What do you think?

5.	I am planning to be down in Houston for most of next week.  I
thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to
address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on Friday.  I
will be leaving on a late Monday flight and returning on a late
afternoon Friday flight.  I hope you think this will be useful.  Please
let me know otherwise.

Sorry for the long message.  Please feel free to call me at home or on
my cell if you have any questions, issues, would like to discuss H 914
764 4597  C 917 523 6132.

Louise, attached is a spreadsheet with details regarding setting up pipeline transportation contracts for NETCO. In addition to the contract setup, Gas Logistics is working with the IT group on the splitting of the Estate and NETCO trading environments. 

Note: The prioritization of what pipes to tackle first was dictated by the Gas Desk Heads.
