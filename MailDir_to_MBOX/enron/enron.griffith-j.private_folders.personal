Nope, not this time around.  No movie star.
Other then the work stuff, things are going well for me too.
I'm glad to hear that all is well for you (ferrarri and all...).  Do you
think they'll give me a car too if I
work for them?
In regards to space, I know what you mean.  I needed so much that I am no
longer married.  It was
not an easy decission or thing to do, but definetely the right one.  I've
been living in South Beach
for the past 8 months and lived with my mom for a little while before that.
Butch is doing well.  He is not reporting to Pedro anymore.  He is under a
new manager under
Ana doing web stuff.  He's been working extremely long hours and under a
lot of preassure.
They had to release new hardware.  I don't think things went very well.
I'll let him know you say hi.

Anyway...I'll call you next week and for sure you will be the 2nd, or maybe
third to know if I make it
out to Houston.

Don't work too hard.

Did they think that you were a movie star at the Sushi Bar?  How are things
going?  It is good to here from you.

I haven't travelled at all, I am now trading natural gas options here at
Enron.  I have been really busy.  I get into work around 6:15 and work
until about 6 on the evening.  I don't even leave my desk for lunch.  They
bring it to me.  I only have a chance to leave my desk for the special
things (haha).

I hope that you are well.  I still miss Florida and all my Floridian
buddies, but things are going well here.  My job is going really well
(promotion, big bonus, company ferrarri....).  Just kidding about the car.
But really everything is going well.  I just miss getting away.  Marriage
is good, but I think that everyone needs their space sometimes (you know
what I mean).

Well I better go.  Call me sometime. My work number is (713) 853-6247.  If
you every make it to Houston be sure to let me know.  Talk to you soon.

John

PS  How is Butch doing?  Tell him hi

You always said that we would end up working together at some stage...

Actually I've just logged into the mail system here in London were I'm 
currently working on a project with Enron Metals Trading, still employed by 
Cap Gemini Ernst & Young though. What's Houston like? Hot as usual I guess 
and Enron keeps you busy, or? I've been doing a fair bit of travelling around 
Europe lately so London actually feels just like a short distance and a nice 
place to be since everybody speaks english and working with Enron is a 
challangening task. This is going to be an interesting project.

Back home life goes on and I got married last october. We really enjoy our 
house and in that sence it's a pity to be away so much, but you can't have it 
all, can you :-)

Got to go! Cheers!

/ Anders

Hey John & Angie, Have you heard the news from K-Girl?  Probably, but I'm
going to tell you anyway.  We're going to have a wedding July 28th.  K-Girl &
B-Boy will get married in Midland at Centennial Plaza(the most beautiful
water garden) in the AM.  We're pretty excited about the whole thing.
Keran's words to you are, you would make it very special if you
Angie(especially you Angie) & John(of course you John) could be there. It's
going to be a beautiful affair, no problems(everyoune must leave problems at
home or not come) that's the rules.  Southwest is running a special and I
would fly you two out for the day or for however long you wanted to stay.
Check your calendar and if you can it will be WONDERFUL but remember if you
can't we certainly understand and will just have to have another one in
Houston just for you two.
Love you so much!!!!
Mel

John and Angie this was the best Christmas yet.  Thank you for the Very
Stylish Suitcase.  I think I will set the standard for travel these days.  It
took me 12 hrs to get home from Houston.  Icy roads, yuck,  my normally 2hr
30 min trip from San Angelo took 6 hrs.  Once again Thanks for making mine &
Kerans Christmas so Wonderful.

Yes, this is a new show, not to be confused with Quidam which they did the
last time they were in Houston.  Now here's how I think we should handle
this.  Instead of your preferred date, respond to me by tomorrow with the
dates you are NOT available and I'll pick a date that avoids as many
scheduling conflicts as possible.  The deal that my company is offering
requires the purchase of fifteen tickets for a given performance.  If they
don't get 15, then we'll be offered an alternative date.  Tickets are $60
each.  Let me know if you are interested in going and how many tickets you
want by tomorrow and I'll put it all together as a single order.  You can
send me a check at the address below.

Can you say CIRCUS!

Well, yep, I am still alive, I still exist here in LA. This hasn't been
easy, it's not easy, but it hasn't killed me, just given me a recurring
chest cold. It seems that it's only really hard to breathe on the days when
I have something pretty big and pressing to do, like the day before actually
getting the truck, or today when I had to go to Aquent to get tested on my
computer skills, and then wanted to go apply for jobs at 12 different
photo-related businesses (which I didn't do). But on the days that I allow
myself to have fun, it is great.

Last week on Monday I went to Point Dume beach w/ Mark Allen and his friend
Elyse, and we had a great time. Of course the water and the day were way too
cold to go swimming, but we hiked up a cliff overhanging the water, where
surfers were trying to catch the 9-15 foot waves. I got pictures of them,
and photo'd Mark and Elyse walking through the crazy daisies that grow
bushlike out of the top of 2.5' sticks in the sand. Then on Sat., I went
hiking by myself in Griffith Park, which is literally up the street from our
house. Griffith Park is a big park in the Hollywood Hills, maybe (I'm not
sure) where the Hollywood sign is. Sort of a California version of Central
Park, with mountains and a whole lot more wild. (From our apartment, we can
see the "lly" and "d" of the Hollywood sign, mostly obscured by palm trees.)
So I was walking along this dirt fire road, amazed at the solitude and
immensity of the nature, my head being buzzed by an annoyed bee or
something, when I turned a corner and saw a huge chunk of LA in front of me.
I'm still too new here to be able to know exactly what I was looking at, but
way in the distance I could see jets taking off from LAX, I think. Closer
was Hollywood, where I live. There were some tall buildings that I think
were the Melrose area, and way in the distance, I could see these buildings
that were backlit from the light reflecting off the ocean. The Ocean. The
Pacific. I could see the PACIFIC from the MOUNTAINS by my house. It is
amazing. Okay, maybe they're technically hills, since I could walk up them
following the trails, but they are definitely mountains to me. Besides, you
can practically walk up Everest, w/ oxygen.
We've gone to art openings, had fun there, gone to parties, had fun there,
too. Can't find really good, really cheap beer here like Pearl, yet, but
I'll keep trying. The Food for Less has a twenty-pack of Budweiser for
$9.98, just 50? a beer. Went to two music shows this last week, at two
different places, and was able to bring my camera in, no problem.
I still haven't processed any film here yet, still way too broke to do it.
I've got about 18 or 19 rolls shot so far, some of it from before I left
Houston. I'll probably process the film even though I "can't afford it", cuz
I'm thinking I might be able to use some of the photos in my portfolio,
which I can use to make me some big money. Gotta spend money to make it,
gotta believe it's worth it, cuz it is. It's easy to believe in my head,
but's harder to get off the couch. I'm still trying to get the guts to go
through all my photos and put together my portfolio. I was out today, had
just filled out a simple application at a camera store (my first), when I
realized I was carrying around my graphics portfolio, and none of my photos.
So I bought some ice cream and came home.
I miss you guys. Tell me how you are. Write to me, email me, call me.
Instant message me, even. Jody is not enough for me, I need other friends.
Remember that I'm two hours behind you, and I stay up really late, so you
can call me at 4am there and I'm still not even home from the bar yet. I
expect every single one of you to move out here one day. Don't forget about
me when I make it big.

Tony,

Whats up?  Hey I think that Mexico is playing US tomorrow in Ohio for the
World Cup qualifying.  Is Mexico any good?  Should we wager on the match?
Hope things are going well with you.  Talk to you soon.

My work number is (713) 853-6247 if you want to call me anytime.  I got a
promotion.  I am now trading Natural Gas Options.  We trade them over the

Tell your family hi and have a great day.

What up, my peoples?!?

After Thursday, Jan. 04, I will no longer be able to receive email at
this address. The Chronicle has opted to cancel my contract, so I will
not be working fulltime for them anymore. I will continue to work here
parttime in graphics, at night, however. Please forward all new email to
me at herrmannal@hotmail.com  starting immediately. Please note this is
a new address, not to be confused with the bad spamful
al_herrmann@hotmail.com (bad! don't send mail there!)  Thank you for
your attention to this matter.

On a much happier note, on Monday Jan. 1st I got a phone call from an
adoption registry I had signed up with on a lark about a month ago. They
found my biological mother, who had been looking for me, and gave me her
phone no., name, etc. We've left phone messages for each other, and I
expect to talk w/ her maybe tonight. Pretty freaky, huh? I am in shock.

Hello, Sweetness! Sorry I didn't get back to you right away. You guys should
come here! It is awesome! Jody, Eric Neibhur, and I drove up into the
mountains on Sunday and played in the snow. It was awesome. We got there in
less than an hour after stopping twice to look at the view. I tried to make
a snow angel, but it was more of an ice angel, really. Neither Jody nor Eric
had gloves, so they weren't too keen on making snowballs and throwing them
at me. Still, we had a great time.

Sat. we went to see this performance group Fischerspooner in sort of the
equivalent of the Rice Hotel while it was under construction. They wore
crazy costumes and danced around and sang over djed music. It was pretty
cool, especially since we snuck in the back door, even though it was free,
since we didn't have reservations. (I made an animation of it. I'm trying to
figure out how to put it online for y'all!) Then we went to Chinatown for
art openings, and that was really cool. Then we went to a renovated bowling
alley to see a secret show by Kim Deal, but she didn't play cuz supposedly
Kelly Deal got married that day. But there was an alright band w/ the most
Amazingly cute girl singer, so it all good.

So you guys have to come here! Come here! C'mere!

See yu on Fri at Jessica's opening at Lawndale, then on Sat at the wedding.
Yeah!!!!!

Al Herrmann

John - thanks for the kind words about Colorforms.? It was a lot of fun 
putting together and the feedback so far has been very complimentary - 
they've already run out of the color brochures so people must be interested 
in learning more.? Thanks for coming to the opening and supporting the show.? 
It means a lot to have friends believe in my projects.? 

I haven't seen the Core show yet but am looking forward to it.? What did you 
think?? I heard that Jessica's piece is real nice.

I look forward to seeing you two soon - maybe we could talk about DJ 
equipment then.? BTW, do you still have my Anokha CD.? I was looking for it 
the other day and couldn't find it.? Not a big deal if you don't.? I'll just 
pick up another copy.

Take care,

Baloy, Grils Baloy

Good to hear things are moving. I heard about the Dynegy deal. Things change
quickly sometimes, eh?

Married life's getting better and better. Bonita, my wife, is working since
half a year, and we've moved into a house in Arlington, a short subway-ride
from the office. At one point, we were actually considering moving to
Houston. We even spent a weekend looking for a house. But we changed our
mind, it just wasn't worth the effort, mostly because we're planning to move
back to Stockholm next summer. Starting to get homesick I guess...

You're right in that I'm working with Jeff Young. He's not directly my boss,
but we're in the same group. I report to Jeff Hunter, he's now the practice
leader for the Energy Risk Management group. The corporate structure that
you knew about is very different from today. When we last met, I worked for
Cap Gemini Hagler Bailly, and the Europeans were all from Cap Gemini. Since
then, CGHB has been dissolved (when Cap Gemini bought Ernst & Young
Consulting), and I went on to Hagler Bailly, that eventually got acquired by
PA Consulting Group. I still have some contact with Anders Ryrfeldt (his
wife is expecting a baby in December) at the energy team at Cap in
Stockholm, most of the other guys have moved on.

PA has been doing quite well so far through this downturn. We're in the
black, and have not layed anyone off. The last half year has been pretty
hectic, with work at Shell and El Paso as well as speaker slots at few
conferences. Have also got a couple of articles published, in the September
issue of the Risk Desk and the December issue of Energy & Power Risk
Management (EPRM).

I'll give you a call next time I go to Houston.

/mattias

Everything is going okay.  Dynegy has bought us out.  I think that if I was
still in structuring then I might be worried, but I am trading natural gas
options and the desk I work for has been very profitable.  I think that the
natural gas and power trading floors are the main reason they bought us.  I
would think they would like to keep things as they are on these desks, but
you never know.  It will take 6-9 months before anything happens.

How are you doing?  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I would love to
get together sometime.  My phone number is (713) 853-6247.  Call me
sometime.

I guess you are working for Jeff Young now?  He used to be my boss.  How is
the Europe group?  Are they still the same?  I am not for sure how your
company is set up now.

How is married life?  Is you wife in the US now?  Are you still in DC?

Talk to you soon.

John

Hey big brother, how are things going?  Happy New Year and a belated Merry
Christmas to everyone.  I hope that everything is going okay.  I am sorry
that I did not make it to your house for Christmas.  I am very bad about
procrastination and I wait to the last minute on everything.  I do miss you
guys and we will come to stay with you soon.  I hope that you can forgive
me.  I am really sorry.  I love you very much.  We just stayed here and had
a very quite Christmas and New Years.  I did see Mel and Keran.  They
seemed to be okay.  Angie and I drove to Keran's house on Christmas nite.
Everything just happened to quick.  We were not prepared time wise and
financial wise to leave town for Christmas.  How was it?  I guess you had
really bad weather.  Lots of ice and snow?  How is business?  I have been
really busy here.  I didn't take any time off during the holidays.  Being
the new person in the group, I couldn't.  It was really busy.

I love you guys very much and I better get back to work.  I will try to
call you tomorrow afternoon.  Tell everyone hi.

Love you

J Boy.

Hey J-Boy, Just wanted you to know I made it home OK.  Keran was doing wonderful and I knew she & Brennen were ready for time to themselves.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed our visits.  Tell Angie I missed seeing her and next time I want to visit with her too.  Thank you for your concern for Keran, You were there for me when I needed you.

Happy Thanksgiving !!!!! Hope your's was as good as mine.  I didn't come to Houston, I'm saving my time for Christmas, so I spent time with Robyn, Jay & boys.  We ate at Furr's and went to the movies (the boys & Robyn-Harry Potter, Jay & I-Training Day) we had a good time and to top it off I got to see Mike, Rhonda & kids.  Everyone seems to be adjusting to the move. They said if I see you to tell you Hi. 
I'll be coming to Houston on Sat before Christmas, Please let me see you guys before I leave on Wednesday. 
Love You 
Mel

Hey you two,
?
Yes, this email is business - Lawndale business.? I'm not really accustomed 
to talking business with my friends so let me say right at the beginning that 
should you not be interested in the following, no harm, no foul.? The last 
thing I want to do is create any discomfort but I really think that this 
might be something that you'd be interested in.? 
?
First, I'm organizing a show at Lawndale that will open on March 9th in the 
Main Gallery called Colorforms.? It's going to include 3 painters - 2 from 
Dallas and 1 from New York - and one sculptor - maybe you know her: Jessica 
Halonen?? She's a core fellow.? I'm really excited about the show.? I did 
studio visits with three of the artists this past weekend and they're all 
working on great stuff.? I'm so jazzed about it, that I've been inspired to 
write an essay and I haven't written about art in 6 years!Anyway, I'm trying 
to do something a little more substantial for the gallery notes - more than 
just a folded piece of card stock - and I told Lawndale that I would try and 
fund-raise for it.? I'm mentioning this to you only because you have 
expressed interest in the past in helping out if I am putting any projects 
together.? I'm trying to raise about $250 to cover printing costs.? I'd also 
like to have a DJ at the ! opening - maybe Patrick Phipps - but I need to 
fund-raise for his fee too.? I know you're thinking "what about DJ Grils 
Baloy" and I'd like to do it but I'm thinking that I need to circulate 
amongst the guests at a show that I organized.? 
?
Second, I'm co-chairing Lawndale's Mid-Century Market this year and so I'm 
also fund-raising for it.? There is a formal letter/packet that has been put 
together but I thought I would ask you a little less formally if you're 
interested in supporting the event.? Last year the Market did quite well 
based on booth rentals and admission.? This year we're focusing on increasing 
the number of donors to the event which has traditionally been small.? There 
are several levels of support with varying benefits at each level.? All 
proceeds from the event go directly to Lawndale's operating budget.
?
As you can tell, I've been increasing my involvement with Lawndale, trying to 
help them get through this period of growing pains.? I regret the fact 
that?these events - Colorforms and the Market? - are happening so close 
together purely from an "asking" point-of-view, but they both seem to have 
"John and Angie" written all over them.? However, if this just isn't a good 
time for you to be doing this sort of thing then I completely understand.? 
Nonetheless, I hope that they might pique your interest.? I'll look forward 
to hearing from you.
?

Hi John:

It was nice to hear from you.  I am glad that you and Angie are well.  Chris
just got back from Dallas visiting Jeff and Stacy and saw there new house.
He says that it is going to be fantastic and that they are really well.

Things are busy here too.  I am getting ready for another exhibition to open
at the end of August.  It is on early 20th century design.  I hope you will
get a chance to see it.  Chris is very excited about starting his job on
Monday.  I am really happy for him.

We stopped by Don's shop on SUnday and heard that you had been teh week
before.  We will need to ccordinate our visits so that we can all get
together.

I hope we will see you both soon!

Hey, I made this silly animation after seeing performance art/music/dance
troupe Fischerspooner last Sat, but I didn't have my camera. Mr. Hughes was
kind enough to host it on his site in a secret place. So the only way you
can see it is to click this link:

http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/jodyhughes/Als.folder/FischerspoonerbyAlHerrmann
.html

It takes a few minutes to download, but I think it's worth it.

xoxoxox,

BMC was able to get us the 23 tickets for the 19th.  These will be Category
2 seating which I've been guaranteed is great.  It seems that Category 1
seating has been scooped up by season ticket holders and other groups that
also had early purchase opportunities - BMC alone is ordering over 500
tickets for its employees with our 23 tickets included in that number.
Anyway, these tickets are $50 instead of $60 so those of you who have
already put your checks in the mail will get a refund from me at some point.
In the meantime, we can all mark up our calendars for the 19th of January.

Cheers,
cb

Sorry boy, the US won.  I guess the Mexicans couldn't handle the cold of
Ohio.  Maybe they need to get toughened up a little.  Talk to you soon.

Hey John!
 
How's it going?
 
Thought I'd send you guys images from the show at  Mark Moore in Santa Monica. They and the installation turned out really good,  and I hope they ask me to show again.
 
Try to get these to Angie as well.
 
Let me know how you guys are doing. And hope to see  you around.
 
Later, Todd
 
PS: can you give me Angie's email...I don't want to  get it wrong again.

Mr. Griffith-- 
Alvaro Saar Rios passed your information on to me--he mentioned the  
possibility of donating a projector.  If so, please contact Tony Diaz at  
aztecmuse@aol.com or (713) 867-8943 and let him know of this possibility. 
Also, if you are interested in becoming more involved, esp. as a volunteer,  
please go to the brand-new website and register.   
Thank you, isabel martinez

Helloo, my beautiful Houston kittens!!

Here's a link to some of the photos from my third-to-last night in Texas:
http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=155943&a=11400679

Thanks so much to those of you who made it out to our going-away party last
night. I'm sorry that not everybody could be there, but I understand and
hope you're feeling better. And thanks to everybody for your friendship and
support over the years. Anyway, I had a great time at the party, even when I
fell on my head while trying to do a keg stand. I wish I'd had more time to
spend with each of you. I feel honored to be able to call you my friends,
and I hope the distance between us won't change that. Please keep in touch
with me, let me know how you're doing, and come visit me in California.
We'll go to the beach, and hang out with movie stars together.

xoxoxox,
Al Herrmann

dear John,
thanks for the interest.
The Brionvega rr 126 is for sale and it is working, even if the record
played it is not perfect(but working too).
The price is $ 1.500.000 and the shipping price could be around $250.000.
Thanks and regards.
Sabrina e Diego

Gearing up for first move-in to the new building. My mom also had a stroke in the spring and that's taking huge amounts of time. I'm hanging in there. Certainly can't complain in these times.

Hope you're doing well.

You always said that we would end up working together at some stage...

Actually I've just logged into the mail system here in London were I'm currently working on a project with Enron Metals Trading, still employed by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young though. What's Houston like? Hot as usual I guess and Enron keeps you busy, or? I've been doing a fair bit of travelling around Europe lately so London actually feels just like a short distance and a nice place to be since everybody speaks english and working with Enron is a challangening task. This is going to be an interesting project.

Back home life goes on and I got married last october. We really enjoy our house and in that sence it's a pity to be away so much, but you can't have it all, can you :-)

Got to go! Cheers!

/ Anders

I just wanted everyone to know that I begin my new radio shift tomorrow
morning.  For those who are able to tune in on the radio, it's 91.7.  For
those who plan to listen over the Internet, it's www.ktru.org.  I'll be on
every other Tuesday morning from 7-9 AM until December.  Feel free to call
up and make requests or just to say "hi".  Also, if you're interested in
checking out set lists from my previous shows, go to the Web site and search

Rock on,

I am compelled to write a note on this last tumultuous week. It is hard to
believe it is less than a week. It has been a horrific nightmare here in New
York. You can imagine that it is hard to think, work, and smile at a time
like this. But my feeling is that everything we do as human beings if for
each other, for  our public memory and psyche. We create to nurture
enjoyment, pleasure, and experience. I think that we must consider our
evanescent lives and contribute love and peace in everything we touch, do,
and breathe.

I hope for world peace and world love. I send my regards and prayers to
everyone, my friends, my colleagues and everyone that was touched by this
tragedy. I have lost some friends in this catastrophe and it hurts, but more
importantly I am concerned about us as a collective race, as a civility. We
need to start loving each other and forge ahead and create beauty for
everyone.

Be the change you want to see in the world (Ghandi)


Love and kisses, Karim

Hey there everybody. I went to the doctor today and they said the 
pathology of my neck stuff was clear, so as far as they know I'm free 
of cancer. So no radiation, but I do get to keep the pirate scar and 
my fetching new lisp, both of which are already attracting 
appreciative notice from the ladies.
I'm relieved of course, and also totally bewildered. I  feel like a 
giant tidal wave swept over me this month and is now heading back out 
to sea. I'll contact you all individually once I get some of the 
saltwater, starfish, and barnacles out of my hair and underpants. 
Thanks for all your positive thoughts and wishes.
Love
Mark

The lovely and talented Beth Secor, the funny funny Beth Secor, the Beth
Secor we all know and love so much, is moving to Baltimore, MD during
the first week of the New Year. I just don't know how the good part of
Texas will survive without her. Just this year Beth won some prize for
her badass painting at the Lawndale Big Show, and she should've won some
other prize for being so damn funny over the years. So here's the thing:

On Thursday, Dec 21, 7:30 - 9pm at DiverseWorks, Beth is doing her Final
Reading. Tickets are $5 and I think all proceeds go to helping Beth
move. Also, she'll  unload a bunch of her old work from the 80's and
early 90's for $10 -$50 that
night. So go check it out. Man, to get a Beth for $50- that's CRAZY! $10
is just insane.

Seriously, Beth is great. Go see her read her hilarious stuff. Go get a
painting. I SO MUCH wish I could go, but I'll be at work. Oh, here's a
link to a bit of her writing:
http://www.creativealliance.org/peekreview/ Go there and click on
Houston Diary.

Ok. Peace. Love. Al Gore.
xox,
Al

John:

I'm used to calling you Johnny so please let me know your preference.

Anyway, I just wanted to follow up on our conversation about selling my 'bones.'    I'm going to scan a picture of her as soon as I can and forward that to you as well.    

I forgot to mention that the guys I bought it from were Oddfellows, which is a fraternal organization kind of like the Masons except for lower class types (their words).  If your'e not familiar with the Oddfellows, they made the news recently because they use skeleton's in their initiation rituals.  Very odd indeed.  They guys told me the bones are female....I don't know how to tell.

Talk soon, Peter
