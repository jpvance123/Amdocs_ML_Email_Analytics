Roman,

I talked to Richard and he would be very interested in talking with Dale Osburn.  Can you send him the number?

Hope all is well....

Forward Price Views for Competitive Energy Markets  [IMAGE] =09
  [IMAGE]   Dear Jubran,   Recognizing the pronounced volatility and uncert=
ainty  in the energy industry, ZE PowerGroup has developed processes and  t=
ools to facilitate dynamic trading and risk management. One of  the foremos=
t tools required for competitive operation is the availability  of represen=
tative forward natural gas and power views for the various  market hubs.   =
Given that generation resource development, price behavior and  industry re=
sponsiveness has been significantly outside of historic  norms established =
during the extended period of regulation, and  given recent world events ha=
ve resulted in greater uncertainty in  the economy it is critical that an o=
rganization be able to probabilistically  predict future prices, with some =
degree of accuracy.  The market is always asking itself questions like:   S=
hould I commit to a deal now or wait?  For how much and for how long should=
 I commit? What is the impact of this transaction on my portfolio? How do m=
arket events impact near, mid and long term pricing? How long will the pric=
e remain at the current level?  A forward view is a prerequisite to manage =
and optimize on an energy  portfolio in competitive markets. ZE PowerGroup =
provides short,  mid and long-term Forward Price Views. The Forward Price V=
iews are  developed using sophisticated, top-down market simulation models =
 that are readily customizable and adaptable in size and scope to  any regi=
on in North America. The Forward Price Models have been  designed using the=
 key drivers and fundamental parameters of the  natural gas and electrical =
power industries in combination with  econometric techniques and expert jud=
gment. The value of the model  is in its ability to extract and quantify th=
e expert judgment.  The difference between the ZE PowerGroup Forward Price =
Model and  other models is that of a top-down market simulation versus bott=
om-up  generation modeling. The bottom-up generation model does not always =
 account for market behavior and assumes that generation is predominantly  =
economically. These modes make little or no allowance for market  power, in=
efficiencies, gaming or other operational or unique market  factors.  ZE Po=
werGroup developed their first price views in 1996. The Forward  Price Mode=
l has performed well as a guiding tool; the views created  from the models =
have consistently predicted the direction of price  movement in the markets=
. It was one of the few models that predicted  rapid and consistent price i=
ncreases after deregulation when the  industry consensus was that prices wo=
uld retreat. Clients who have  incorporated the price views into their stra=
tegic planning have  reaped significant benefits and mitigated price risks;=
 fairing better  than their counterparts.  The Forward Price Model can be c=
oupled with the Market Monitoring  subscription, which adds value through t=
argeted intelligence required  to optimize positioning in uncertain and vol=
atile markets.  ZE PowerGroup strives to provide timely and required intell=
igence  at reasonable cost.  For more information on ZE PowerGroup's Forwar=

Richard:
 
I understand from Elliot that we want to keep the spreadsheet of EES positions separate from our Fundies site. 
I started a file at O:\Portland\WestDesk\RenewablePowerDesk\Shared\Internal intelligence\EES Position based on the info. you provided to Jesse in an e-mail dated 10/8.
The spreadsheet is attached.
 
*Will this spreadsheet meet our needs?
*Is the location suitable?  
    -How limited should access to this be?  
*What is the most efficient mechanism by which to update this information - i.e., will you update it directly, or coordinate with me?
 
Thanks, 
 
Jenny

Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made "but for" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.


If you need further information, please let me know.

While it is highly desirable to standardize products across regions, it is not often possible to maintain the same value proposition in all regions.  For example, NJ does not have a post transition default service as is the case for Maryland.  New York may be able to offer ICAP and Ancillaries in the fixed basis.   At this point, it appears that New Jersey's fixed basis will only include deal costs (consumption, credit, billing, scheduling fees and incentive repayment).  Therefore, NJ fixed basis will differ from that of New York's. 

We should await the final outcome of the Mark to Market issue before settling on the language for the NJ fixed basis. 

On the subject of Excess Usage during the index period, any excess usage on the part of the customer will mean more revenue for EES in the form of fixed basis times actual usage.  We should not impose an upper limit on an index product where actual volumes are passed through to the customer.   I agree, however, that there should be deficiency language to protect the fixed basis that is marked. 

Thanks

Subject:	Re: NJ Index plus   

Please see attached.  I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.  I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering, which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include.  

I am not convinced that we can't express the basis as the "Fixed Basis" rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition, so I have left it the way it was.  I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.  It is really an optic (customers always have the right to request a restructured price) and I'm not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong market-based reason to do so.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Subject: NYISO - Delay of Virtual Trading



market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion
List:

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO has determined that implementation of Virtual Trading will be
delayed until Wednesday, November 7, 2001.  Issues associated with new
computer hardware have necessitated extending the testing period to ensure
that all systems are ready before starting the program.

Virtual Trading will be in place for the Wednesday, November 7 Day-Ahead
Market (DAM).  The new schedule will permit bids for virtual load and
virtual supply to be submitted for Wednesday's market after the DAM posts
on Monday, November 5, until 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 6.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Account Representative
or the Customer Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

All - 
 

GSA issued an RFP for one of their Houston facilities.....might be a good opportunity for us.  Check it out <http://www.eps.gov/spg/GSA/PBS/PNE/GS-00P-02-BSD-0001/listing.html> 
 Chart depicting probability for RPS in states that EES is considering delivering physical power  (attachment below) 
 I finally had a chance to look over the fundamentals map.  Great way to organize the information.  I have a few questions/observations that I've listed below.   Many of the below comments might be premature as I don't know what stage you are in as far as filling in the information.  I also don't know if I have the most current link.  I used the following link <http://wnapdx-01a390/Renewables/DeregulationMap.htm>

 
1.  California:  Legislation - Is it accurate to say the legislation is "pending".  I thought it was highly unlikely that CA will go into another special session this year.  I believe the legislation will have to be reintroduced next session.  As far as risks/opportunities - Elliot could probably recap all of the wholesale opportunities associated with aggregating green for munis.
 
RPS
2. Nevada:  I'm assuming this just hasn't been updated yet?
 
3.  Arizona:  You might want to note that the renewable requirement is placed on utilities only until 2004.  Competitive supplier's obligation begins in '04.
 
4. New Mexico: Same as NV.
 
5. MN:  Make clear this requirement is on utilities.  I believe there is also a green pricing program requirement.  
 
6.  IA:  I believe this requirement is obsolete.  You might want to verify.  
 
7.  IL: Not sure this information is relevant as it is not an RPS, and doesn't apply to EES. 
 
8. CT:  The RPS applies to all competitive entities.
 
9.  MA:  Just passed final draft RPS.  While the definition you have is correct for renewables in MA, the eligibility is limited for compliance with the RPS to new renewables, coming on line after 12/31/97.  The definition is: Solar PV or Solar Thermal Electric; Wind; Ocean thermal, wave or tidal; fuel cells utilizing an eligible renewable fuel; Landfill gas; Low-emission advanced biomass power using the following fuels: agriculture and food waste, energy crops, biodiesel, organic refuse-derived fuel that is collected and managed separately from MSW, landfill or digester methane case.  The RPS applies to all competitive suppliers.
 
10.  Texas:  For some reason, TX is left off of the map as having an RPS.
 
11.  I thought you guys were concentrating on competitive states, so I was surprised to see IA, MN and HI on the list.  If you list these states, you'll need to go into a lot more detail as there are currently 220 utility green programs.  WI is probably the leading state for utilities with a mandate.  For the sake of simplicity, I'd limit it to competitive states.
 
 
Incentive funds:  I saw that your map included a space for incentives for renewables.   Below are the competitive states (albeit CA is no longer competitive) with renewable energy funds.  I don't know if you want to include all of this information.
1.  States with renewable incentives: CA, CT, IL, MA, MT, NM, NJ, NY PA, RI, 
 
 
Last:  I know you probably used the wording from Gov't affairs for the status of dereg.  You might want to update the information is the state is already open.  For example, IL says the state started restructuring in '99 and will continue to phase in customers until Dec 2000.  I believe that was written prior to Dec 2000.   You could just say that it is open.

 Hope this is helpful.  Jenny and Jesse, I know you've guys have put a lot of work into the fundies and it will pay off!

Why is this formulation of the EESI Energy Price  any different than saying "plus the Fixed Basis" and then defining the Fixed Basis as a $/kWh amount?  Isn't it exactly the same?  We've written it the way it was before so it is easy to plug in the fixed basis number.

Why have you changed the calculations of excess and deficiency usage charges during the index period?  Why have you used the reference to a Management Fee in the new language?  Why are there no charges for Excess Usage during the index period--are you really giving them the fised basis position for unlimited usage?

Subject:	NJ Index plus

Following today's discussions with the Transaction Accounting group to discuss fixed basis Mark to Market, Product Management has modified the definition of the EESI Energy Price.   

The conclusion of the discussion with Transaction Accounting was that the Index product does in fact create a commodity position that the commodity desk can "choose" to manage.  The "revenue" position that is created when the contract is signed with the customer will be settled based on the published PJM Zone LMP, nevertheless the commodity desk may choose to manage their "cost" otherwise.  The proposed fixed basis will be treated as ONE with the index in determining the EESI Energy Price.   This approach is very similar in nature to the definition of the "Plus" that is defined in the ENovative Lite Energy Service Agreement for Gas products.  

Therefore, the EESI Energy Price will now read:

""EESI Energy Price" means the sum of the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus $0.0[    ] per kWh."

Please see the attached transaction confirmation and comment on the new definition of the fixed basis.  All references to the fixed basis ("Management Fee")  as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language.  


 

Please provide your comments accordingly.

Thanks

Richard,

We are still selling our ICAP into the short-term market.  Narsimha was
going to send me a description of how the sale to you would work so we could
get comfortable with the details of a longer term sale.  That would be the
first step in any discussion we might have.

Here's an update to yesterday's meeting on this subject.

Product Development (Jim Wood, JD Burrows, JeVaughn Sterling, Gillian Johnson and myself) had a brief discussion with Jim Brown (Transaction Accounting) to review the applicability of MTM accounting for the Maryland index product.

With relatively minor contract changes (to ensure the product is an "Index Plus" structure) the conclusion of the discussion was that the product should qualify for MTM.  Market costs will not necessarily match revenues (for the reasons we discussed yesterday) which should make the product eligible for MTM.   The desk would have an index position.  The desk can then choose to manage the position or not.

Nina and I certainly want to make sure you agree with this reasoning.  Here's a 1st draft of a TC with marked revisions.  The "Management Fee" is eliminated and replaced with EESI Energy Index Price plus $__/kWh in this draft. 

Please let me know if you think this is still workable from your perspective.  A follow-up meeting will be scheduled if needed.

Thanks,
Bob

Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You

I'm not sure I want to give this guy this info, but if I were, what would you recommend I tell him? I think he's putting together some sort of on-line electricity buyers guide for different deregulated markets.

Peggy, this is a summary version of the original information from Richard Ring. Richard's input about the below was that
it might not be suitable for direct distribution to customers but that it was acceptable for internal reference or talking points.
I don't think it can be condensed any more without losing important information.

SUMMARY

Upon becoming a NEPOOL member, EESI chose to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy requirement by issuance of Performance 
Bond(s) via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which issued a Performance Bond in the amount of $8,000,000. 

On or about October 12, 2001, EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, indicating that EESI's current 
Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  

In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, EESI was informed that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be
 resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001). 

By October 16, EESI had requested a bond increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, but encountered delays in 
working with the bond company.

EESI Credit Department personnel sent ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001, via FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for
 revisions to the Performance Bond, and indicated EESI was working diligently to resolve the matter.

EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to delays with the bond company 
as mentioned above. 

On October 19, 2001 another letter was sent to EESI by NEPOOL indicating that because EESI had not maintained the required level of financial 
assurance for 10 days or more, and this had occurred in combination with two other technical defaults, that this information was being forwarded 
to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action.  

Following resolution of delays with the bond company, a bond increase was issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed 
by EESI on October 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October 23, 2001.  

However, according to Protocol for the Initiation of Membership Termination Proceedings the issue should be resolved with the receipt on 
October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE.

Either today or Monday, I expect the NYISO to announce that it will be offering its 3-day Market Orientation Course in Houston December 11-13 at the Hyatt Regency. Enrollment will be limited to 150 people on an as-registered basis, so early registration is encouraged. The on-line registration process will be included in their announcement, which will be broadcast to the ISO's TIE list as well as put on their web site www.NYISO.com. Because Enron has previously sent people through this training course, the costs for Enron employees attending this training session will be $800.00 per person, rather than the normal $1,200.00 charge. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

ERCOT Communications has indicated that many folks are interested in receiving a copy of the October 1 Report and how to get it.  The "REPORT ON EXISTING AND POTENTIAL ELECTRIC SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS AND NEEDS WITHIN THE ERCOT REGION" is available for download at the following Internet address:ftp://ftp.ercot.com/TRANSCONS/transcons.htm  
The ftp (direct download) address is: ftp://ftp.ercot.com/TRANSCONS/ERCOTReportConstraintsNeeds10012001.zip  
It is a zip compressed file containing two MSWord documents and is a little over 1 meg in size.  Depending on your connection, please allow extra time to download it.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.

Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you.

FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you. After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings. It is clearly a cheap shot.

 

On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times.

 

Thanks,

Peggy

I now better understand the NJ product and what is included in the basis.  Thanks for clarifying and I agree with your analysis of how excess should work given this product description.  I understand that there are some MTM issues with a "cost only" fixed adder that does not represent a position against market.  I will hold off on further drafting until I hear back from you.  MDS

Subject:	Re: NJ Index plus   

While it is highly desirable to standardize products across regions, it is not often possible to maintain the same value proposition in all regions.  For example, NJ does not have a post transition default service as is the case for Maryland.  New York may be able to offer ICAP and Ancillaries in the fixed basis.   At this point, it appears that New Jersey's fixed basis will only include deal costs (consumption, credit, billing, scheduling fees and incentive repayment).  Therefore, NJ fixed basis will differ from that of New York's. 

We should await the final outcome of the Mark to Market issue before settling on the language for the NJ fixed basis. 

On the subject of Excess Usage during the index period, any excess usage on the part of the customer will mean more revenue for EES in the form of fixed basis times actual usage.  We should not impose an upper limit on an index product where actual volumes are passed through to the customer.   I agree, however, that there should be deficiency language to protect the fixed basis that is marked. 

Thanks

Subject:	Re: NJ Index plus   

Please see attached.  I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.  I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering, which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include.  

I am not convinced that we can't express the basis as the "Fixed Basis" rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition, so I have left it the way it was.  I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.  It is really an optic (customers always have the right to request a restructured price) and I'm not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong market-based reason to do so.

The Agreements between Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Green Power Partners I LLC, are for a term endinging December 31, 2002.  The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending April 30, 2002.  The Agreement between Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia) and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending December 31, 2002.

Additionally,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. has entered into various agreement(s) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to sell additional "green tickets" from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California:

EESI sells to EPMI, 1MW ATC, through December 31, 2001 (EPMI sells to EEMC)
EPMI sells to EEMC, 1MW ATC, through June 30, 2003
EESI sells to EPMI, 21 MW's, Sundays Off Peak, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)
EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

In this case there is a product element because at least the 2 retail contracts I named require us to serve green. If we assume them, we have to have green to serve.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the "Green Tickets Sales Agreement" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO has determined that implementation of Virtual Trading will be
delayed until Wednesday, November 7, 2001.  Issues associated with new
computer hardware have necessitated extending the testing period to ensure
that all systems are ready before starting the program.

Virtual Trading will be in place for the Wednesday, November 7 Day-Ahead
Market (DAM).  The new schedule will permit bids for virtual load and
virtual supply to be submitted for Wednesday's market after the DAM posts
on Monday, November 5, until 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 6.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Account Representative
or the Customer Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

Rich,

I saw Dale last Thursday at a wind conference here in Boston ... he is not
up and running yet but needs to start selling power and told me he would
call you ...only thing is I did not have access to your number at the time
so I gave Dale Bill's tel. number.

Rogers,

Enron Energy Services, Inc. ("EESI") submitted application to become a NEPO=
OL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=
L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=
e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=
licy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=
r Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =
Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =
corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =
Guaranty required by NEPOOL.

EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=
e amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=
une 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =
England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=
 and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=
rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=
e amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=
elivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=
 to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=
ed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=
 Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=
o the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=
on with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=
 with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=
hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=
esolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=
tober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20

I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=
ny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=
 Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=
g invoices for "other" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=
50,000.  The "other" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=
, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=
eff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the "=
other" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=
st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=
as issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=
ber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =
23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =
resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =
company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=
rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=
king diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=
 FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=
mance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20

I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=
ticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=
n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=
he matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=
ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=
he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=
 following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=
ctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=
rom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=
 that "Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=
 financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=
f 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=
h qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=
ontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=
ations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=
erefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =
to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them."  According to Da=
n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the=
 Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ=
ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter =
occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was=
 automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, =
when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a=
ctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem=
ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,=
 and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc=
idence.

According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce=
edings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso=
lved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE=
.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to=
 EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti=
 is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with re=
presentatives from ISO-NE.

I left message for Molly Harris as you requested. I was able to speak to De=
nise Furey and Nichole Gunter, who both indicated that they would speak wit=
h Molly as they all work together. =20

Let me know if you need any additional information.

All, 
In the future, please refrain from parking in the area on the west side of the building when working at or visiting the Austin Facility.  This area is reserved for General Motors.  It is easily identified.  The lot has blue striping and is marked "GM Parking Only". In most cases, there is ample parking in the front, rear and on the east side of the building. In the rare instance that parking is unavailable, please check in at the security desk and you will be directed to an overflow parking area. 

Thank you for your cooperation.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Jeremy - Richard Ring is going to do a full analysis and write up on this deal and present it to us so we can make a decision about assumption/rejection.  He should have it ready for us the end of this week.

Does EES have anyone that can assist in this ? From where I sit, I wouldn't know where to begin to search for the information. I believe Murray has addressed the acute issue with respect to the SC role, but we will need to get to the bottom of this to determine whether or not we assume or reject. Lets touch base tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jeremy

Subject:	RE: Green Power Partners

Jeremy,

In order to value the PPA, I need the following:

	1)  Total Energy generated by the Generating Facility (monthly MWhs, historical volumes)
	2)  Enron Wind's deliveries of energy to EES (resold to Lost Arrow)
	3)  Enron Wind's deliveries of energy to LADWP
	4)  Number of Green Tickets issued (monthly, historical)
	5)  Repair and/or maintenance schedule, whether planned or not
	6)  Fees/charges to EES from APX for administration of Green Tickets purchased

Right now it looks like EES is $11/MWh out-of-the-money on this deal.  That is, the forward curve for power from Feb '02 - Dec '02 is approximately $26.50/MWh (flat), Green Tickets trade for about $1.50/MWh, and EES's contract price is $39/MWh minus market energy price (~$12.50/MWh).

Todd

I think that the following, which Murray has begun, is what we need to do:

- Perry and/or Richter need to provide a valuation of the PPA
- based on that we can determine whether or not we want to accept it or reject it, that being said, we could also ask Wind Corp to provide us with a price for buying out of the deal so that they are free to sell to someone else and then of course, they can put their claim in as an unsecured creditor for the amounts due to them.


Thoughts ?

Dear Market Participants

Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
Customer Relations

This past Wednesday, FERC approved the NYISO's virtual bidding program, subject to a modification that reduces the required collateral for program participants by 50%. (Enron, among others, had expressed concern about the high level of required collateral in its comments.) As noted in the ISO's attached announcement, Virtual Bidding will commence on November 1.

Hi Richard,
 
Who would be a good contact regarding contract settlement between EEMC and PGE&T in NEPOOL?  Apparently, EEMC should be receiving $$ from PGE&T. 
 
Thanks,

Per our conversation, BGE is implementing a fee (eff. 7/1/02) referenced in the BGE Electricity Supplier Manual (pg. 32) , as follows:

	"Charges for Coordination Services provided under this Tariff and Supplier Coordination Agreement"


The fee will be invoiced to us monthly, and is distinguishable from the forecasting and scheduling services the desk provides, and for which .25 per MWh has been included in your deal costs.  BGE defines the Scheduling Coordinator as:

"An entity recognized the the PJM OI and qualified to act on behalf of the Electricity Supplier in taking such actions with PJM as are necessary in order for Electricity Supplier's obligations as defined in this Tariff to be met, including the submission of energy schedules to the PJM OI. and that either is (1) a member of the PJM interconnection, L.L.C., or (2) the PJM-approved agent for scheduling purposes, of one or more Electricity Suppliers that are members of the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C."


Per Schedule 1 in the same document, the fee will be:

	"$30/MW/month...Based on the average daily Electricity Supplier's MW peak load contribution for the month"

This calculates to approximately .063 per MWh based on an assumed 65% load factor (.041 at 100% load).


Although the BGE TC for the Index product (Page 1, PRICE, Bullet 2.) specifies that the customer will be responsible to pay or reimburse us for all "Special Utility Charges" as further defined in the Master Agreement, this is going to be a recurring, ongoing charge rather than a special charge.

We therefore believe that this charge is more appropriately a component of the EESI Energy Price as defined in the TC, and recommend that the definition be modified to include the BGE Coordination Services Charge as defined in the BGE Electricity Supplier Manual.  This charge would then be allocated to the customers based on total monthly load (as are several of the ISO charges).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks-
Michele

Please see attached.  I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.  I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering, which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include.  

I am not convinced that we can't express the basis as the "Fixed Basis" rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition, so I have left it the way it was.  I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.  It is really an optic (customers always have the right to request a restructured price) and I'm not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong market-based reason to do so.

State. We've just posted the course on our web site at

http://www.nyiso.com/services/training/cinfo/index.html

does not include Billing and Accounting details. The program will address
the latest system updates, however, and rigorously covers all marketplace
topics.

The course will be conducted at the Hyatt Regency Houston, 1200 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas, from 8:30 am  Tuesday December 11 until 3:00 pm
Thursday December 13. If you're interested, we suggest you register early
as we expect a healthy turn-out. In order to get a realistic count, there
will be a $300 charge for no-shows, or for cancellations not made by 12:00
noon Monday, December 3.

Please call Customer Relations at (518) 356-6060, if you have any questions
regarding the course, or Debbie Doyle at (518) 356-6274 regarding

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.
"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
By Kristen McNamara

10/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday.

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was
at risk for expulsion from New England's market.
  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said.

  "I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, "and it's never
been in the news," said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. "My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion."

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices.

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said.

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power
market, to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the
wrong person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said.

  "Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit," Mahoney said.

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default.

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said.

  "I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a
participant to find itself out of compliance," Doot said. "Those things have
in fact happened from time to time."

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

>From a mark to market perspective, the fixed basis as it is defined in the MD and NJ Index products include deal costs which are not considered market related, thus MTM accounting rules do not apply.  By defining the index as PJM plus $0.0[   ] per kWh, we effectively tie the deal cost to the index and mark the transactions accordingly.  Please see my note previous note on this issue.  

""EESI Energy Price" means the sum of the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus $0.0[    ] per kWh."

All references to the fixed basis as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language.  

I have also changed the Contract Price language so that the incentive is given to the customer on his actual usage up to anticipated usage: 

" For each Billing Cycle from the commencement of the Transaction Term through July 31, 2003, an amount equal to what the Utility Invoice would have been for such Account had you purchased the Account's Actual Usage from the Utility under the Prevailing Utility Tariff Rate, minus, $0.0[   ] per kWh of Actual Usage up to the Anticipated Usage.  You will also be responsible for and pay, or reimburse us if we have paid, Special Utility Charges (to the extent not already included in the Prevailing Utility Tariff Rate) and Taxes."

Language that describes the customers "option" to enter a fixed price agreement with EES is also necessary:

To the extent a Fixed Energy Price has not already been agreed to, you may request that we provide a fixed price quote for energy to replace the EESI Energy Price (a Fixed Energy Price) by contacting us between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., central time, of any Business Day requesting a quote for such Fixed Energy Price; Upon receipt of your request, we will notify you of the Fixed Energy Price, the length of time you have to either accept or reject the Fixed Energy Price and any additional credit terms or other contractual terms relative to such Fixed Energy Price.  If you accept such Fixed Energy Price within the specified time, we will send to you for your execution a written confirmation or amendment to this Confirmation documenting any confirmed Fixed Energy Price, any additional credit terms and any other applicable modifications to this Confirmation.  If such Fixed Energy Price is not confirmed by both you and us, the EESI Energy Price will remain unchanged.

The Mid Form contracts will be needed and should read similarly. 


The answer to your question below is that the difference between the two is the "basis" and the energy component is a wash:
 
"IS THIS THE RIGHT DEFINITION OF SPOT ENERGY PRICE HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE INDEX PORTION OF THE EESI ENERGY PRICE; IS IT JUST THE BASIS AND THE ENERGY COMPONENT IS A WASH?"

"Spot Energy Price" means the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus all non-Utility charges arising from uplifts, installed capacity, ancillary services, losses, congestion and other ISO charges or administrative fees incurred in connection with delivery of energy to the Delivery Point. 

There is no need for Excess Usage Language in the contract, however, deficiency language will apply as follows:

There will be no additional charges for Excess or Deficiency Usage through July 31, 2003.

>From August 1, 2003 through the end of the Transaction Term, there will be no additional charges for Excess Usage; however, for each kWh of Deficiency Usage at each Account for each month, you will pay us an amount equal to the 0.0[ ] per kWh multiplied by the Deficiency Usage.


Please contact me if you have further questions.

Subject:	Re: NJ Index plus   

Why is this formulation of the EESI Energy Price  any different than saying "plus the Fixed Basis" and then defining the Fixed Basis as a $/kWh amount?  Isn't it exactly the same?  We've written it the way it was before so it is easy to plug in the fixed basis number.

Why have you changed the calculations of excess and deficiency usage charges during the index period?  Why have you used the reference to a Management Fee in the new language?  Why are there no charges for Excess Usage during the index period--are you really giving them the fised basis position for unlimited usage?

Subject:	NJ Index plus

Following today's discussions with the Transaction Accounting group to discuss fixed basis Mark to Market, Product Management has modified the definition of the EESI Energy Price.   

The conclusion of the discussion with Transaction Accounting was that the Index product does in fact create a commodity position that the commodity desk can "choose" to manage.  The "revenue" position that is created when the contract is signed with the customer will be settled based on the published PJM Zone LMP, nevertheless the commodity desk may choose to manage their "cost" otherwise.  The proposed fixed basis will be treated as ONE with the index in determining the EESI Energy Price.   This approach is very similar in nature to the definition of the "Plus" that is defined in the ENovative Lite Energy Service Agreement for Gas products.  

Therefore, the EESI Energy Price will now read:

""EESI Energy Price" means the sum of the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus $0.0[    ] per kWh."

Please see the attached transaction confirmation and comment on the new definition of the fixed basis.  All references to the fixed basis ("Management Fee")  as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language.  


 

Please provide your comments accordingly.

Thanks

Re: Organizational Changes

Over the last several quarters, EES has successfully implemented a number o=
f new business models, organizational structures and processes.  The result=
 has been tremendous customer contracting in the U.S., Canada and Western E=
urope in 2001.  In all cases, EES's large consumer market share has expande=
d and we have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consume=
r market - Enron Direct.  This effort, in itself is impressive, especially =
given that at the same time, EES has had to significantly restructure and r=
e-tool its execution capabilities, systems and mid and back offices.  I can=
 assure you that these processes, systems and capabilities are improving.  =
This is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES=
, EES risk and Enron Networks.

In that light, I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes =
which demonstrate our continued commitment to the European market and the c=
reation of a new exciting channel in the Enron Direct USA business.

A)=09EES Europe:

Effective immediately, Sean Holmes will be moving to London to manage EES E=
urope.  We believe that Sean has the broad based experience in the EES busi=
ness model, products, retail energy risk management and demand side managem=
ent to take the European business to next level. Charlie Crossley-Cooke wil=
l manage our small consumer (Enron Direct) franchise.  This franchise has c=
ontinued to grow, in the UK and on the continent, and has provided signific=
ant income to EES in 2001. Enron Direct will also continue to provide mid a=
nd back office services to EES Europe. Paul Turner will manage our large co=
nsumer business in Western Europe.  Paul will be replacing Stuart Rexrode w=
ho will be returning to EES in Houston.  Over the last few quarters, our pe=
netration of this market, primarily in the UK, has grown dramatically with =
completed contracts with Sainsbury, Guiness, Kraft and Pirelli.  Many of th=
ese transactions include gas, power and demand side management.  We would l=
ike to thank Stuart for all his hard work toward the continued growth of th=
e European franchise.

We are also pleased to announce the formation of the European Product Group=
 led by Roy Poyntz.  This group will lead the development of new products a=
nd services for both the large and small consumer markets.  As in North Ame=
rica, its main role will be to ensure viable and innovative products are co=
ntinually available in the pipeline to ensure the continued growth of the E=
uropean business. The Product Group will also ensure product diversity betw=
een gas, power and energy efficiency products.  We continue to be committed=
 to the development of the demand side management aspects of our business t=
o differentiate us from our competitors. On a final note, the EES Europe co=
mmodity structuring and DSM groups will now report to Sean in addition to C=
harlie, Paul and Roy.=20

As part of this change, Deb Merrill will be assuming the lead role in Deal =
Management in EES USA replacing Sean.  Deb has been an integral part of EES=
 from many years and we believe she has all the experience and skill sets t=
o effectively manage and build on this integral function in EES USA.

B)=09Enron Direct USA - Dealer Network

Effective immediately, Stuart Rexrode will manage this new sales channel in=
side Enron Direct USA.  Stuart will be building this new more sophisticated=
 agent selling channel by creating franchise like relationships with numero=
us "dealers" across the US.  This dealer network will consist of small know=
ledgeable entrepreneurs and consultants that have been in the energy market=
s for many years and have great regional expertise and customer relationshi=
ps. EES will provide a franchise like program where we provide resources an=
d products to this agent base in exchange for exclusive provision of sales =
