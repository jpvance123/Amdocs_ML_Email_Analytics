Ooops, meant to say assigning All transactions with "EPMI" to "Morgan" NOT 
"ENA"!!!  See what happens when I rush around like a chicken with her head 
cut off!

To Rhonda,

My bad...It looks like MEGA is assigning ALL of its physical power positions 
with EPMI to ENA.  The attached spreadsheet below has the options in the 
lower section, which should really be part of the "to be assigned" group.

To All,

Sorry for the confusion,

Wendy

Please find attached a spreadsheet which matches up the MEGA Deals with the 
EPMI deals to be assigned from MEGA to Morgan.  Please review deal numbers 
for accuracy and then review the confirms to ensure that all necessary West 
Product Definitions are either in the confirm.  If they are not in the 
confirm, they need to be identified in the amendment to the Master Agreement 
with Morgan.


Thanks,
Wendy

Debbie Hart at Morgan Stanley is the contact (212/761-5920).   Can I go ahead 
and forward the proposed amendments to MEGA?  Do I need to tell her it is 
contingent on amending our contract with Morgan?

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft 
that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:

1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an 
amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral 
provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.  
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop 
the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Call me if you have any questions.

The following deal confirmations do not contain the product definitions for 
SP-15 delivery (CAISO) and Palo Verde/Mid Columbia (West Firm)

226189 (SP15)
220051 (SP15)
220052 (SP15)
249547 (PV)
200536 (MidC)

Therefore, the amendment will need to contain the definition of CAISO Energy 
and West Firm Energy.

In an hour or so, I will be sending Carol a paragraph to be inserted in the 
amending agreement which will fix the product definitions in the relevant 
confirmation letters.----cgy

Carol,

I tried to contract Morgan yesterday but Debbie Hart said she would have to 
call me back.  If I don't hear from here by noon, I will give her another 
call.  Also, I am assuming that you will be handling adding the product 
definitions as indicated below in the amendment.  Let me know if this is not 
the case.
