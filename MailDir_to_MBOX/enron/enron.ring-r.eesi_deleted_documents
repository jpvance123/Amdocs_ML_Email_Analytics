NEWS AND EVENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
President's Budget Supports Efficiency, Renewable Energy

President Bush released his administration's proposed
$2.13 trillion federal budget for fiscal year (FY) 2003 on
Monday. Although the budget emphasis is on the war on
terrorism and U.S. homeland security, the budget maintains
funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy
programs, while providing new tax incentives to encourage
the use of these technologies (see second story below). See
the full budget on the White House Web site at:
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2003/>.

The proposed overall budget for DOE's Office of Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which funds this
newsletter and the EREN Web site, remains nearly steady,
increasing about 0.8 percent above FY 2002 funding levels.
Funding for renewable energy programs increases 5.5 percent
in the budget, with significant funding boosts for hydrogen,
hydropower, and solar building technology research and
development, as well as for programs that encourage
renewable energy use on Indian reservations and internationally.
However, the research budget for concentrating solar power
technologies suffers a cut of 86 percent.

Overall funding for energy efficiency programs decreases by
about 1.3 percent. The largest change is a budget increase
of 25 percent for the Federal Energy Management Program,
which helps the federal government reduce its energy use.
EERE estimates that the combined energy efficiency and
renewable energy programs, which cost about $1.3 billion
per year, will save the country between $76 billion and
$125 billion in energy costs by 2020.

See EERE's "Budget-in-Brief" on the EREN Web site at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/budget/budget_summary03.html>.

See also the "Renewable Energy Resources" and "Energy
Conservation" sections under the "Detailed Budget
Justifications" heading of DOE's budget request, posted at:
<http://www.mbe.doe.gov/budget/03budget/index.htm>.

In his announcement of the DOE budget, Secretary of
Energy Spencer Abraham specifically noted that the
proposed budget will support the President's commitment to
double funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program
over the next 10 years, and will provide roughly $150 million
for FreedomCAR, which aims to develop the infrastructure
and technologies needed for hydrogen-powered fuel-cell
vehicles. See the DOE press release at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/febpr/pr02016.htm>.

The administration's proposed budget is only the first step in
the budget process. Both the House and Senate will now
start working on a series of bills to set a budget and appropriate
funds. For FY 2002, for instance, the President's budget
originally proposed cutting funding for EERE, but as shown
in the budget documents cited above, funding for FY 2002
ended up higher than the previous year's funding. See the
news about last year's proposed budget in the April 11,
2001, edition of the EREN Network News at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/apr11_01.html>.


Budget Includes Tax Incentives for Renewables, CHP, Hybrids

The President's budget for fiscal year 2002 includes
$9.1 billion in tax incentives over 10 years to encourage the
use of renewable energy, combined heat and power (CHP)
systems, and energy-efficient vehicles.

For power producers, the budget includes a new 10-percent
investment tax credit for qualifying CHP systems, an
extension of the tax credit for landfill methane power plants,
an extension of the production tax credit (PTC) through
2005, and an expansion of the PTC to include more biomass
energy facilities. The PTC provides renewable power
producers with a tax break of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (in
1992 dollars, adjusted for inflation) and was formerly
applicable only to electricity produced from wind power,
poultry waste, and biomass power produced from dedicated
energy crops.

The PTC expired in December, leading to a slowdown in the
wind energy business. For example, Vestas Wind Systems
A/S shifted 1,200 employees to half-time work in January,
with the expectation that the slowdown will continue for
12 weeks. See the Vestas press release at:
<http://www.vestas.com/nyheder/presse/2002/UK/fond20020124_UK.html>.

The budget also includes a tax credit for the average
American -- people that install solar hot water or solar
electric systems on their homes would earn a tax credit of
15 percent of the cost of the systems, including installation.
The credit has a maximum of $2,000 per person for solar hot
water systems and another $2,000 per person for solar
photovoltaic systems.

People buying hybrid electric vehicles would also earn a tax
credit of up to $4,000, with the amount determined by both
the performance of the hybrid system and the vehicle's fuel
economy. When fuel-cell vehicles become available, they'll
earn an even higher tax credit -- at least $4,000 and up to
$8,000, depending on the vehicle's fuel economy.

And fuel producers don't get left out of the equation -- the
budget also proposes extending the tax credit and excise tax
exemption for ethanol and methanol from renewable
sources.

See pages 71-73, 80 and 99 (PDF pages 75-77, 84 and 103)
of the "Analytical Perspectives" section of the President's
budget at:
<http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2003/>.


Alliant Energy Seeks Renewable Power Sources for Iowa

Alliant Energy announced in late January that it plans to add
enough renewable energy generating capacity in Iowa to
produce up to 150,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year
-- enough to meet the annual power needs of more than
20,000 households. A wind power plant that produces power
one-third of the time would require a capacity of about
50 megawatts to generate that much electricity. The
company serves 464,000 electric customers in Iowa, and
intends to add the renewable power capacity by the end of
2003. The company has posted a request for proposals on
its Web site; proposals are due by April 2nd. See the Alliant
Energy press release, with a link to the request for
proposals, at:
<http://www.alliantenergy.com/news/news.php?issueID=237>.


DOE Awards More Than $500,000 for Metal Casting Research

DOE announced last week its award of $533,328 over three
years to a technical consortium, headed by the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor, for research into ways to improve the
casting of light metal alloys. By studying how heat is
transferred between the mold casting and the metal, the
researchers hope to develop lighter, stronger, and less-
expensive molds. One aim of the research is to reduce the
amount of scrap and reworked materials in the aluminum
mold and die casting industry by eight percent. The
projected energy benefits in the metal casting industry alone
over the next ten years are estimated to be 36.6 trillion Btu
-- enough energy to power all the homes in Arkansas for a
year. See the DOE press release at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/febpr/pr02015.htm>.


Explosion at FuelCell Energy Plant Delays Shipments

An explosion racked the production line of FuelCell Energy's
manufacturing plant in Torrington, Connecticut, on January 14th,
slightly injured five employees. A buildup of solvent fumes
caused the explosion on the company's new "tape casting"
line, which is used to manufacture fuel cell components. The
company emphasized that the explosion was not caused by
hydrogen, nor was it caused by the operation of one of its
fuel cells.

FuelCell Energy has continued to assemble fuel cells at the
facility since the explosion, but is expecting delays of four to
six weeks in its fuel cell shipments. The company shut down
both tape-casting lines as a safety precaution, but expects to
restart the older line in mid-February. The new tape-casting
line was recently installed at a cost of $1.7 million. See
FuelCell Energy's Form 8-K filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (used to make investors aware of
any significant company events) on the company's Web site at:
<http://www.fce.com/site/investor/press/releases/2002/01_31_02.html>.


New Energy Corporation Retracts Claim of Solar Contract

New Energy Corporation announced last week that it had
mistakenly claimed to have a contract to deliver solar
electricity to Teixeira Farms of Santa Maria, California, and
that in fact no such contract exists. The company now claims
to have purchase orders from Distributed Power Systems for
the installation of four solar electric systems, each with a
generating capacity of one megawatt. The original story was
covered in the January 9th edition of the EREN Network
News:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2002/jan09_02.html>.

Since January 18th, the trading of New Energy stock has
been suspended by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over "questions involving the adequacy and
accuracy of public disclosures," in particular, "the value of
certain power generation contracts, the existence and size of
certain purchase orders for solar chips and its partner's
relationship with the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power." Last week, Stratos Research, LLC, an investment
research firm, announced that it had suspended coverage of
New Energy and had removed its research report on the
company from its Web site, due to concerns that the report
"may contain factual errors." See all of the relevant press
releases by selecting "Press Release" on the New Energy
Web site at: <http://www.newenergyco.com/>.

EIA Issues U.S. Renewable Energy Maps

DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA) completed a
new regional series of renewable energy maps last week.
The Renewable Energy Map series includes maps of each of
the nine U.S. census divisions, plus individual maps of
California, Alaska, and Hawaii. The maps attempt to indicate
all renewable energy resources in each region, and also
show the location of all renewable energy power plants with
a net summer capacity of 1 megawatt or more. See the EIA
Renewable Energy Maps at:

                          ENERGY VIEWS

-----------------------------------------------------------------
           Changing Perspectives on the Energy Industry
-----------------------------------------------------------------

                   ARE YOU ACTING PRUDENTLY?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Energy industry seems to be in a somewhat tenuous state. As
credit and accounting standards have come unglued the integrity
of the biggest players is called into question. Accounting firms
have claimed their accounting practices to be "creative and
aggressive" while their clients claim that there actions were
"not unethical", with apparent stress on the "not" part. One now
battered marketer has been specifically accused of "suspending
the rules of corporate ethics and perhaps even put corporate
morality on vacation".

Words like scandal, allegations, suspicions and cover-up have
become rank in the industry. CEOs have been asked to leave their
positions, executives have been forcibly terminated while another
commits suicide; and the investigations continue, including
criminal ones. The situation is sobering.

It seems like these last few years have been full of bubbles
bursting as we all collectively share a cold bath of economic
reality. The techs tumbled and the stock markets followed, the
electricity market (at least in California) imploded, real bombs
are exploding all over the place and the mightiest energy
marketer has fallen; and it won't be getting back up. The biggest
bankruptcy in US history will definitely leave its mark on all of
us. To think, we thought the troubles of PG&E and the Cal-PX was
big news.

Arthur Levitt, former SEC boss, suggests that "Enron's collapse
did not occur in a vacuum ... (and was) ... was partly a result
of a culture of gamesmanship among go-go businesses that believe
it's okay to bend the rules". This is a fundamental folly of the
industry as people with limited energy knowledge (and integrity) 
play games with other peoples money and not understanding or
caring about the consequences. It is not surprising that the
stock value of other marketers is also beginning to plummet.

So the question of the day is: are you acting prudently? It is
insufficient to assume that might is right or size is protection.
Contracting with the largest does not secure your contract; no
more than using the largest accounting firm ensures your books
are right. We all leave a paper trail and that trail is visible
in a moonless night during a California forced blackout, even if
you order your accounting firm to delete the emails and shred the
"evidence".

In working with our clients, we have come to see that information
does not receive its due respect. Perhaps it's the fault of the
Internet and the information overload factor, but not respecting
information is costly. We have witnessed "lost deals" and poor
follow-up. We have seen the cost of not rigorously following
corporate trade, risk credit procedures and surely we have seen
the result of blind faith in the big guys. To this end we
actively support our clients to equip themselves to effectively
manage large amounts of market information.

Energy market participants, more so than perhaps other
industries, must heed the requirement for prudence. For many
prudence is a forgotten tradition from the franchise days.
Prudence in competitive markets, which all energy markets are to
some degree, means a lot more now than it did in the franchise
era. We are all under the purvey of the public, the investor and
the regulators. Not to recognize this fact can have severe
economic ramifications. Prudence now means having trade, risk and
credit policies and procedures, having the tools to manage and
analyze data and foremost, developing the ability to internally
make the right judgment calls.

manage its operation in uncertain markets.  For more information

-----------------------------------------------------------------
      Having the Information and Doing Nothing About It
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It seems evident that Anderson, the government and Enron itself,
had privy to a lot of financial data that clearly indicated the 
eventual collapse of Enron.

*  Andersen contemplated dropping Enron as a client nearly one 
   year ago because of concerns due to Enron's accounting
   methodology.
*  The White House oversaw a study in October 2001 of economic
   repercussions of an    Enron collapse.
*  Sherron Watkins, a senior Enron Executive, wrote to Enron's
   chairman, Ken Lay, "I am incredibly nervous that we will
   implode in a wave of accounting scandals." last August 2001"
*  The writing was clearly on the wall but most were unable to
   react to the intelligence. It    all comes down to the
   lemming factor; we can see the cliff but just cannot
   avoid jumping.

Many in the industry suffer badly from the chronic inability to
react in a timely manner. This failure often results in severe
negative economic impacts. Either policy is not in place to allow
affirmative reaction or staff does not adhere to the policies
that exist.

Good corporate policy is the corner stone of sound market
participation

Interior Department Budget to Boost Geothermal Energy

Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton announced in mid-
January that the Interior Department's proposed budget for
next year will include funds to encourage geothermal energy
development on public lands. The President's budget
proposal for fiscal year 2003 will include $350,000 for the
Bureau of Land Management to improve access for
geothermal energy leasing in California, Nevada, Utah,
Oregon, and New Mexico. The budget will also include
$500,000 for the U.S. Geological Survey to produce
improved and updated information on geothermal resources.
See the Department of Interior press release at:
<http://www.doi.gov/news/020118a.html>.

Secretary Norton's announcement came as a follow-up to
the "National Conference on Opportunities to Expand
Renewable Energy on Public Lands," co-hosted by DOE and
the Interior Department in November of last year. See the
December 5th edition of the EREN Network News at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/dec05_01.html>.

Further details of President Bush's budget proposal were
anticipated in last night's State of the Union Address, but the
text of the speech was not available at press time. The
President is also expected to release his full budget proposal
next week. Watch for further news of the President's budget
in future editions of the EREN Network News.


Large Wind Power Plant Under Evaluation for Nantucket Sound

Cape Wind Associates, LLC is currently proposing to build a
420-megawatt wind power plant in the waters offshore of
Massachusetts. If built, the facility will be the first offshore
wind facility in the United States and the largest U.S. wind
power plant yet. The company plans to erect 170 turbines in
a part of Nantucket Sound called Horseshoe Shoal. A
submarine cable system consisting of two power lines, each
115 kilovolts, will transmit the power from the facility to the
shore at Yarmouth, Massachusetts.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced on Monday
that it will require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
for the facility, which will be built on state and federal waters
stretching across about 28 square miles of the sound. The
site is closest to land at Point Gammond, which is 4.1 miles
away. The Corps will work closely with the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, which is also performing an environmental
review. On March 6th and 7th, the Corps will hold public
meetings to help determine the range of issues the EIS
should address and to identify significant issues that should
be analyzed in depth. See the press release on the Corps'
New England District Web site at:
<http://www.nae.usace.army.mil/news/2002-16.html>.

Cape Wind expects to begin construction on the facility in
2004 and complete it by 2005. See the Cape Wind Web site
at: <http://www.capewind.org/learning/pglan02.htm>.

The Web site also includes a map of the site with overlays of
shipping channels, ferry routes, and airplane flight lanes, as
well as a link to computer-simulated views of the site from
the shore, at:
<http://www.capewind.org/benefiting/sitev02.htm>.

Pennsylvania also hopes to increase its wind power
capacity: the state's Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) issued a permit for a new 60-megawatt wind facility in
Wayne County last week. National Wind Power and Orion
Energy LLC are developing the project, which will consist of
47 turbines on two parcels of land covering 858 acres. See
the DEP press release at:
<http://www.dep.state.pa.us/newsreleases/default.asp?ID=1468>.


Acquisitions a Growing Trend in Solar and Wind Power

While wind power developers are at work in Massachusetts
and Pennsylvania, acquisitions appear to be growing in
popularity as a way to obtain wind power capacity. For
example, Entergy Corporation, a global energy company,
announced in mid-month its purchase of a majority
ownership in the newly completed Top of Iowa Wind Farm,
an 80-megawatt facility in northern Iowa. See the Entergy
press release at:
<http://www.entergy.com/news_database/news-detail.asp?ID=306>.

Shell WindEnergy Inc. followed suit shortly thereafter with its
purchase of the 80-megawatt Llano Estacando Wind Ranch
near Amarillo, Texas, from Cielo Wind Power, LLC. Shell
WindEnergy is part of Shell Renewables, one of five core
businesses of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.

But for Shell Renewables, the big news last week was its
buyout of solar photovoltaic partners Siemens AG and E. ON
Energie AG. Their joint venture, called Siemens und Shell
Solar, will now be owned entirely by Shell and will be known
as Shell Solar.

The wind and solar purchases are part of the Shell Group's
plan to invest up to $1 billion in renewable energy
technologies over the next five years. See the Shell
Renewables press releases at:
<http://www2.shell.com/home/Framework?siteId=rw-br>.


Hawaii Resort Dedicates 250-Kilowatt Solar Power System

The Mauni Lani Resort on the Big Island of Hawaii dedicated
its new 250-kilowatt solar photovoltaic system last week. The
sun-tracking system was manufactured and installed by
PowerLight Corporation. The installation brings the resort's
total solar power capacity to 500 kilowatts, which PowerLight
claims as the most solar electric generating capacity of any
resort in the world. The resort projects savings of $5 million
over the next 25 years by using solar power. See the
PowerLight press release at:
<http://www.powerlight.com/pr/012202powertracker.html>.

Part of the resort's solar generating capacity is actually on
the move -- it's a fleet of solar-powered golf carts. A
photovoltaic canopy on each cart helps keep its battery
charged, significantly reducing the resort's use of grid power
to recharge the carts. PowerLight just delivered 60 of the
carts to the resort, which plans to convert its entire fleet to
solar power by the end of 2003. See the PowerLight press
release at:
<http://www.powerlight.com/pr/012202suncaddy.html>.

The demand for solar power systems grew significantly in
2001. At California's Sacramento Municipal Utility District
(SMUD), for example, nearly 1,200 kilowatts of solar
generating capacity was installed on more than 220 homes
and business in 2001 -- nearly seven times more than the
utility installed in 2000. That growth spurt helped SMUD to
achieve a total solar capacity of 10 megawatts, spread over
more than 1,000 solar power systems that were installed
through the utility's Solar Pioneers program. SMUD expects
the program to continue growing rapidly in 2002; to meet the
demand, the utility has tripled the number of staff and
contractors working on the program. See the SMUD press
release at:
<http://www.smud.org/info/02archive/0118_solar_landmark.html>.


New Zero-Emission Vehicle Rules On Hold in California

California's latest set of rules for Zero-Emission Vehicles
(ZEVs), issued by the state's Air Resources Board (ARB),
have failed to win approval from the California Office of
Administrative Law. The ARB announced last week that the
rules were apparently not approved because it failed to
follow proper procedures when giving notice of its proposed
changes to the program. ARB has 120 days to remedy the
situation, and it expects to meet that deadline. See the
notice on the ARB Web site at:
<http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/zev2001/zev2001.htm>.

New York, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with its own
version of the ZEV program. The state's current regulations
require ten percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be
ZEVs, which in practical terms means electric vehicles,
starting with Model Year 2005. Early this month, Governor
George E. Pataki announced an alternative approach for
automakers that starts a year earlier but includes credits for
vehicles with near-zero emissions -- vehicles referred to as
Partial ZEVs or PZEVs in the California rules. The new
approach also allows partial credits for PZEVs that use
alternative fuels or hybrid technologies. These changes are
similar to changes made in California by the ARB, but on a
slower timetable. See Governor Pataki's press release at:
<http://www.state.ny.us/governor/press/year02/jan4_02.htm>.

State standards for auto emissions are governed by unusual
rules: by federal law, only California can set stricter standards
than the federal standards, and other states must either
follow federal standards or adopt standards essentially equal
to California's. This approach helps keep the standards
manageable for automakers, but places California in a
leadership position. New York, Massachusetts, and Vermont
have followed California's lead on ZEV rules. Reportedly,
Massachusetts is now taking an approach similar to New York's,
and Vermont has not yet announced what approach it will take.


DOE Awards $8 Million for Weatherization in Texas, Oklahoma

DOE announced last week its award of $8 million to Texas
and Oklahoma for weatherization assistance to low-income
households. DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program
provides funds to state and local agencies, as well as Native
American tribes, for measures that improve the energy
efficiency of the homes of people that can least afford to
waste energy. The program provides comprehensive energy
auditing, health and safety diagnostic services, and whole-
house energy efficiency services, including air infiltration
reduction, insulation, heating system service, and measures
to reduce residents' use of electricity. See the DOE press
release at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/janpr/pr02010.htm>.

ENERGY FACTS AND TIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2001 Ranked as Second Warmest Year on Record

The year 2001 was the second warmest globally since
record keeping began in 1880, according to data released in
mid-January by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). Only 1998 ranked higher, and
temperatures that year were boosted by strong El Nino
conditions. In contrast, 2001 began with weak La Nina
conditions, which tend to depress global average
temperatures. Temperatures in the United States were also
above average; the year ranked as the sixth warmest since
record keeping began in 1895. See the report on NOAA's
National Climatic Data Center Web site at:
<http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2001/ann/ann.html>.

Conditions appear ripe for 2002 to become a record-
breaking year: according to NOAA's Climate Prediction
Center, the tropical Pacific Ocean is warming, a trend which
could lead to an El Nino by early Spring. However, NOAA
cautions that it is too early to predict the magnitude or
duration of the anticipated El Nino. See the NOAA press
release at:
<http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s849.htm>.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

TOP STORY: BUSH SPEECH FORESHADOWS BUDGET CRUNCH, ENERGY BILL BATTLE
President Bush laid the groundwork Tuesday during his State-of-the-Union 
speech for the largest increase for defense spending in two decades. 
Coupled with upwards of $35 billion for homeland security spending, many

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

Richard, Rick, and Paul:

Can you please go scope out a spot on 6 in ECN as soon as possible (today).  Please notify Tina Holcombe of the location so that she can designate for the upcoming churn (computer and telephone move). Once on ECN6 Deb will work to finalize a permanent floor plan.

Deb - Richard is out today.  Could you please locate a spot for him and notify Tina.  Deb - also, if Liqun Pan, Oliver Jones and others have already moved to ECN 6 and still have phone lines and computers in ECS 5 you may want to forward their info (locations - old and present) so that they can be included on this churn as well. 

Thanks everyone,

It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

TOP STORY: SMOG LINKED TO ASTHMA IN CHILDREN
Active children who live in smoggy cities are more likely to develop asthma 
than active children in less polluted cities, says a decade-long study to 
be released Saturday. This is the first study to show that smog can cause 
sickness in otherwise healthy children.

Richard, Rick, and Paul:

Can you please go scope out a spot on 6 in ECN as soon as possible (today).  Please notify Tina Holcombe of the location so that she can designate for the upcoming churn (computer and telephone move). Once on ECN6 Deb will work to finalize a permanent floor plan.

Deb - Richard is out today.  Could you please locate a spot for him and notify Tina.  Deb - also, if Liqun Pan, Oliver Jones and others have already moved to ECN 6 and still have phone lines and computers in ECS 5 you may want to forward their info (locations - old and present) so that they can be included on this churn as well. 

Thanks everyone,
Rogers

           CUT BACKS IN 2002: BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT
                  OR JUST PLAIN BUSINESS RISK?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

THE BIG BANG IN 2001

2001 was a year like no other. The magnitude of events and 
economic repercussions, have been difficult to manage for many. 
We, as industry participants, have witnessed tremendous 
uncertainty and price volatility, which resulted in stratospheric 
price increases and the collapse of energy markets. As markets 
died (actually returned to historical lows) and as industry 
participants filed for bankruptcy, we are left with the question 
"What next?".

INDUSTRY IN FLUX

The industry is in a state of flux once again and floundering 
badly. The California experiment and the Enron model proved to be 
economic disasters that may never be rivaled. After the fallout, 
who is left to blame? Do we scapegoat it to the California 
regulators, to those eager to make a buck or to an overriding 
failure of all us to recognize the complexity and unique nature 
of the energy industry.

CUTBACKS AND LAY-OFFS

The worrisome reaction of many industry participants (coast to 
coast), at this time, has been to dramatically cut capital 
spending and reduce staff. This may seem a safe option given the 
relative calm of energy prices, in our opinion this strategy may 
be suspect in the long-term. The forthcoming changes from 
regulators, and from within the industry itself, will be massive 
and will require significant resources to implement.

Will you be ready for the onslaught? Business protocol must 
change and that change will be all encompassing. US Federal 
Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, expressed confidence that there 
would be significant changes to accounting practices and 
corporate governance (of the energy industry) as a result of the 
Enron/Anderson scandal.

THE CERTAINTY OF CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY

If we have learned anything in the last six years, since the 
opening of the Alberta Power Pool on January 1 1996, it is that 
the market is violently uncertain. There is no indication that 
the industry will stabilize any time soon. The other not so 
obvious observation is that those corporations operating in 
competitive markets with solid infrastructure, effective trade 
and risk policy and the ability to intelligently analyze large 
amounts of data have come into 2002 in relatively good shape. The 
industry as it is currently situated suggests a need for some 
level of conservatism without compromising corporate integrity. 
Perhaps now is not the time to cutback, but rather to shore-up 
while there is a break in the storm.

HOW ARE YOU POSITIONED

What corporations should be asking is how actions I am taking 
today will impact tomorrow's business opportunities. We know many 
are cutting back on expenditures, but is this at the cost of risk 
exposure or lost opportunity. There is limited risk as long as 
prices are low; but we all know that the industry has thus far 
behaved outside of anybody's expectations. There is no reason why 
uncertainty will not continue to prevail.

ZE POWERGROUP CAN HELP

We have spent the better part of the last six years working 
diligently to equip our clients with nimbleness in and protection 
from volatile energy markets. As such, we moved from providing 
high-level strategic support for our clients to developing the

Britt,

I know this may seem silly but for the record, the electricity discount for all financial and physical commodity deals per the GSA Contract increases to 3.5% from 2.7%.  This means that for all the accounts which we currently service, we need to update the computer discount rate from the old rate (2.7%) to the new rate (3.5%). 

Please give me a call if you have questions and certainly let me know if this is a problem.

Thanks and I hope your holidays were relaxing.....,

Bill

TOP STORY: YUCCA TO GET OK FROM BUSH
President Bush's final approval to use Nevada's Yucca Mountain as the 
nation's nuclear waste repository could come as early as Monday, 
administration and congressional sources say. Energy Secretary Spencer 
Abraham approved the site last month, but Saturday is the earliest he would 
be allowed to formally recommend it to President Bush. Sources say Bush is 
expected to make a decision quickly in order to give Nevada as little time 
as possible to lobby Congress on the issue

TOP STORY: WHITE HOUSE FLOATS PLAN TO CUT CO2 EMISSIONS
The White House released an outline for cutting carbon dioxide emissions 
yesterday supporting technology and incentives instead of the world-wide 
emissions trading system as proposed in the Kyoto Protocol.  Although 
President Bush has not settled on details, the report on the economy, 
published by the White House, replaces setting fixed targets with 
emission-intensity targets that would expand or contract with economic 
growth. This system would grant the United States easier targets as long as 
economic growth continues to exceed emission growth, the report suggests.

In today's GREENWIRE:

TOP STORY: BUDGET BUMPS SECURITY FUNDING, OTHER ACCOUNTS MIXED
President Bush released his budget yesterday for fiscal year 2003, calling 
for more homeland security spending but cuts in non-defense environmental 
projects. Bush called for a $300 million cut in appropriations for the U.S. 
EPA (story #1). And the president called for a slight reduction in the 
Interior budget, meaning the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service 
will see budget cuts. (story #2). But the Bush administration is requesting 
a 40 percent increase in its 2003 Yucca Mountain Project budget. (story #3)
