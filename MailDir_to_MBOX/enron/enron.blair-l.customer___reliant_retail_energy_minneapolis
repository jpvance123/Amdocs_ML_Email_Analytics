Per my e-mail below, I am forwarding a draft of the letter to RER regarding the DDVC/SMS issue.  Please review the letter and provide any comments or concerns.  Bill is going to be in Minneapolis (at this point anyway) Tuesday through Friday of next week so I'd like to have it completed by the end of next week in order to be prepared to discuss the issue when RER.

Hey guys,

Bill talked with RER regarding this issue last week and committed to get a letter to them articulating our position with supporting provisions of the tariff.  Based on that conversation, the scheduled meeting was cancelled.  Moreover, he is reviewing RER's original dispute letter from March and we can determine course of action thereafter.

Dari - Did you receive my e-mail of late which had a few questions regarding Section 8 of the tariff? 

Thanks for your help and patience,
Vicki

	It was my understanding that Bill Fowler was going to meet with RER last week to discuss this matter.  Northern continues to stand firm on our interpretation of the tariff requirements regarding payment but marketing is to determine when and whether we will send a demand letter to RER.  We are waiting for marketing regarding how we will proceed.  Thanks MW

Laura,
Based on the response received from Sue and TK (below), please remind PNM of the 10,000 Dth PNR balance and ask them to nominate the gas off TW at their earliest convenience. The gas is currently "parked" at the Rio Puerco PNR point, POI# 500617. Since the Purchase Order# 27190 expired on 4/30/2000, PNM will have to use their current PNR contract (Cr# 27267).  I have asked Richard Hanagriff to transfer the quantities from PO# 27190 to Cr# 27267. 

In your discussions with PNM you might verify that Imbalance Statements should continue to be sent to Sally Prentice at Alvarado Square in Albuquerque, NM. (TW has been sending an imbalance statement on this 10,000 Dth to Sally each month)  

If you have any questions, please call me.

I agree with Sue.  I don't think they would pay up to this point.  Just have PNM get it out.

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

Kent,

Steve is requesting a ~ $60,000 reimbursement for the allocation error this summer.  Please call me when you have a moment to discuss this.

We need to strategize on our counter-proposal.

Tim,

In the attached file I have calculated the following charges that I have
incurred because of NNG incorrectly listing my project storage injection
rates in your allocation system. By far the biggest cost to me is the way we
have changed or nominations of natural gas from are suppliers as the
spreadsheet will show. We made this change in the nomination for July,
August & September. In calculating our nomination we look at what we could
put firm into storage, plant usage on none run days and SMS if available. If
this was fixed back in June when we asked what was going on with storage and
over runs into storage. I would have order large volumes of the Tier I
instead of purchasing the more costly Tier II. If we nominated the higher
Tier I volumes we expected to see DDVC charge of $.40 on all days trying to
over run into storage. That would have been the case the way your system was
set up. Instead I have these higher cost to my suppliers.

Please call me with any question on the spreadsheet. You can verify
Whitewater DDVC & SMS for September. I believe it was around the 18 or 19
when the problem was fixed.
